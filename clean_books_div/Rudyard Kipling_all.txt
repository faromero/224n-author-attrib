( <unk> ) the <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> body of a few score persons , controls the planet .
transportation is civilisation , our motto runs .
theoretically we do what we please , so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies .
practically , the <unk> .
confirms or <unk> all international arrangements , and , to judge from its last report , finds our tolerant , humorous , lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders .
'with the night mail [ 1 ] . '
[ footnote 1 : actions and reactions . ]
is n't it almost time that our planet took some interest in the proceedings of the <unk> board of control ?
one knows that easy communications nowadays , and lack of privacy in the past , have killed all curiosity among mankind , but as the board 's official reporter i am bound to tell my tale .
at <unk> a.m. , <name> 26 , a.d. <unk> , the board , sitting in london , was informed by de forest that the district of northern illinois had <unk> cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected till the board should take over and administer it direct .
every northern illinois freight and passenger tower was , he reported , out of action ; all district main , local , and guiding lights had been extinguished ; all general communications were dumb , and through traffic had been diverted .
no reason had been given , but he gathered unofficially from the mayor of chicago that the district complained of <unk> and invasion of privacy . '
as a matter of fact , it is of no importance whether northern illinois stay in or out of <unk> circuit ; as a matter of policy , any complaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation , lest worse follow .
by <unk> a.m. de forest , dragomiroff ( russia ) , takahira ( japan ) , and pirolo ( italy ) were <unk> to visit illinois and 'to take such steps as might be necessary for the <unk> of traffic and all that that implies .
' by 10 a.m. the hall was empty , and the four members and i were aboard what pirolo insisted on calling 'my leetle <unk> '  that is to say , the new <name> pirolo .
our planet prefers to know <name> pirolo as a gentle , <unk> enthusiast who spends his time near <unk> , inventing or creating new breeds of <unk> <unk> ; but there is another side to his nature  the manufacture of quaint inventions , of which the <name> pirolo is , perhaps , not the least surprising .
she and a few score <unk> of the same type embody his latest ideas .
but she is not comfortable .
an <unk> .
boat does not take the air with the <unk> lift of a liner , but shoots up <unk> like the <unk> ' of our ancestors , and makes her height at <unk> from the first .
that is why i found myself sitting suddenly on the large lap of <unk> arnott , who commands the <unk> .
fleet .
one knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a fleet somewhere on the planet , and that , theoretically , it exists for the purposes of what used to be known as <unk> . '
only a week before , while visiting a glacier <unk> behind <unk> , i had seen some squadrons making false <unk> far to the north while they <unk> round the pole ; but , naturally , it had never occurred to me that the things could be used in <name> .
said arnott to de forest as i staggered to a seat on the <unk> <unk> : 'we 're tremendously grateful to 'em in illinois .
we 've never had a chance of exercising all the fleet together .
i 've turned in a general call , and i expect we 'll have at least two hundred keels aloft this evening . '
'well aloft ? '
de forest asked .
'of course , sir .
out of sight till they 're called for . '
arnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent <unk> where the map of the <unk> atlantic slid along , degree by degree , in exact answer to our progress .
our dial already showed 320 <unk> .
and we were two thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines .
'now , where is this illinois district of yours ? '
said dragomiroff .
'one travels so much , one sees so little .
oh , i remember !
it is in north <name> . '
de forest , whose business it is to know the out districts , told us that it lay at the foot of lake michigan , on a road to nowhere in particular , was about half an hour 's run from end to end , and , except in one corner , as flat as the sea .
like most flat countries nowadays , it was heavily guarded against invasion of privacy by forced timber  <unk> spruce and <unk> , grown in five years .
the population was close on two millions , largely migratory between <name> and california , with a backbone of small farms ( they call a thousand acres a farm in illinois ) whose owners come into chicago for amusements and society during the <name> .
they were , he said , <unk> kind , quiet folk , but a little exacting , as all flat countries must be , in their notions of privacy .
there had , for instance , been no printed <unk> in illinois for twenty-seven years .
chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner or later developed into engines for invasion of privacy , which in turn might bring the old terror of crowds and blackmail back to the planet .
so <unk> were not .
'and that 's illinois , ' de forest concluded .
'you see , in the old days , she was in the <unk> of what they used to call " progress , " and chicago  ' <unk> ? '
said takahira .
'that 's the little place where there is <unk> 's statue of the nigger in flames ?
a fine bit of old work . '
'when did you see it ? '
asked de forest quickly .
'they only <unk> it once a year . '
'i know .
at thanksgiving .
it was then , ' said takahira , with a shudder .
'and they sang <unk> 's song , too . '
<unk> ! '
de forest whistled .
'i did not know that !
i wish you 'd told me before .
<unk> 's song may have had its uses when it was composed , but it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind . '
'it 's protective instinct , my dear fellows , ' said pirolo , rolling a cigarette .
'the planet , she has had her dose of popular government .
she suffers from inherited <unk> .
she has no  ah  use for crowds . '
dragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light .
'certainly , ' said the <unk> russian , 'the planet has taken all precautions against crowds for the past hundred years .
what is our total population to-day ?
six hundred million , we <name> ; five hundred , we think ; but  but if next year 's census shows more than four hundred and fifty , i myself <name> eat all the extra little babies .
we have cut the <unk> out  right out !
for a long time we have said to almighty god , " thank you , sir , but we do not much like your game of life , so we <name> not play . " '
<unk> , ' said arnott defiantly , 'men live a century apiece on the average now . '
'oh , that is quite well !
i am <name>  you are <name>  we are all <name> and happy because we are so few and we live so long .
only i think almighty god he <name> remember what the planet was like in the time of crowds and the plague .
perhaps he <name> send us nerves .
eh , pirolo ? '
the italian blinked into space .
'perhaps , ' he said , 'he has sent them already .
anyhow , you can not argue with the planet .
she does not forget the old days , and  what can you do ? '
'for sure we ca n't <unk> the world . '
de forest glanced at the map flowing smoothly across the table from west to east .
'we ought to be over our ground by nine to-night .
there wo n't be much sleep afterwards . '
on which hint we dispersed , and i slept till takahira waked me for dinner .
our ancestors thought nine hours ' sleep ample for their little lives .
we , living thirty years longer , feel ourselves defrauded with less than eleven out of the twenty-four .
by ten o'clock we were over lake michigan .
the west shore was <unk> , except for a dull <unk> at chicago , and a single <unk> light  its leading beam pointing north  at <unk> on our starboard bow .
none of the lake villages gave any sign of life ; and inland , westward , so far as we could see , blackness lay unbroken on the level earth .
we swooped down and skimmed low across the dark , throwing calls county by county .
now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of a <unk> , or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played across the fields , but northern illinois as a whole was one inky , apparently uninhabited , waste of high , forced woods .
only our illuminated map , with its little pointer switching from county to county as we wheeled and twisted , gave us any idea of our position .
our calls , urgent , pleading , coaxing or commanding , through the general <unk> brought no answer . '
illinois strictly maintained her own privacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose .
'oh , this is absurd ! '
said de forest .
'we 're like an owl trying to work a <unk> .
is this bureau creek ?
let 's land , arnott , and get hold of some one . '
we brushed over a belt of forced woodland  <unk> <name> sixty feet high  grounded on a private <unk> , none too big , where we moored to our own <unk> , and hurried out through the warm dark night towards a light in a verandah .
as we neared the garden gate i could have sworn we had stepped knee-deep in quicksand , for we could scarcely drag our feet against the <unk> currents that clogged them .
after five paces we stopped , wiping our foreheads , as hopelessly stuck on dry smooth turf as so many cows in a bog .
<unk> ! '
cried pirolo angrily .
'we are <unk> .
and it is my own system of <unk> too !
i know the pull . '
'good evening , ' said a girl 's voice from the verandah .
'oh , i 'm sorry !
we 've locked up .
wait a minute . '
we heard the click of a switch , and almost fell forward as the currents round our knees were withdrawn .
the girl laughed , and laid aside her knitting .
an old-fashioned <unk> stood at her elbow , which she reversed from time to time , and we could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile away , behind the guardian woods .
'come in and sit down , ' she said .
'i 'm only playing a plough .
<unk> gone to chicago to  ah !
then it was your call i heard just now ! '
she had caught sight of arnott 's board uniform , leaped to the switch , and turned it full on .
we were checked , gasping , <unk> in current this time , three yards from the verandah .
'we only want to know what 's the matter with illinois , ' said de forest placidly .
'then had n't you better go to chicago and find out ? '
she answered .
'there 's nothing wrong here .
we own ourselves . '
'how can we go anywhere if you wo n't loose us ? '
de forest went on , while arnott scowled .
admirals of fleets are still quite human when their dignity is touched .
'stop a minute  you do n't know how funny you look ! '
she put her hands on her hips and laughed mercilessly .
'do n't worry about that , ' said arnott , and whistled .
a voice answered from the <name> pirolo in the meadow .
'only a <unk> <unk> ! '
arnott called .
<unk> it out gently , please . '
we heard the <name> of a breaking lamp ; a fuse blew out somewhere in the verandah roof , frightening a <unk> of birds .
the <unk> was open .
we stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles .
'how rude  how very rude of you ! '
the maiden cried .
<unk> , but we have n't time to look funny , ' said arnott .
'we 've got to go to chicago ; and if i were you , young <name> , i 'd go into the cellars for the next two hours , and take mother with me . '
off he strode , with us at his heels , muttering indignantly , till the humour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot of the <unk> ladder .
'the board has n't shown what you might call a fat spark on this occasion , ' said de forest , wiping his eyes .
'i <name> i did n't look as big a fool as you did , arnott !
hullo !
what on earth is that ?
dad coming home from chicago ? '
there was a rattle and a rush , and a <unk> cultivator , blades in air like so many teeth , trundled itself at us round the edge of the timber , fuming and <unk> furiously .
<unk> ! '
said arnott , as we bundled ourselves through the <unk> door .
'never mind about shutting it .
up ! '
the <name> pirolo lifted like a bubble , and the vicious machine shot just underneath us , clawing high as it passed .
'there 's a nice little <unk> for you ! '
said arnott , dusting his knees .
'we ask her a civil question .
first she <unk> us and then she plays a cultivator at us ! '
'and then we fly , ' said dragomiroff .
'if i were forty years more young , i would go back and kiss her .
ho !
ho ! '
'i , ' said pirolo , 'would smack her !
my pet ship has been chased by a dirty plough ; a  how do you say ?  agricultural implement . '
'oh , that is illinois all over , ' said de forest .
'they do n't content themselves with talking about privacy .
they arrange to have it .
and now , where 's your alleged fleet , arnott ?
we must assert ourselves against this wench . '
arnott pointed to the black heavens .
<unk> on  up there , ' said he .
'shall i give them the whole installation , sir ? '
'oh , i do n't think the young <name> is quite worth that , ' said de forest .
'get over chicago , and perhaps we 'll see something . '
in a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong block of <unk> in the centre of the little town .
'that looks like the old city hall .
yes , there 's <unk> 's statue in front of it , ' said takahira .
'but what on earth are they doing to the place ?
i thought they used it for a market nowadays !
drop a little , please . '
we could hear the <unk> and crackle of <unk> machines  the cheap western type which fuse stone and rubbish into <unk> ribbed glass for their rough country roads .
three or four <unk> worked on each side of a square of ruins .
the brick and stone wreckage crumbled , slid forward , and presently spread out into white-hot pools of sticky slag , which the <unk> smoothed more or less flat .
already a third of the big block had been so treated , and was cooling to dull red before our astonished eyes .
'it is the old market , ' said de forest .
'well , there 's nothing to prevent illinois from making a road through a market .
it doesn't interfere with traffic , that i can see . '
<unk> ! '
said arnott , gripping me by the shoulder .
'listen !
they're singing .
why on the earth are they singing ? '
we dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the edge of that glowing square .
at first they only roared against the roar of the <unk> and <unk> .
then the words came up clearly  the words of the forbidden song that all men knew , and none let pass their lips  poor <name> <unk> 's song , made in the days of the crowds and the plague  every silly word of it loaded to <unk> with the planet 's inherited memories of horror , panic , fear and cruelty .
and chicago  innocent , contented little chicago  was singing it aloud to the infernal tune that carried riot , pestilence and lunacy round our planet a few generations ago !
'once there was the people  terror gave it birth ; once there was the people , and it made a hell of earth ! '
( then the stamp and pause ) : <unk> arose and crushed it .
listen , oh , ye slain !
once there was the people  it shall never be again ! '
the <unk> thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed itself again , again and again , louder than the crash of the melting walls .
de forest frowned .
'i do n't like that , ' he said .
'they 've broken back to the old days !
they 'll be killing somebody soon .
i think we 'd better divert 'em , arnott . '
'ay , ay , sir . '
arnott 's hand went to his cap , and we heard the hull of the <name> pirolo ring to the command : <unk> !
both watches stand by !
lamps !
lamps !
lamps ! '
'keep still ! '
takahira whispered to me .
<unk> , please , quartermaster . '
'it 's all right  all right ! '
said pirolo from behind , and to my horror slipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap .
i could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes , but i stood in absolute darkness .
'to save the sight , ' he explained , and pushed me on to the <unk> <unk> .
'you <name> see in a minute . '
as he spoke i became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light , let down from heaven at an immense distance  one vertical <unk> of frozen lightning .
'those are our <unk> ships , ' said arnott at my elbow .
'that one is over <unk> .
look south  that other one 's over <unk> .
vincennes is behind us , and north yonder is winthrop woods .
the fleet 's in position , sir '  this to de forest .
'as soon as you give the word . '
'ah no !
no ! '
cried dragomiroff at my side .
i could feel the old man tremble .
'i do not know all that you can do , but be kind !
i ask you to be a little kind to them below !
this is horrible  horrible ! '
'when a woman kills a chicken , <unk> and empires <unk> , ' takahira quoted .
'it is too late to be gentle now . '
'then take off my helmet !
take off my helmet ! '
dragomiroff began hysterically .
pirolo must have put his arm round him .
<unk> , ' he said , 'i am here .
it is all right , <name> , my dear fellow . '
'i 'll just send our little girl in bureau county a warning , ' said arnott .
'she do n't deserve it , but we 'll allow her a minute or two to take mamma to the cellar . '
in the utter hush that followed the growling spark after arnott had linked up his service <unk> with the invisible fleet , we heard <unk> 's song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to position .
then i clapped my hand before my mask lenses , for it was as though the floor of heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable blaze of suns in the making was poured through the <unk> .
'you need n't count , ' said arnott .
i had had no thought of such a thing .
'there are two hundred and fifty keels up there , five miles apart .
full power , please , for another twelve seconds . '
the firmament , as far as eye could reach , stood on pillars of white fire .
one fell on the glowing square at chicago , and turned it black .
'oh !
oh !
oh !
can men be allowed to do such things ? '
dragomiroff cried , and fell across our knees .
<unk> of water , please , ' said takahira to a <unk> shape that leaped forward .
'he is a little faint . '
the lights switched off , and the darkness stunned like an avalanche .
we could hear dragomiroff 's teeth on the glass edge .
pirolo was comforting him .
'all right , all <unk> , ' he repeated .
'come and lie down .
come below and take off your mask .
i give you my word , old friend , it is all right .
they are my <unk> .
little <name> pirolo 's leetle lights .
you know me !
i do not hurt people . '
<unk> ! '
dragomiroff moaned .
'i have never seen death .
i have never seen the board take action .
shall we go down and burn them alive , or is that already done ? '
'oh , hush , ' said pirolo , and i think he rocked him in his arms .
'do we repeat , sir ? '
arnott asked de forest .
'give 'em a minute 's break , ' de forest replied .
'they may need it . '
we waited a minute , and then <unk> 's song , broken but defiant , rose from <unk> chicago .
'they seem fond of that tune , ' said de forest .
'i should let 'em have it , arnott . '
'very good , sir , ' said arnott , and felt his way to the <unk> keys .
no lights broke forth , but the hollow of the skies made herself the mouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the <name> .
men hear such sounds in delirium , advancing like tides from horizons beyond the ruled <unk> of space .
'that 's our <unk> , ' said arnott .
'we may be a bit ragged .
i've never conducted two hundred and fifty performers before . '
he pulled out the <unk> , and struck a full chord on the service <unk> .
the beams of light leaped down again , and danced , solemnly and awfully , a <unk> , sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each <unk> kick , while the darkness delivered itself  there is no scale to measure against that utterance  of the tune to which they kept time .
certain notes  one learnt to expect them with terror  cut through one 's marrow , but , after three minutes , thought and emotion passed in indescribable agony .
we saw , we heard , but i think we were in some sort <unk> .
the two hundred and fifty beams shifted , <unk> , <unk> and split , narrowed , widened , rippled in ribbons , broke into a thousand white-hot parallel lines , melted and revolved in <unk> rings like old-fashioned <unk> , flung up to the zenith , made as if to descend and renew the torment , halted at the last instant , <unk> <unk> round the horizon , and vanished , to bring back for the hundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed light over all illinois .
then the tune and lights ceased together , and we heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a rubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl .
'ah , that is my new siren , ' said pirolo .
'you can break an iceberg in half , if you find the proper pitch .
they <name> whistle by squadrons now .
it is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows . '
i had collapsed beside dragomiroff , broken and <unk> feebly , because i had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of judgment day , and the archangels of the resurrection were hailing me naked across the universe to the sound of the music of the spheres .
then i saw de forest smacking arnott 's helmet with his open hand .
the wailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us , and returned to her place above the lower clouds .
'i hate to interrupt a specialist when he 's enjoying himself , ' said de forest .
'but , as a matter of fact , all illinois has been asking us to stop for these last fifteen seconds . '
'what a pity . '
arnott slipped off his mask .
'i wanted you to hear us really hum .
our lower c can lift <unk> . '
'it is hell  hell ! '
cried dragomiroff , and sobbed aloud .
arnott looked away as he answered : 'it 's a few thousand <unk> ahead of the old <unk> game , but i should scarcely call it that .
what shall i tell the fleet , sir ? '
'tell 'em we 're very pleased and impressed .
i do n't think they need wait on any longer .
there is n't a spark left down there . '
de forest pointed .
'they 'll be deaf and blind . '
'oh , i think not , sir .
the demonstration lasted less than ten minutes . '
<unk> ! '
takahira sighed .
'i should have said it was half a night .
now , shall we go down and pick up the pieces ? '
'but first a small drink , ' said pirolo .
'the board must not arrive weeping at its own works . '
'i am an old fool  an old fool ! '
dragomiroff began piteously .
'i did not know what would happen .
it is all new to me .
we reason with them in little russia . '
chicago north <unk> was unlighted , and arnott worked his ship into the <unk> by her own lights .
as soon as these broke out we heard <unk> of horror and appeal from many people below .
'all right , ' shouted arnott into the darkness .
'we are n't beginning again ! '
we descended by the stairs , to find ourselves knee-deep in a <unk> crowd , some crying that they were blind , others beseeching us not to make any more noises , but the greater part writhing face downward , their hands or their caps before their eyes .
it was pirolo who came to our rescue .
he climbed the side of a <unk> , and there , gesticulating as though they could see , made oration to those afflicted people of illinois .
'you <unk> ! '
he began .
'there is nothing to fuss for .
of course , your eyes <name> smart and be red to-morrow .
you <name> look as if you and your wives had drunk too much , but in a little while you <name> see again as well as before .
i tell you this , and i  i am pirolo .
<name> pirolo ! '
the crowd with one accord shuddered , for many legends attach to <name> pirolo of <unk> , deep in the secrets of god .
<unk> ? '
an unsteady voice lifted itself .
'then tell us was there anything except light in those lights of yours just now ? '
the question was repeated from every corner of the darkness .
pirolo laughed .
'no ! '
he thundered .
( why have small men such large voices ? )
'i give you my word and the board 's word that there was nothing except light  just light !
you <unk> !
your <unk> is too low already as it is .
some day i must invent something to send it up , but send it down  never ! '
'is that true ?  we thought  somebody said  ' one could feel the tension relax all round .
'you too big fools , ' pirolo cried .
'you could have sent us a call and we would have told you . '
<unk> you a call ! '
a deep voice shouted .
'i wish you had been at our end of the wire . '
'i 'm glad i was n't , ' said de forest .
'it was bad enough from behind the lamps .
never mind !
it 's over now .
is there any one here i can talk business with ?
i 'm de forest  for the board . '
'you might begin with me , for one  i 'm mayor , ' the bass voice replied .
a big man rose unsteadily from the street , and staggered towards us where we sat on the broad <unk> , in front of the garden fences .
'i ought to be the first on my feet .
am i ? '
said he .
'yes , ' said de forest , and steadied him as he dropped down beside us .
<unk> , <name> .
is that you ? '
a voice called .
<unk> me , ' said the mayor ; 'that sounds like my chief of police , <unk> ! '
<unk> it is ; and here 's <unk> and <unk>  on their feet . '
<unk> 'em up please , <unk> .
we 're supposed to be the four in charge of this hamlet .
what we says , goes .
and , de forest , what do you say ? '
'nothing  yet , ' de forest answered , as we made room for the panting , reeling men .
<unk> cut out of system .
well ? '
'tell the steward to send down drinks , please , ' arnott whispered to an orderly at his side .
'good ! '
said the mayor , smacking his dry lips .
'now i suppose we can take it , de forest , that henceforward the board <name> administer us direct ? '
'not if the board can avoid it , ' de forest laughed .
'the <unk> .
is responsible for the <unk> traffic only . '
<unk> all that that implies . '
the big four who ran chicago chanted their magna <unk> like children at school .
'well , get on , ' said de forest wearily .
'what is your silly trouble anyway ? '
'too much dam ' democracy , ' said the mayor , laying his hand on de forest 's knee .
'so ?
i thought illinois had had her dose of that . '
'she has .
that 's why .
<unk> , what did you do with our prisoners last night ? '
<unk> 'em in the <unk> to prevent the women killing 'em , ' the chief of police replied .
'i 'm too blind to move just yet , but  ' <unk> , send some of your people , please , and fetch 'em along , ' said de forest .
'they 're <unk> , ' the mayor called .
'you 'll have to blow out three fuses . '
he turned to de forest , his large outline just visible in the paling darkness .
'i hate to throw any more work on the board .
i 'm an administrator myself , but we 've had a little fuss with our serviles .
what ?
in a big city there 's bound to be a few men and women who can't live without listening to themselves , and who prefer drinking out of pipes they do n't own both ends of .
they inhabit flats and hotels all the year round .
they say it saves 'em trouble .
anyway , it gives 'em more time to make trouble for their neighbours .
we call 'em serviles locally .
and they are apt to be <unk> . '
'just so ! '
said the man called <unk> .
transportation is civilisation .
democracy is disease .
i 've proved it by the <unk> , every time . '
<unk> 's our health officer , and a <unk> man , ' said the mayor , laughing .
'but it 's true that most serviles have n't much control .
they <name> talk ; and when people take to talking as a business , anything may arrive  may n't it , de forest ? '
<unk>  except the facts of the case , ' said de forest , laughing .
'i 'll give you those in a minute , ' said the mayor .
'our serviles got to talking  first in their houses and then on the streets , telling men and women how to manage their own affairs .
( you ca n't teach a servile not to finger his neighbour 's soul . )
that 's invasion of privacy , of course , but in chicago we 'll suffer anything sooner than make crowds .
nobody took much notice , and so i let 'em alone .
my fault !
i was warned there would be trouble , but there has n't been a crowd or murder in illinois for nineteen years . '
<unk> , ' said his chief of police .
<unk> .
anyway , we 'd forgot such things .
so , from talking in the houses and on the streets , our serviles go to calling a meeting at the old market yonder . '
he nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings heaved up grey in the <unk> behind the <unk> statue of the negro in flames .
'there 's nothing to prevent any one calling meetings except that it 's against human nature to stand in a crowd , besides being bad for the health .
i ought to have known by the way our men and women attended that first meeting that trouble was brewing .
there were as many as a thousand in the market-place , touching each other .
touching !
then the serviles turned in all <unk> and talked , and we  ' 'what did they talk about ? '
said takahira .
'first , how badly things were managed in the city .
that pleased us four  we were on the platform  because we hoped to catch one or two good men for city work .
you know how rare executive capacity is .
even if we did n't it 's  it 's refreshing to find any one interested enough in our job to damn our eyes .
you do n't know what it means to work , year in , year out , without a spark of difference with a living soul . '
'oh , do n't we ! '
said de forest .
'there are times on the board when we'd give our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things themselves . '
'but they wo n't , ' said the mayor ruefully .
'i assure you , sir , we four have done things in chicago , in the <name> of rousing people , that would have discredited nero .
but what do they say ?
" very good , <name> .
have it your own way .
anything 's better than a crowd .
i 'll go back to my land . "
you can't do anything with folk who can go where they please , and do n't want anything on god 's earth except their own way .
there is n't a kick or a <unk> left on the planet . '
'then i suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself ? '
said de forest .
we could see the bare and still smoking ruins , and hear the <unk> crackle as they hardened and set .
'oh , that 's only amusement .
'tell you later .
as i was saying , our serviles held the meeting , and pretty soon we had to <unk> the platform to save 'em from being killed .
and that did n't make our people any more pacific . '
'how d'you mean ? '
i ventured to ask .
'if you 've ever been <unk> , ' said the mayor , 'you 'll know it do n't improve any man 's temper to be held up straining against nothing .
no , sir !
eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies in <unk> for two hours , while a pack of perfectly safe serviles <unk> their mental and spiritual privacy , may be amusing to watch , but they are not pleasant to handle afterwards . '
pirolo chuckled .
'our folk own themselves .
they were of opinion things were going too far and too fiery .
i warned the serviles ; but they 're born <unk> .
unless a fact hits 'em on the head they can not see it .
would you believe me , they went on to talk of what they called " popular government " ?
they did !
they wanted us to go back to the old <unk> of voting with papers and wooden boxes , and <unk> people and printed <unk> , and <unk> !
they said they practised it among themselves about what they 'd have to eat in their flats and hotels .
yes , sir !
they stood up behind <unk> 's doubled <unk> , and they said that , in this present year of <name> , to <unk> men and women , on that very spot !
then they finished '  he lowered his voice cautiously  'by talking about " the people . "
and then <unk> he had to sit up all night in charge of the <unk> because he could n't trust his men to keep 'em shut . '
'it was trying 'em too high , ' the chief of police broke in .
'but we could n't hold the crowd <unk> for ever .
i gathered in all the serviles on charge of <unk> , and put 'em in the <unk> , and then i let things cut loose .
i had to !
the district lit like a <unk> <unk> ! '
'the news was out over seven degrees of country , ' the mayor continued ; 'and when once it 's a question of invasion of privacy , good-bye to right and reason in illinois !
they began turning out <unk> and locking up <unk> on thursday night .
friday , they stopped all traffic and asked for the board to take over .
then they wanted to clean chicago off the side of the lake and rebuild elsewhere  just for a souvenir of " the people " that the serviles talked about .
i suggested that they should slag the old market where the meeting was held , while i turned in a call to you all on the board .
that kept 'em quiet till you came along .
and  and now you can take hold of the situation . '
'any chance of their <unk> down ? '
de forest asked .
'you can try , ' said the mayor .
de forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving crowd that had edged in towards us .
day was come .
'do n't you think this business can be arranged ? '
he began .
but there was a roar of angry voices : 'we 've finished with crowds !
we are n't going back to the old days !
take us over !
take the serviles away !
administer direct or we 'll kill 'em !
down with the people ! '
an attempt was made to begin <unk> 's song .
it got no further than the first line , for the <name> pirolo sent down a warning drone on one stopped horn .
a wrecked <unk> of the old market tottered and fell inwards on the <unk> .
none spoke or moved till the last of the dust had settled down again , turning the steel case of salad 's statue ashy grey .
'you see you 'll just have to take us over , ' the mayor whispered .
de forest shrugged his shoulders .
'you talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like so much <unk> .
ca n't you manage yourselves on any terms ? '
he said .
'we can , if you say so .
it <name> only cost those few lives to begin with , ' the mayor pointed across the square , where arnott 's men guided a stumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and halted them under the statue .
'now i think , ' said takahira under his breath , 'there <name> be trouble . '
the mass in front of us growled like beasts .
at that moment the sun rose clear , and revealed the blinking assembly to itself .
as soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of horror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the <unk> flaws shot across the lake outside .
nothing was said , and , being half blind , of course it moved slowly .
yet in less than fifteen minutes most of that vast multitude  three thousand at the lowest count  melted away like frost on south eaves .
the remnant stretched themselves on the grass , where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd .
'these mean business , ' the mayor whispered to takahira .
'there are a <unk> few women there who 've borne children .
i do n't like it . '
the morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise of a hot day ; the sun reflected itself <unk> on the <unk> covering of <unk> 's statue ; cocks crew in the gardens , and we could hear <unk> clicking in the distance as people <unk> <unk> their homes .
'i 'm afraid there wo n't be any morning <unk> , ' said de forest .
'we rather upset things in the country last night . '
'that makes no odds , ' the mayor returned .
'we 're all <unk> for six months .
we take no chances . '
nor , when you come to think of it , does any one else .
it must be three-quarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food <unk> .
yet is there house or city on the planet to-day that has not half a year 's provisions laid in ?
we are like the shipwrecked seamen in the old books , who , having once nearly starved to death , ever afterwards hide away bits of food and biscuit .
truly we trust no crowds , nor system based on crowds !
de forest waited till the last footstep had died away .
meantime the prisoners at the base of the statue shuffled , <unk> , and fidgeted , with the <unk> of quite little children .
none of them were more than six feet high , and many of them were as <unk> as the ravaged , harassed heads of old pictures .
they huddled together in actual touch , while the crowd , <unk> at large intervals , looked at them with <unk> eyes .
suddenly a man among them began to talk .
the mayor had not in the least exaggerated .
it appeared that our planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the heel of the <unk> board of control .
the orator urged us to arise in our might , burst our prison doors and break our fetters ( all his metaphors , by the way , were of the most <unk> ) .
next he demanded that every matter of daily life , including most of the physical functions , should be submitted for decision at any time of the week , month , or year to , i gathered , anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a certain radius , and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns to settle the matter , first by <unk> , next by talking to the crowds made , and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper , which rubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and oaths .
out of this amazing play , he assured us , would automatically arise a higher , nobler , and kinder world , based  he demonstrated this with the awful <unk> of the insane  based on the sanctity of the crowd and the villainy of the single person .
in conclusion , he called loudly upon god to testify to his personal merits and integrity .
when the flow ceased , i turned bewildered to takahira , who was nodding solemnly .
<unk> correct , ' said he .
'it is all in the old books .
he has left nothing out , not even the <unk> . '
'but i do n't see how this stuff can upset a child , much less a district , ' i replied .
'ah , you are too young , ' said dragomiroff .
'for another thing , you are not a mamma .
please look at the <unk> . '
ten or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the silent men , and were drawing in towards the prisoners .
it reminded one of the stealthy encircling , before the rush in at the quarry , of wolves round <unk> in the north .
the prisoners saw , and <name> together more closely .
the mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant .
de forest , bareheaded , stepped forward between the prisoners , and the slowly , stiffly moving line .
'that 's all very interesting , ' he said to the <unk> orator .
'but the point seems that you 've been making crowds and invading privacy . '
a woman stepped forward , and would have spoken , but there was a quick <unk> murmur from the men , who realised that de forest was trying to pull the situation down to <unk> .
'yes !
yes ! '
they cried .
'we cut out because they made crowds and invaded privacy !
stick to that !
keep on that switch !
lift the serviles out of this !
the board 's in charge !
hsh ! '
'yes , the board 's in charge , ' said de forest .
'i 'll take formal evidence of <unk> if you like , but the members of the board can testify to it .
<name> that do ? '
the women had closed in another pace , with hands that clenched and <unk> at their sides .
'good !
good enough ! '
the men cried .
'we 're content .
only take them away quickly . '
'come along up ! '
said de forest to the captives , <unk> is quite ready . '
it appeared , however , that they did not wish to go .
they intended to remain in chicago and make crowds .
they pointed out that de <unk> proposal was gross invasion of privacy .
'my dear fellow , ' said pirolo to the most <unk> of the leaders , 'you hurry , or your crowd that ca n't be wrong <name> kill you ! '
'but that would be murder , ' answered the believer in crowds ; and there was a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis had broken .
a woman stepped forward from the line of women , laughing , i protest , as merrily as any of the company .
one hand , of course , shaded her eyes , the other was at her throat .
'oh , they need n't be afraid of being killed ! '
she called .
'not in the least , ' said de forest .
'but do n't you think that , now the board 's in charge , you might go home while we get these people away ? '
'i shall be home long before that .
it  it has been rather a trying day . '
she stood up to her full height , <unk> even de <unk> <unk> , and smiled , with eyes closed against the fierce light .
'yes , rather , ' said de forest .
'i 'm afraid you feel the glare a little .
we 'll have the ship down . '
he motioned to the pirolo to drop between us and the sun , and at the same time to <unk> the prisoners , who were a trifle unsteady .
we saw them stiffen to the current where they stood .
the woman 's voice went on , sweet and deep and unshaken : 'i do n't suppose you men realise how much this  this sort of thing means to a woman .
i 've borne three .
we women do n't want our children given to crowds .
it must be an inherited instinct .
crowds make trouble .
they bring back the old days .
hate , fear , blackmail , publicity , " the people "  that !
that !
that ! '
she pointed to the statue , and the crowd growled once more .
'yes , if they are allowed to go on , ' said de forest .
'but this little affair  ' 'it means so much to us women that this  this little affair should never happen again .
of course , never 's a big word , but one feels so strongly that it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning .
those creatures '  she pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like seaweed in a <unk> as the circuit pulled them  'those people have friends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere .
one doesn't want anything done to them , you know .
it 's terrible to force a human being out of fifty or sixty years of good life .
i 'm only forty myself .
i know .
but , at the same time , one feels that an example should be made , because no price is too heavy to pay if  if these people and all that they imply can be put an end to .
do you quite understand , or would you be kind enough to tell your men to take the <unk> off the statue ?
it 's worth looking at . '
'i understand perfectly .
but i do n't think anybody here wants to see the statue on an empty stomach .
excuse me one moment . '
de forest called up to the ship , 'a flying loop ready on the port side , if you please . '
then to the woman he said with some <unk> , 'you might leave us a little discretion in the matter . '
'oh , of course .
thank you for being so patient .
i know my arguments are silly , but  ' she half turned away and went on in a changed voice , 'perhaps this <name> help you to decide . '
she threw out her right arm with a knife in it .
before the blade could be returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip , <unk> as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above , and fell flashing in the <name> at the foot of the statue fifty yards away .
the <unk> arm was arrested , rigid as a bar for an instant , till the releasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side .
the other women shrank back silent among the men .
pirolo rubbed his hands , and takahira nodded .
'that was clever of you , de forest , ' said he .
'what a glorious pose ! '
dragomiroff murmured , for the frightened woman was on the edge of tears .
'why did you stop me ?
i would have done it ! '
she cried .
'i have no doubt you would , ' said de forest .
'but we ca n't waste a life like yours on these people .
i <name> the arrest did n't sprain your wrist ; it 's so hard to regulate a flying loop .
but i think you are quite right about those persons ' women and children .
we 'll take them all away with us if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself . '
'i promise  i promise . '
she controlled herself with an effort .
'but it is so important to us women .
we know what it means ; and i thought if you saw i was in <name>  ' 'i saw you were , and you 've gained your point .
i shall take all your serviles away with me at once .
the mayor <name> make lists of their friends and families in the city and the district , and he 'll ship them after us this afternoon . '
'sure , ' said the mayor , rising to his feet .
<unk> , if you can see , had n't you better finish <unk> off the old market ?
it do n't look <unk> the way it is now , and we <name> n't use it for crowds any more . '
'i think you had better wipe out that statue as well , mr. mayor , ' said de forest .
'i do n't question its merits as a work of <name> , but i believe it 's a shade morbid . '
'certainly , sir .
oh , <unk> !
slag the nigger before you go on to fuse the market .
i 'll get to the <unk> and tell the district that the board is in charge .
are you making any special appointments , sir ? '
'none .
we have n't men to waste on these <unk> .
<name> on as before , but under the board .
arnott , run your serviles aboard , please .
ground ship and pass them through the <unk> .
we 'll wait till we've finished with this work of <name> . '
the prisoners trailed past him , talking fluently , but unable to <unk> in the drag of the current .
then the <unk> rolled up , two on each side of the statue .
with one accord the spectators looked elsewhere , but there was no need .
<unk> turned on full power , and the thing simply melted within its case .
all i saw was a surge of white-hot metal pouring over the <unk> , a glimpse of salad 's inscription , 'to the eternal memory of the justice of the people , ' ere the stone base itself cracked and powdered into finest lime .
the crowd cheered .
'thank you , ' said de forest ; 'but we want our <unk> , and i expect you do too .
good-bye , mr. mayor !
delighted to see you at any time , but i <name> i <name> n't have to , officially , for the next thirty years .
good-bye , madam .
yes .
we 're all given to nerves nowadays .
i suffer from them myself .
good-bye , gentlemen all !
you 're under the <unk> heel of the board from this moment , but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters you 've only to let us know .
this is no treat to us .
good luck ! '
we embarked amid shouts , and did not check our lift till they had dwindled into whispers .
then de forest flung himself on the <unk> <unk> and mopped his forehead .
'i do n't mind men , ' he panted , 'but women are the devil ! '
<unk> the devil , ' said pirolo cheerfully .
'that one would have <unk> . '
'i know it .
that was why i signalled for the flying loop to be clapped on her .
i owe you an apology for that , arnott .
i had n't time to catch your eye , and you were busy with our <unk> .
by the way , who actually answered my signal ?
it was a smart piece of work . '
<unk> , ' said arnott ; 'but he <unk> the wave .
it may be pretty <unk> to knock a knife out of a <name> 's hand , but did n't you notice how she rubbed 'em ?
he scorched her fingers .
slovenly , i call it . '
<unk> be it from me to interfere with fleet discipline , but do n't be too hard on the boy .
if that woman had killed herself they would have killed every servile and everything related to a servile throughout the district by nightfall . '
'that was what she was playing for , ' takahira said .
'and with our fleet gone we could have done nothing to hold them . '
'i may be ass enough to walk into a <unk> , ' said arnott , 'but i do n't dismiss my fleet till i 'm reasonably sure that trouble is over .
they 're in position still , and i intend to keep 'em there till the serviles are shipped out of the district .
that last little crowd meant murder , my friends . '
<unk> !
all nerves ! '
said pirolo .
'you can not argue with <unk> . '
'and it is not as if they had seen much dead  or is it ? '
said takahira .
'in all my ninety years i have never seen death . '
dragomiroff spoke as one who would excuse himself .
'perhaps that was why  last night  ' then it came out as we sat over breakfast , that , with the exception of arnott and pirolo , none of us had ever seen a corpse , or knew in what manner the spirit passes .
'we 're a nice lot to flap about governing the planet , ' de forest laughed .
'i confess , now it 's all over , that my main fear was i <unk> be able to pull it off without losing a life . '
'i thought of that too , ' said arnott ; 'but there 's no death reported , and i 've inquired everywhere .
what are we supposed to do with our passengers ?
i 've fed 'em . '
'we 're between two <unk> , ' de forest drawled .
'if we drop them in any place that is n't under the board the natives <name> make their presence an excuse for cutting out , same as illinois did , and forcing the board to take over .
if we drop them in any place under the board 's control they 'll be killed as soon as our backs are turned . '
'if you say so , ' said pirolo thoughtfully , 'i can guarantee that they <name> become extinct in process of time , quite happily .
what is their <unk> now ? '
'go down and ask 'em , ' said de forest .
'i think they might become nervous and tear me to bits , ' the philosopher of <unk> replied .
'not really ?
well ? '
<unk> the <unk> , ' said takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb .
<unk>  after all the trouble we 've taken to save 'em , ' said de forest .
<unk> london , ' arnott suggested .
'you could turn satan himself loose there , and they 'd only ask him to dinner . '
'good man !
you 've given me an idea .
<name> !
oh , <name> ! '
he threw the general <unk> open so that we could all hear , and in a few minutes the <unk> filled with the <name> , <unk> voice of leopold <name> , who has <unk> all london her choicest amusements for the last thirty years .
we answered with expectant grins , as though we were actually in the stalls of , say , the combination on a first night .
'we 've picked up something in your line , ' de forest began .
'that 's good , dear man .
if it 's old enough .
there 's nothing to beat the old things for business purposes .
have you seen london , chatham , and dover at <name> 's court ?
no ?
i thought i missed you there .
immense !
i've had the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the iron rails cast specially by hand .
cloth cushions in the carriages , too !
immense !
and paper railway tickets .
and <name> <name> . '
<unk> <name> back again ! '
said arnott rapturously .
<unk> me two stalls for to-morrow night .
what 's she singing now , bless her ? '
'the old songs .
nothing comes up to the old touch .
listen to this , dear men . '
<name> <unk> with flourishes : oh , cruel lamps of london , if tears your light could drown , your victims ' eyes would weep them , oh , lights of london town !
'then they weep . '
'you see ? '
pirolo waved his hands at us .
'the old world always <unk> when it saw crowds together .
it did not know why , but it <unk> .
we know why , but we do not weep , except when we pay to be made to by fat , wicked old <name> . '
'old , yourself ! '
<name> laughed .
'i 'm a public benefactor , i keep the world soft and united . '
'and i 'm de forest of the board , ' said de forest <unk> , <unk> to get a little business done .
as i was saying , i 've picked up a few people in chicago . '
'i cut out .
chicago is  ' 'do listen !
they 're perfectly unique . '
'do they build houses of baked <unk> while you wait  eh ?
that 's an old contact . '
'they 're an untouched primitive community , with all the old ideas . '
<unk> and <unk> ?
cooking on <unk> stoves , lighting pipes with matches , and driving horses ?
<unk> tried that last year .
an absolute blow-out ! '
de forest plugged him wrathfully , and poured out the story of our doings for the last twenty-four hours on the <unk> .
'and they do it all in public , ' he concluded .
'you ca n't stop 'em .
the more public , the better they are pleased .
they 'll talk for hours  like you !
now you can come in again ! '
'do you really mean they know how to vote ? '
said <name> .
'can they act it ? '
<unk> ?
it 's their life to 'em !
and you never saw such faces !
scarred like volcanoes .
envy , hatred , and malice in plain sight .
wonderfully flexible voices .
they weep , too . '
<unk> ?
in public ? '
'i guarantee .
not a spark of shame or <unk> in the entire installation .
it 's the chance of your career . '
'd'you say you 've brought their voting props along  those papers and <unk> things ? '
'no , confound you !
i 'm not a <unk> .
apply direct to the mayor of chicago .
he 'll forward you everything .
well ? '
'wait a minute .
did chicago want to kill 'em ?
that 'ud look well on the <unk> . '
'yes !
they were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mob  if you know what that is . '
'but i do n't , ' answered the great <name> simply .
'well then , they 'll tell you themselves .
they can make speeches hours long . '
'how many are there ? '
'by the time we ship 'em all over they 'll be perhaps a hundred , counting children .
an old world in miniature .
ca n't you see it ? '
<unk> ; but i 've got to pay for it if it 's a blow-out , dear man . '
'they can sing the old war songs in the streets .
they can get <unk> , and make crowds , and invade privacy in the genuine old-fashioned way ; and they 'll do the voting trick as often as you ask 'em a question . '
'too good ! '
said <name> .
'you <unk> jew !
i 've got a dozen head aboard here .
i 'll put you through direct .
sample 'em yourself . '
he lifted the switch and we listened .
our passengers on the lower deck at once , but not less than five at a time , explained themselves to <name> .
they had been taken from the bosom of their families , stripped of their possessions , given food without <unk> , and cast into captivity in a <unk> dungeon .
'but look here , ' said arnott aghast ; 'they 're saying what is n't true .
my lower deck is n't <unk> , and i saw to the <unk> myself . '
'my people talk like that sometimes in little russia , ' said dragomiroff .
'we reason with them .
we never kill .
no ! '
'but it 's not true , ' arnott insisted .
'what can you do with people who do n't tell facts ?
they 're mad ! '
<unk> ! '
said pirolo , his hand to his ear .
'it is such a little time since all the planet told lies . '
we heard <name> <unk> sympathetic .
would they , he asked , repeat their assertions in public  before a vast public ?
only let <name> give them a chance , and the planet , they vowed , should ring with their wrongs .
their aim in life  two women and a man explained it together  was to reform the world .
oddly enough , this also had been <name> 's <unk> .
he offered them an arena in which to explain , and by their living example to raise the planet to loftier levels .
he was eloquent on the moral uplift of a simple , <unk> life presented in its <unk> to a <unk> civilisation .
could they  would they  for three months certain , devote themselves under his auspices , as missionaries , to the elevation of mankind at a place called <name> 's court , which he said , with some truth , was one of the intellectual centres of the planet ?
they thanked him , and demanded ( we could hear his chuckle of delight ) time to discuss and to vote on the matter .
the vote , solemnly managed by counting heads  one head , one vote  was favourable .
his offer , therefore , was accepted , and they moved a vote of thanks to him in two speeches  one by what they called the <unk> ' and the other by the <unk> . '
<name> threw over to us , his voice shaking with gratitude : 'i 've got 'em !
did you hear those speeches ?
that 's nature , dear men .
<name> ca n't teach <unk> and they voted as easily as lying .
i 've never had a <unk> of natural liars before .
bless you , dear men !
remember , you 're on my free lists for ever , anywhere  all of you .
oh , <unk> <name> be sick  sick ! '
'then you think they 'll do ? '
said de forest .
'do ?
the little village 'll go crazy !
i 'll knock up a series of <unk> plays for 'em .
their voices <name> make you laugh and cry .
my god , dear men , where do you suppose they picked up all their misery from , on this sweet earth ?
i 'll have a pageant of the world 's beginnings , and <unk> shall do the music .
i 'll  ' 'go and knock up a village for 'em by to-night .
we 'll meet you at no .
15 west landing tower , ' said de forest .
'remember the rest <name> be coming along to-morrow . '
'let 'em all come ! '
said <name> .
'you do n't know how hard it is nowadays even for me , to find something that really gets under the public 's damned <unk> hide .
but i 've got it at last .
good-bye ! '
'well , ' said de forest when we had finished laughing , 'if any one understood corruption in london i might have played off <name> against <unk> , and sold my captives at enormous prices .
as it is , i shall have to be their legal adviser to-night when the contracts are signed .
and they wo n't exactly press any commission on me , either . '
<unk> , ' said takahira , 'we can not , of course , confine members of leopold <name> 's <unk> company .
chairs for the ladies , please , arnott . '
'then i go to bed , ' said de forest .
'i ca n't face any more women ! '
and he vanished .
when our passengers were released and given another meal ( <unk> came first this time ) they told us what they thought of us and the board ; and , like <name> , we all marvelled how they had contrived to extract and secrete so much bitter poison and unrest out of the good life god gives us .
they raged , they stormed , they <unk> , flushed and exhausted their poor , torn nerves , panted themselves into silence , and renewed the senseless , shameless attacks .
'but ca n't you understand , ' said pirolo pathetically to a shrieking woman , 'that if we 'd left you in chicago you 'd have been killed ? '
'no , we should n't .
you were bound to save us from being murdered . '
'then we should have had to kill a lot of other people . '
'that does n't matter .
we were preaching the truth .
you ca n't stop us .
we shall go on preaching in london ; and then you 'll see ! '
'you can see now , ' said pirolo , and opened a lower shutter .
we were closing on the little village , with her three million people spread out at ease inside her ring of <unk> <unk> lights  those eight fixed beams at chatham , <unk> , <unk> , dorking , <unk> , st. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
leopold <name> 's new company looked , with small pale faces , at the silence , the size , and the separated houses .
then some began to weep aloud , shamelessly  always without shame .
<unk> 's song whether the state can loose and bind in heaven as well as on earth : if it be wiser to kill mankind before or after the birth  these are matters of high concern where <unk> <unk> are ; but holy state ( we have lived to learn ) <unk> in holy war .
whether the people be led by the lord , or lured by the loudest throat : if it be quicker to die by the sword or cheaper to die by vote  these are the things we have dealt with once , ( and they <name> not rise from their grave ) for holy people , however it runs , <unk> in wholly slave .
whatsoever , for any cause , <unk> to take or give , power above or beyond the laws , suffer it not to live !
holy state or holy king  or holy people 's <name>  have no truck with the senseless thing .
order the guns and kill !
saying  after  me :   once there was the people  terror gave it birth ; once there was the people and it made a hell of earth .
earth arose and crushed it .
listen , o ye slain !
once there was the people  it shall never be again !  friendly <name> ( march 1914 ) the valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a <unk> length across a field .
every blade , twig , <unk> , and <unk> carried water , and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches and <unk> , all delivering to the <name> below .
a week 's november rain on <unk> land had gorged her to full flood , and she proclaimed it aloud .
two men in sackcloth aprons were considering an <unk> hedge that ran down the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those <unk> .
they stood back and took stock of the neglected growth , tapped an elbow of <unk> here , a <unk> <unk> there , swayed a <unk> ash back and forth , and looked at each other .
'i reckon she 's about two <name> thick , ' said jabez the younger , 'an ' she has n't felt iron since  when has she , <name> ? '
'call it twenty-five year , jabez , an ' you wo n't be far out . '
<unk> ! '
jabez rubbed his wet <unk> on his <unk> <unk> .
'she ai n't a hedge .
she 's all manner o ' trees .
we 'll just about have to  ' he paused , as professional etiquette required .
'just about have to side her up an ' see what she 'll bear .
but had n't we best  ? '
<name> paused in his turn , both men being artists and equals .
'get some kind o ' line to go by . '
jabez ranged up and down till he found a thinner place , and with clean <unk> of the <unk> revealed the original face of the fence .
<name> took over the dripping stuff as it fell forward , and , with a grasp and a kick , made it to lie orderly on the bank till it should be <unk> .
by noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a <unk> barrier , tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred <name> which no woodman touches without orders .
'now we 've a <unk> to go by ! '
said <name> at last .
'she wo n't be as easy as this all along , ' jabez answered .
'she 'll need plenty stakes and <unk> when we come to the <name> . '
'well , ai n't we plenty ? '
<name> pointed to the ragged perspective ahead of them that plunged downhill into the fog .
'i lay there 's a cord an ' a half o ' firewood , let alone <unk> , 'fore we get anywheres <unk> the <name> . '
'the <name> 's got up a piece since morning , ' said jabez .
<unk> <unk> if she was over <unk> 's <unk> . '
<name> listened , too .
there was a growl in the <name> 's roar as though she worried something hard .
'yes .
she 's over <unk> 's <unk> , ' he replied .
'now she 'll flood acrost <unk> bay an ' that 'll ease her . '
'she wo n't ease <name> <unk> 's hay none if she do , ' jabez grunted .
'i told <name> he 'd set that liddle <unk> o ' his too low down in the <unk> .
i told him so when he was <unk> ' the bottom for it . '
'i told him so , too , ' said <name> .
'i told him 'fore ever you did .
i told him when the county council tarred the roads up along . '
he pointed uphill , where unseen automobiles and <unk> <unk> past continually .
'a tarred road , she shoots every drop o ' water into a valley same 's a slate roof .
't is n't as 't was in the old days , when the waters soaked in and soaked out in the way o ' nature .
it <unk> off they tarred roads all of a lump , and naturally every drop is bound to descend into the valley .
and there 's tar roads both two sides this valley for ten mile .
that 's what i told <name> <unk> when they tarred the roads last year .
but he 's a <unk> .
he do n't hardly ever journey uphill . '
'what did he say when you told him that ? '
jabez demanded , with a little change of voice .
'why ?
what did he say to you when you told him ? '
was the answer .
'what he said to you , i reckon , <name> . '
'then , you do n't need me to say it over again , jabez . '
'well , let be how 'twill , what was he gettin ' after when he said what he said to me ? '
jabez insisted .
'i dunno ; unless you tell me what manner o ' words he said to you . '
jabez <name> back from the hedge  all hedges are nests of treachery and <unk>  and moved to an open <unk> in the centre of the field .
'no need to go <unk> ' around , ' said <name> .
'none ca n't see us here 'fore we see them . '
'what was <name> <unk> gettin ' at when i said he 'd set his stack too near <unk> the <name> ? '
jabez dropped his voice .
'he was in his mind . '
'he ai n't never been out of it yet to my knowledge , ' <name> drawled , and <unk> his <unk> .
'but then <name> says : " i ai n't goin ' to shift my stack a yard , " he says .
" the <name> 's been good friends to me , and if she be minded , " he says , " to take a snatch at my hay , i ai n't settin ' out to withstand her . "
that 's what <name> <unk> says to me last  last <unk> 't was , ' said jabez .
<unk> he has n't shifted his stack , neither , ' <name> replied .
'an ' if there 's more rain , the <name> she 'll shift it for him . '
'no need tell me !
but i want to know what <name> was gettin ' at ? '
jabez opened his <unk> very deliberately ; <name> as carefully opened his .
they unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners , coiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages , and sat down on the edge of the lodge manger .
the rain began to fall again through the fog , and the <name> 's voice rose .
* * * * * 'but i always allowed <name> was his lawful child , like , ' said jabez , after <name> had spoken for a while .
<unk> n't so ... . <name> <unk> 's woman she never made nothing .
she come out o ' lewes with her <unk> 's round her heels , an ' she never made nor mended aught till she died .
he had to light fire an ' get breakfast every mornin ' except sundays , while she sowed it abed .
then she took an' died , sixteen , seventeen , year back ; but she never had no <unk> . '
'they was <unk> , ' said jabez apologetically .
'i 'd no call to go in among 'em , but i always allowed <name>  ' 'no .
<name> come out o ' one o ' those lunnon <unk> societies .
after his woman died , <name> got his mother back from his sister over to <unk> , which she 'd gone to house with when <name> married .
his mother kept house for <name> after his woman died .
they do say 't was his mother led him on toward <unk> ' of <name>  to furnish out the house with a child , like , and to keep him off of gettin ' a noo woman .
he mostly done what his mother contrived .
<unk> , <unk> 'em , they asked for a child from one o ' those lunnon societies  same as it might <name> ' been these <unk> children  an ' <name> was sent down to 'em , in a <unk> , i 've heard . '
'then <name> is <unk> .
i never knowed that , ' said jabez .
<unk> i must <name> ' heard it some time or other ... ' 'no .
she ai n't .
'twould <name> ' been better for some folk if she had been .
she come to <name> in a <unk> with all the proper papers  lawful child o ' some couple in lunnon somewheres  mother dead , father drinkin ' .
and there was that lunnon society 's five shillin 's a week for her .
<name> 's mother she would n't despise week-end money , but i never heard <name> was much of a <unk> .
let be how 'twill , they two <unk> up <name> no bounds , till it looked at last like they 'd forgot she was n't their own flesh an ' blood .
yes , i reckon they forgot <name> was n't <unk> by rights . '
'that 's no new thing , ' said jabez .
'there 's more'n one or two in this parish would n't surrender back their <unk> .
you ask <name> copley an' his woman an ' that <unk> <unk> o ' theirs . '
'maybe they need the five shillin ' , ' <name> suggested .
'it 's handy , ' said jabez .
'but the child 's more .
" <unk> " he says , an' " <unk> " he says , with his great rollin ' <unk> all <unk> up in that iron collar .
he wo n't live long  his backbone 's rotten , like .
but they <unk> do just about set store by him  five <name> or no five <name> . '
<unk> way with <name> an ' his mother , ' <name> went on .
'there was talk betwixt 'em after a few years o ' not takin ' any more week-end money for <name> ; but let alone she never passed a <unk> in the mire 'thout <unk> 's , <name> did n't care , like , to push himself forward into the society 's remembrance .
so <unk> came of it .
the week-end money would ha' made no odds to <name>  not after his uncle willed him they four cottages at <unk> an' money in the bank . '
'that was true , too , then ?
i heard something in a <unk> <unk> way , ' said jabez .
'i 'll answer for the house property , because <name> he requested my signed name at the foot o ' some papers <unk> ' it .
<unk> ' the money in the bank , he <unk> would n't like such things talked about all round the parish , so he took strangers for witnesses . '
'then 'twill make <name> worth <unk> ' after ? '
'she 'll need it .
her maker ai n't done much for her outside nor yet in . '
'that ai n't no odds . '
jabez shook his head till the water showered off his <unk> .
'if <name> has money , she 'll be wed before any likely pore maid .
she 's cause to be grateful to <name> . '
'she hides it middlin ' close , then , ' said <name> .
'it do n't sometimes look to me as if <name> has her natural rightful feelin 's .
she do n't put on an apron o ' <unk> 'thout being <unk> to it  in the kitchen or the hen-house .
she 's <unk> ' to be a school-teacher .
she 'll make a beauty !
i never knowed her show any sort o ' kindness to nobody  not even when <name> 's mother was took dumb .
no !
<unk> n't no stroke .
it stifled the old <name> in the throat here .
first she could n't shape her words no shape ; then she <unk> , like , an ' lastly she could n't more than suck down <unk> an ' hold her peace .
<name> took her to doctor <unk> , an' <unk> he bundled her off to brighton hospital on a ticket , but they could n't make no stay to her <unk> there ; and she was bundled off to lunnon , an ' they lit a great old lamp inside her , and <name> told me they could n't make out nothing in no sort there ; and , along o ' one thing an ' another , an ' all their <unk> 's and <unk> 's , she come back a hem sight worse than when she started .
<name> said he 'd have no more <unk> ' , so he give her a slate , which she tied to her <unk> , and what she was minded to say she writ on it . '
'now , i never knowed that !
but they 're <unk> , ' jabez repeated .
<unk> n't particular noticeable , for she was n't a talkin ' woman any time o ' her days .
<name> had all three 's tongue ... . well , then , two years this summer , come what i 'm tellin ' you .
<name> 's lunnon father , which they'd put clean out o ' their minds , arrived down from lunnon with the law on his side , sayin ' he 'd take his daughter back to lunnon , after all .
i was working for mus ' <unk> at pounds farm that summer , but i was <unk> <name> that evenin ' <unk> ' out his <unk> .
i seed a stranger come <unk> ' over the bridge agin ' <unk> 's <unk> .
<unk> n't the new county council bridge with the <unk> .
they had n't given it in for a public right o ' way then .
't was just a bit o ' <unk> old plank which <name> had throwed acrost the <name> for his own conveniences .
the man was n't drunk  only a little concerned in liquor , like  an ' his back was a mask where he 'd slipped in the muck comin ' along .
he went up the bricks past <name> 's mother , which was <unk> ' the ducks , an ' set himself down at the table inside  <name> was just changin ' his socks  an ' the man let <name> know all his rights and aims <unk> ' <name> .
then there just about was a <unk> ?
<name> 's fust mind was to pitch him forth , but he 'd done that once in his young days , and got six months up to lewes jail along o ' the man fallin ' on his head .
so he swallowed his <unk> an ' let him talk .
the law about <name> was on the man 's side from fust to last , for he showed us all the papers .
then <name> come downstairs  she 'd been <unk> ' for an examination  an ' the man tells her who he was , an ' she says he had ought to have took proper care of his own flesh and blood while he had it by him , an ' not to think he could <unk> it when it suited .
he says somethin ' or other , but she looks him up an ' down , front an ' <unk> , an ' she just tongues him <unk> ' out o ' doors , and he went away <unk> ' all the papers back into his hat , talkin ' most <unk> .
then she come back an ' freed her mind against <name> an ' his mother for not havin ' warned her of her <unk> 's , which it come out she had n't ever been told .
they didn't say <unk> to her .
they never did .
i'd <name> ' packed her off with any man that would <name> ' took her  an ' god 's pity on him ! '
<unk> ! '
said jabez , and sucked his pipe .
'so then , that was the beginnin . '
the man come back again next week or so , an ' he catched <name> alone , 'thout his mother this time , an ' he fair <unk> him with his papers an ' his talk  for the law was on his side  till <name> went down into his <unk> an ' give him ten shillings <unk>  he told me  to withdraw away for a bit an ' leave <name> with 'em . '
'but that 's no way to get rid o ' man or woman , ' jabez said .
'no more 't is .
i told <name> so .
" what can i do ? "
<name> says .
" the <unk> with the man .
i walk about <unk> thinkin ' o ' it till i <unk> my <unk> <unk> ' , an ' i lie abed nights thinkin ' o ' it till i <unk> my sheets all of a <unk> .
't is n't as if i was a young man , " he says , " nor yet as if i was a pore man .
maybe he 'll drink hisself to death . "
i e'en <unk> told him outright what foolishness he was <unk> into , but he knowed it  he knowed it  because he said next time the man come 'twould be fifteen shillin 's .
an ' next time 't was .
just fifteen shillin 's ! '
'an ' was the man her father ? '
asked jabez .
'he had the proofs an ' the papers .
<name> showed me what that lunnon <unk> 's society had answered when <name> writ up to 'em an ' taxed 'em with it .
i lay she had n't been proper polite in her letters to 'em , for they answered middlin ' short .
they said the matter was out o ' their hands , but  let 's see if i remember  oh , yes ,  they <unk> there had been an oversight .
i reckon they had sent <name> out in the <unk> as a orphan instead o ' havin ' a father .
terrible awkward !
then , when he 'd <unk> up the money , the man come again  in his <unk>  an ' he kept <unk> ' on and <unk> ' on about his duty to his pore dear wife , an ' what he 'd do for his dear daughter in lunnon , till the tears <unk> down his two dirty cheeks an ' he come away with more money .
<name> used to slip it into his hand behind the door ; but his mother she heard the chink .
she did n't hold with <unk> .
she 'd write out all her <unk> on the slate , an ' <name> 'ud be settin ' up half the night <unk> ' back an ' showing that the man had the law with him . '
'had n't that man no trade nor business , then ? '
'he told me he was a printer .
i reckon , though , he lived on the rates like the rest of 'em up there in lunnon . '
'an ' how did <name> take it ? '
'she said she 'd sooner go into service than go with the man .
i reckon a mistress 'ud be middlin ' put to it for a maid 'fore she put <name> into cap an ' gown .
she was <unk> ' to be a <unk> .
a beauty she 'll make ! ...
well , that was how things went that fall .
<name> 's lunnon father kep ' comin ' an ' comin ' <unk> as he 'd <unk> out the money <name> gave him ; an ' each time he 'd put-up his price for not takin ' <name> away .
<name> 's mother , she did n't like <unk> ' with no money , an ' bein ' obliged to write her feelin 's on the slate instead o ' givin ' 'em vent by mouth , she was just about mad .
just about she was mad !
'come november , i lodged with <name> in the outside room over 'gainst his hen-house .
i paid her my rent .
i was workin ' for <unk> at pounds  gettin ' <unk> out o ' <name> shaw .
just such weather as this be  rain atop o ' rain after a wet october .
( an ' i remember it ended in dry <unk> right away up to christmas . )
<unk> he 'd sent up to <name> shaw for me  no , he comes <unk> ' up to me himself  because a big <unk> o ' the bank had slipped into the <name> where she makes that <unk> at the bottom o ' the seventeen acre , an ' all the <unk> alders an ' sallies which he ought to have cut out when he took the farm , they 'd slipped with the slip , an ' the <name> was comin ' <unk> ' down atop of 'em , an ' they 'd just about back an ' spill the waters over his <name> wheat .
the water was lyin ' in the flats already .
" <unk> <unk> , <name> ! "
he <unk> out at me , " get that rubbish away all manners you can .
do n't stop for no <unk> ' , but give the <name> play or my <unk> past salvation .
i ca n't lend you no help , " he says , " but work an' i 'll pay ye . " '
'you had him there , ' jabez chuckled .
'yes .
i reckon i had ought to have drove my bargain , but the <name> was <unk> ' up on good <unk> .
so <unk> , i laid into the mess of it , workin ' off the bank where the trees was <unk> ' themselves <unk> in the <unk>  just such weather as this  an ' the <name> <unk> ' up on me all the time .
'long toward noon , <name> comes <unk> ' along with his <unk> ' axe over his shoulder .
' " be you minded for an extra hand at your job ? "
he says .
' " be you minded to turn to ? "
i ses , an '  no more talk to it  <name> laid in alongside o ' me .
he 's no hunger with a <unk> ' axe . '
'maybe , but i 've seed him at a job o ' <unk> ' in the woods , an ' he did n't seem to make out no shape , ' said jabez .
'he have n't got the shoulders , nor yet the judgment  my opinion  when he 's <unk> ' with <unk> timber .
he do n't rightly make up his mind where he 's goin ' to throw her . '
'we was n't <unk> ' nothin ' .
we was <unk> ' out they soft alders , an' <unk> ' 'em up the bank 'fore they could back the waters on the wheat .
<name> did n't say much , 'less it was that he 'd had a <unk> from mary's lunnon father , night before , sayin ' he was comin ' down that mornin ' .
<name> , he 'd sweated all night , an ' he did n't reckon hisself equal to the talkin ' an ' the swearin ' an ' the cryin ' , an ' his mother <unk> ' him afterwards on the slate .
" it <unk> my day to think of it , " he ses , when we was <unk> ' our pieces .
" so i 've fair cried <unk> an ' run .
mother 'll have to tackle him by herself .
i lay she wo n't give him no <unk> , " he ses .
" i lay he 'll be surprised by the time he 's done with her , " he ses .
an ' that was e'en <unk> all the talk we had <unk> ' it .
but he 's no hunger with the <unk> ' axe .
'the <name> she 'd <unk> ' up an ' up on us , an ' she kep ' <unk> ' upon us till we was workin ' knee-deep in the <unk> , <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' an' <unk> ' what we could get to o ' the rubbish .
there was a middlin ' lot comin ' down-stream , too  <unk> , an ' <unk> and <unk> bats , all <unk> ' down together ; but they <unk> round the <unk> good shape by the time we 'd backed out they drowned trees .
come four o'clock we reckoned we 'd done a proper day 's work , an ' she 'd take no harm if we left her .
we could n't puddle about there in the dark an ' wet to no more advantage .
<name> he was <unk> ' the water out of his boots  no , i was doin ' that .
<name> was <unk> ' to <unk> his'n .
" damn it all , <name> , " he ses , standin ' up ; " the flood must be over my <unk> at home , for here comes my old <unk> <unk> ! " '
'yes .
i allus heard he paints his <unk> , ' jabez put in .
'i dunno paint do n't <unk> bees more'n it keeps em ' dry . '
' " i 'll have a pook at it , " he ses , an ' he <unk> at it as it comes round the <unk> .
the <unk> nigh jerked the <unk> out of his <unk> , an' he calls to me , an ' i come runnin ' barefoot .
then we pulled on the <unk> , an ' it reared up on <unk> in the <unk> , an ' we guessed what 'twas .
<unk> we pulled it in into a <unk> , an ' it rolled a piece , an ' a great old stiff man 's arm nigh hit me in the face .
then we was sure .
" 't is a man , " ses <name> .
but the face was all a mask .
" i reckon it's <name> 's lunnon father , " he ses presently .
" lend me a match and i 'll make sure . "
he never used <unk> .
we lit three matches one by another , <unk> we could in the rain , an ' he cleaned off some o ' the <unk> with a <unk> o ' grass .
" yes , " he ses .
" it 's <name> 's lunnon father .
he wo n't <unk> us no more .
d'you want him , <name> ? "
he ses .
' " no , " i ses .
" if this was <unk> beach like , he 'd be <unk> apiece to us 'fore the coroner ; but now we 'd only lose a day havin ' to <unk> the inquest .
i lay he fell into the <name> . "
' " i lay he did , " ses <name> .
" i wonder if he saw mother . "
he turns him over , an ' opens his coat and puts his fingers in the waistcoat pocket an ' starts laughin ' .
" he 's seen mother , right enough , " he ses .
" an ' he's got the best of her , too .
she wo n't be able to crow no more over me 'bout givin ' him money .
i never give him more than a sovereign .
she's give him two ! "
an ' he trousers 'em , laughin ' all the time .
" an ' now we 'll pook him back again , for i 've done with him , " he ses .
'so we <unk> him back into the middle of the <name> , an ' we saw he went round the <unk> 'thout <unk> ' , an ' we walked quite a piece beside of him to set him on his ways .
when we could n't see no more , we went home by the high road , because we knowed the <name> <unk> 'd be out acrost the <unk> , an ' we was n't goin ' to hunt for <name> 's little rotten old bridge in that dark  an ' <unk> ' heavens ' hard , too .
i was middlin ' pleased to see light an ' vittles again when we got home .
<name> he pressed me to come insides for a drink .
he do n't drink in a generality , but he was rid of all his troubles that evenin ' , d 'ye see ?
" mother , " he ses so soon as the door <unk> 'd , " have you seen him ? "
she whips out her slate an ' writes down  " no . "
" oh , no , " ses <name> .
" you do n't get out of it that way , mother .
i lay you have seen him , an ' i lay he 's <unk> you for all your talk , same as he <unk> me .
make a clean breast of it , mother , " he ses .
" he got round you too . "
she was goin ' for the slate again , but he stops her .
" it 's all right , mother , " he ses .
" i 've seen him sense you have , an ' he wo n't trouble us no more . "
the old <name> looks up quick as a <name> , an ' she writes , " did he say so ? "
" no , " ses <name> , laughin ' .
" he did n't say so .
that 's how i know .
but he <unk> you , mother .
you can't have it in at me for bein ' <unk> .
you 're twice as <unk> as what i be .
look ! "
he ses , an ' he shows her the two sovereigns .
" put 'em away where they belong , " he ses .
" he wo n't never come for no more ; an ' now we 'll have our drink , " he ses , " for we've earned it . "
<unk> they were n't goin ' to let me see where they kep ' their <unk> .
she went upstairs with it  for the whisky . '
'i never knowed <name> was a drinkin ' man  in his own house , like , ' said jabez .
'no more he is n't ; but what he takes he likes good .
he wo n't tech no publican 's <unk> acrost the bar .
four shillin 's he paid for that bottle o ' whisky .
i know , because when the old <name> brought it down there was n't more'n jest a liddle few <unk> 's an ' <unk> in it .
<unk> to set before neighbours , i do assure you . '
' " why , 't was half full last week , mother , " he ses .
" you do n't mean , " he ses , " you 've given him all that as well ?
it 's two shillin 's worth , " he ses .
( that 's how i knowed he paid four . )
" well , well , mother , you be too <unk> to live .
but i do n't grudge it to him , " he ses .
" i don't grudge him nothin ' he can keep . "
so , <unk> , we <unk> up what little sup was left . '
'an ' what come to <name> 's lunnon father ? '
said jabez after a full minute 's silence .
'i be too tired to go <unk> ' papers of evenin 's ; but <unk> he told me , that very week , i think , that they 'd <unk> on a man down at <unk> which had poked and poked up agin ' so many bridges an' banks , like , they could n't make <unk> out of him . '
'an ' what did <name> say to all these doin 's ? '
'the old <name> bundled her off to the village 'fore her lunnon father come , to buy week-end stuff ( an ' she forgot the half o ' it ) .
when we come in she was upstairs <unk> ' to be a school-teacher .
none told her <unk> about it .
<unk> n't girls ' affairs . '
<unk> she knowed ? '
jabez went on .
'she ?
she must have guessed it middlin ' close when she saw her money come back .
but she never mentioned it in writing so far 's i know .
she were more <unk> that night on account of <unk> her chickens bein ' drowned , for the flood had <unk> their old hen-house round on her <unk> .
i <unk> her up next mornin ' when the <name> <unk> . '
'an ' where did you find the bridge ?
some fur down-stream , did n't ye ? '
'just where she allus was .
she had n't shifted but very little .
the <name> had <unk> out the bank a piece under one <unk> o ' the plank , so 's she was liable to tilt ye sideways if you was n't careful .
but i <unk> <unk> bricks under her , an ' she was all plumb again . '
'well , i dunno how it looks like , but let be how 'twill , ' said jabez , 'he had n't no business to come down from lunnon <unk> ' people , an' <unk> ' to take away children which they 'd <unk> up for their lawful own  even if 't was <name> <unk> . '
'he had the business right enough , an ' he had the law with him  no gettin ' over that , ' said <name> .
'but he had the drink with him , too , an' that was where he failed , like . '
'well , well !
let be how 'twill , the <name> was a good friend to <name> .
i see it now .
i allus did wonder what he was gettin ' at when he said that , when i talked to him about <unk> ' the stack .
" you dunno <unk> ' , " he ses .
" the <name> 's been a good friend to me , " he ses , " an ' if she 's minded to have a snatch at my hay , i ai n't settin ' out to withstand her . " '
'i reckon she 's about shifted it , too , by now , ' <name> chuckled .
<unk> !
that ai n't any slip off the bank which she 's got hold of . '
the <name> had changed her note again .
it sounded as though she were mumbling something soft .
the land when <name> fabricius , <unk> of the weald , in the days of <unk> owned our lower <unk> , he called to him <unk>  a briton of the <name> , saying : 'what about that <unk> for layin ' in to hay ? '
and the aged hobden answered : 'i remember as a lad my father told your father that she wanted <unk> ' bad .
an ' the more that you <unk> her the less you 'll get her clean .
have it jest as you 've a mind to , but , if i was you , i 'd <unk> . '
so they drained it long and crossways in the lavish <name> style .
still we find among the <unk> their flakes of ancient tile , and in <unk> middle <name> , when the bones of meadows show , we can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago .
then <name> fabricius died as even prefects do , and after certain centuries , imperial rome died too .
then did robbers enter britain from across the northern main and our lower <unk> was won by <unk> the <name> .
well could <unk> work his <unk>  well could <unk> wield his brand  much he knew of foaming waters  not so much of farming land .
so he called to him a hobden of the old unaltered blood .
saying : 'what about that <unk> , she does n't look no good ? '
and that aged hobden answered : <unk> n't for me to interfere , but i 've known that bit o ' meadow now for five and fifty year .
have it jest as you 've a mind to , but i 've proved it time on time , if you want to change her nature you have got to give her lime ! '
<unk> sent his <unk> to lewes , twenty hours ' solemn walk , and <name> back great abundance of the cool , grey , healing chalk .
and old hobden spread it <unk> , never heeding what was i n't ; which is why in cleaning ditches , now and then we find a flint .
<unk> died .
his sons grew english .
anglo-saxon was their name , till out of blossomed normandy another pirate came ; for duke <name> conquered england and divided with his men , and our lower <unk> he gave to <name> of <unk> .
but the <name> ( you know her habit ) rose one rainy autumn night and tore down sodden <unk> of the bank to left and right .
so , said <name> to his bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds : <unk> , what about that <unk>  the <name> 's got up no bounds ? '
and that aged hobden answered : <unk> n't my business to advise , but ye might <name> ' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies .
when ye ca n't hold back the water you must try and save the <unk> .
hev it jest as you 've a mind to , but , if i was you , i 'd <unk> ! '
they <unk> along the water-course with trunks of <unk> and planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees .
and when the <unk> of autumn whirl the <unk> away you can see their faithful fragments <unk> in iron <name> .
* * * * * <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , i , who own the <unk> , am fortified with <unk> , attested , signed and sealed , <unk> me , my assigns , my <unk> and heirs all sorts of powers and profits which  are neither mine nor theirs .
i have rights of <name> and <name> , as my dignity requires .
i can fish  but hobden <unk> .
i can shoot  but hobden wires .
i repair , but he <unk> , certain gaps which , men <unk> , have been used by every hobden since a hobden <unk> a hedge .
shall i dog his morning progress o'er the <unk> dew ?
demand his <unk> into which my pheasant flew ?
confiscate his evening <unk> into which the <unk> ran , and summons him to judgment ?
i would sooner summons pan .
his dead are in the churchyard  thirty generations laid .
their names went down in domesday book when domesday book was made .
and the passion and the piety and prowess of his line have <unk> , rooted , <unk> in some land the law calls mine .
not for any beast that burrows , not for any bird that flies , would i lose his large sound council , miss his keen <unk> eyes .
he is bailiff , woodman , wheelwright , <unk> , engineer , and if <unk> a <unk>  'tai n't for me to interfere .
<unk> , what about that <unk> ? '
i turn to him again with fabricius and <unk> and <name> of <unk> .
<unk> it jest as you 've a mind to , but '  and so he takes command .
for whoever pays the taxes old mus ' hobden owns the land .
in the same boat ( <unk> ) 'a throbbing vein , ' said dr. <name> soothingly , 'is the mother of delusion . '
'then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due ? '
<unk> voice rose almost to a break .
'of course , but you should have consulted a doctor before using  <unk> . '
'it was driving me mad .
and now i ca n't give them up . '
<unk> so bad as that !
one does n't form fatal habits at twenty-five .
think again .
were you ever frightened as a child ? '
'i do n't remember .
it began when i was a boy . '
'with or without the spasm ?
by the way , do you mind describing the spasm again ? '
'well , ' said conroy , twisting in the chair , 'i 'm no musician , but suppose you were a <unk>  vibrating  and some one put his finger on you ?
as if a finger were put on the naked soul !
awful ! '
'so 's indigestion  so 's nightmare  while it lasts . '
'but the horror afterwards knocks me out for days .
and the waiting for it ... and then this drug habit !
it ca n't go on ! '
he shook as he spoke , and the chair creaked .
'my dear fellow , ' said the doctor , 'when you 're older you 'll know what burdens the best of us <name> .
a fox to every spartan . '
'that does n't help me .
i ca n't !
i ca n't ! '
cried conroy , and burst into tears .
'do n't apologise , ' said <name> , when the paroxysm ended .
'i 'm used to people coming a little  <unk> in this room . '
'it 's those <unk> ! '
conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his nose .
'they 've knocked me out .
i used to be fit once .
oh , i 've tried exercise and everything .
but  if one sits down for a minute when it's due  even at four in the morning  it runs up behind one . '
<unk> .
many things come in the quiet of the morning .
you always know when the visitation is due ? '
'what would i give not to be sure ! '
he sobbed .
'we 'll put that aside for the moment .
i 'm thinking of a case where what we 'll call <unk> of the <name> was masked ( i do n't say cured ) by vibration .
he could n't sleep , or thought he could n't , but a steamer voyage and the thump of the screw  ' 'a steamer ?
after what i 've told you ! '
conroy almost shrieked .
<unk> sooner ... ' 'of course not a steamer in your case , but a long railway journey the next time you think it <name> trouble you .
it sounds absurd , but  ' 'i 'd try anything .
i nearly have , ' conroy sighed .
<unk> !
i 've given you a tonic that <name> clear that notion from your head .
give the train a chance , and do n't begin the journey by <unk> yourself up with <unk> .
take them along , but hold them in reserve  in reserve . '
'd'you think i 've self-control enough , after what you 've heard ? '
said conroy .
dr. <name> smiled .
'yes .
after what i 've seen , ' he glanced round the room , 'i have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much self-control as many other people .
i 'll write you later about your journey .
meantime , the tonic , ' and he gave some general directions before conroy left .
an hour later dr. <name> hurried to the links , where the others of his regular week-end game awaited him .
it was a rigid round , played as usual at the trot , for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two king's counsels and sir <name> chartres as on <name> .
the lawyers were old enemies of the admiralty court , and sir <name> of the frosty eyebrows and <unk> manner was <unk> with , but before , <unk> <name> among <unk> .
at the <unk> afterwards the lawyers renewed their <unk> over a tangled collision case , and the doctors as naturally compared professional matters .
<unk>  all lies , ' said sir <name> , when <name> had told him <unk> trouble .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the man or woman who drugs is <unk> <unk> a liar .
you 've no imagination . '
<unk> you have n't a little  occasionally . '
'i have believed a certain type of patient in my time .
it 's always the same .
for reasons not given in the <unk> they take to the drug .
certain symptoms follow .
they <name> swear to you , and believe it , that they took the drug to mask the symptoms .
what does your man use ?
<unk> ?
i thought so .
i had practically the duplicate of your case last thursday .
same old <unk>  same old lie . '
'tell me the symptoms , and i 'll draw my own inferences , <name> . '
<unk> !
the girl was rank poisoned with <unk> .
<unk> , stamping possession .
gad , i thought she 'd have the chandelier down . '
<unk> came <unk> too , and he has the physique of a bull , ' said <name> .
'what delusions had yours ? '
<unk>  faces with mildew on them .
in any other walk of life we 'd call it the horrors .
she told me , of course , she took the drugs to mask the faces .
post <unk> , <unk> <unk> again .
all liars ! '
'what 's that ? '
said the senior <unk> .
quickly .
<unk> professional . '
'go away !
not for you , <name> . '
sir <name> turned a shoulder against him and walked with <name> in the chill evening .
to conroy in his chambers came , one week later , this letter : dear mr. conroy  if your plan of a night 's trip on the 17th still holds good , and you have no particular destination in view , you could do me a kindness .
a miss henschil , in whom i am interested , goes down to the west by the <unk> from waterloo ( number 3 platform ) on that night .
she is not exactly an invalid , but , like so many of us , a little shaken in her nerves .
her maid , of course , accompanies her , but if i knew you were in the same train it would be an additional source of strength .
<name> you please write and let me know whether the <unk> from waterloo , number 3 platform , on the 17th , suits you , and i <name> meet you there ?
do n't forget my caution , and keep up the <unk>  yours sincerely , l. <unk> <name> .
'he knows i 'm scarcely fit to look after myself , ' was conroy 's thought .
'and he wants me to look after a woman ! '
yet , at the end of half an hour 's <unk> , he accepted .
now conroy 's trouble , which had lasted for years , was this : on a certain night , while he lay between sleep and wake , he would be overtaken by a long shuddering sigh , which he learned to know was the sign that his <name> had once more conceived its horror , and in time  in due time  would bring it forth .
drugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse than as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams ; but over the return of the event drugs had no control .
once that sigh had passed his lips the thing was inevitable , and through the days granted before its rebirth he walked in torment .
for the first two years he had striven to fend it off by <unk> , but neither exercise nor drink availed .
then he had come to the <unk> of the excellent m. <unk> .
these guarantee , on the label , <unk> and absolutely natural sleep to the <unk> . '
they are carried in a case with a spring which presses one scented <unk> to the end of the tube , whence it can be <unk> off in stroking the moustache or adjusting the veil .
three years of m. <unk> 's preparations do not fit a man for many careers .
his friends , who knew he did not drink , assumed that conroy had strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises , and conroy had with some care invented an imaginary doctor , symptoms , and <unk> , which he discussed with them and with his mother in <unk> .
she maintained that he would grow out of it , and recommended <unk> <unk> .
when at last conroy faced a real doctor , it was , he hoped , to be saved from suicide by a <unk> .
yet dr. <name> had but given him more drugs  a tonic , for instance , that would couple railway <unk>  and had advised a night in the train .
not alone the horrors of a railway journey ( for which a man who dare keep no servant must e'en pack , label , and address his own bag ) , but the necessity for holding himself in hand before a stranger 'a little shaken in her nerves . '
he spent a long forenoon packing , because when he assembled and counted things his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before his night , and he found himself counting minutes aloud .
at such times the injustice of his fate would drive him to <unk> which no servant should witness , but on this evening dr. <name> 's tonic held him fairly calm while he put up his patent razors .
waterloo station shook him into real life .
the change for his ticket needed concentration , if only to prevent shillings and pence turning into minutes at the <unk> ; and he spoke quickly to a <name> about the disposition of his bag .
the old <unk> from waterloo to the west was an <unk> caravan that halted , in the interests of the milk traffic , at almost every station .
dr. <name> stood by the door of the one composite <unk> ; an older and <unk> man behind him .
'so glad you 're here ! '
he cried .
'let me get your ticket . '
'certainly not , ' conroy answered .
'i got it myself  long ago .
my <unk> in too , ' he added proudly .
'i beg your pardon .
miss henschil 's here .
i 'll introduce you . '
'but  but , ' he stammered  'think of the state i 'm in .
if anything happens i shall collapse . '
'not you .
you 'd rise to the occasion like a bird .
and as for the self-control you were talking of the other day '  <name> swung him round  'look ! '
a young man in an ulster over a <unk> frock-coat stood by the carriage window , weeping shamelessly .
'oh , but that 's only drink , ' conroy said .
'i have n't had one of my  my things since lunch . '
<unk> ! '
said <name> .
'i knew i could depend on you .
come along .
wait for a minute , chartres . '
a tall woman , veiled , sat by the far window .
she bowed her head as the doctor murmured conroy knew not what .
then he disappeared and the inspector came for tickets .
'my maid  next compartment , ' she said slowly .
conroy showed his ticket , but in returning it to the <unk> of his ulster the little silver <unk> case slipped from his glove and fell to the floor .
he snatched it up as the moving train flung him into his seat .
'how nice ! '
said the woman .
she leisurely lifted her veil , <unk> the first button of her left glove , and pressed out from its palm a <unk> .
'do n't ! '
said conroy , not <unk> he had spoken .
'i beg your pardon . '
the deep voice was measured , even , and low .
conroy knew what made it so .
'i said " do n't " !
he would n't like you to do it ! '
'no , he would not . '
she held the tube with its <unk> <unk> between finger and thumb .
'but are n't you one of the  ah  " <unk> " too ? '
'that 's why .
oh , please do n't !
not at first .
i  i have n't had one since morning .
you  you 'll set me off ! '
'you ?
are you so far gone as that ? '
he nodded , pressing his palms together .
the train jolted through vauxhall points , and was welcomed with the clang of empty <unk> for the west .
after long silence she lifted her great eyes , and , with an innocence that would have deceived any sound man , asked conroy to call her maid to bring her a forgotten book .
conroy shook his head .
'no .
our sort ca n't read .
do n't ! '
'were you sent to watch me ? '
the voice never changed .
'me ?
i need a keeper myself much more  this night of all ! '
'this night ?
have you a night , then ?
they <unk> me when i told them of mine . '
she leaned back and laughed , always slowly .
<unk> doctors <unk> ?
they do n't know . '
she leaned her elbow on her knee , lifted her veil that had fallen , and , <name> in hand , stared at him .
he looked at her  till his eyes were blurred with tears .
'have i been there , think you ? '
she said .
'surely  surely , ' conroy answered , for he had well seen the fear and the horror that lived behind the <unk> eyes , the fine tracing on the broad forehead , and the guard set about the desirable mouth .
'then  suppose we have one  just one apiece ?
i 've gone without since this afternoon . '
he put up his hand , and would have shouted , but his voice broke .
'do n't !
ca n't you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off ?
don't let 's both go down together . '
'but i want one .
it 's a poor heart that never rejoices .
just one .
it's my night . '
'it 's mine  too .
my <unk> , fifth , sixth , seventh . '
he shut his lips firmly against the tide of <unk> <name> that threatened to <name> him along .
'ah , it 's only my <unk> . '
she paused as he had done .
'i wonder if i shall last into the <unk> ... . talk to me or i shall go crazy .
you're a man .
you 're the stronger vessel .
tell me when you went to pieces . '
'one , two , three , four , five , six , seven  eight  i beg your pardon . '
'not in the least .
i always pretend i 've dropped a stitch of my knitting .
i count the days till the last day , then the hours , then the minutes .
do you ? '
'i do n't think i 've done very much else for the last  ' said conroy , shivering , for the night was cold , with a chill he recognised .
'oh , how comforting to find some one who can talk sense !
it 's not always the same date , is it ? '
'what difference would that make ? '
he <unk> his ulster with a jerk .
'you 're a sane woman .
ca n't you see the wicked  wicked  wicked ' ( dust flew from the padded <unk> as he struck it ) <unk> of it ?
what have i done ? '
she laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly .
'if you begin to think over that , ' she said , 'you 'll go to pieces and be ashamed .
tell me yours , and i 'll tell you mine .
only be quiet  be quiet , lad , or you 'll set me off ! '
she made shift to soothe him , though her <name> trembled .
'well , ' said he at last , picking at the <unk> between them , <unk> nothing much , of course . '
'do n't be a fool !
that 's for doctors  and mothers . '
'it 's hell , ' conroy muttered .
'it begins on a steamer  on a stifling hot night .
i come out of my cabin .
i pass through the saloon where the stewards have rolled up the carpets , and the boards are bare and hot and <unk> . '
'i 've travelled too , ' she said .
'ah !
i come on deck .
i walk down a covered alleyway .
butcher 's meat , bananas , oil , that sort of smell . '
again she nodded .
'it 's a <unk> steamer , and the sea 's <unk> .
perfectly smooth sea  perfectly still ship , except for the engines running , and her waves going off in lines and lines and lines  dull grey .
all this time i know something 's going to happen . '
'i know .
something going to happen , ' she whispered .
'then i hear a thud in the engine-room .
then the noise of machinery falling down  like <unk>  and then two most awful yells .
they're more like <unk> , and i know  i know while i listen  that it means that two men have died as they hooted .
it was their last breath hooting out of them  in most awful pain .
do you understand ? '
'i ought to .
go on . '
'that 's the first part .
then i hear bare feet running along the alleyway .
one of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite distinctly , " my friend !
all is lost ! "
then he taps me on the shoulder and i hear him drop down dead . '
he panted and wiped his forehead .
'so that is your night ? '
she said .
'that is my night .
it comes every few weeks  so many days after i get what i call sentence .
then i begin to count . '
'get sentence ?
d'you mean this ? '
she half closed her eyes , <name> a deep breath , and shuddered .
' " notice " i call it .
sir <name> thought it was all lies . '
she had <unk> her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite , showing the immense mass of her black hair , rolled low in the nape of the columnar neck and looped over the left ear .
but conroy had no eyes except for her grave eyes .
'listen now ! '
said she .
'i walk down a road , a white <name> road near the sea .
there are broken fences on either side , and men come and look at me over them . '
'just men ?
do they speak ? '
'they try to .
their faces are all <unk>  eaten away , ' and she hid her face for an instant with her left hand .
'it 's the faces  the faces ! '
'yes .
like my two <unk> .
i know . '
'ah !
but the place itself  the <unk>  and the glitter and the salt smells , and the wind blowing the sand !
the men run after me and i run ... .
i know what 's coming too .
one of them touches me . '
'yes !
what comes then ?
we 've both shirked that . '
'one awful shock  not <unk> , but shock , shock , shock ! '
'as though your soul were being stopped  as you 'd stop a <unk> humming ? '
he said .
'just that , ' she answered .
'one 's very soul  the soul that one lives by  stopped .
so ! '
she drove her thumb deep into the <unk> .
'and now , ' she whined to him , 'now that we 've stirred each other up this way , might n't we have just one ? '
'no , ' said conroy , shaking .
'let 's hold on .
we 're past '  he peered out of the black windows  <unk> .
there 's the <unk> .
how long till <name> ? '
'oh , cruel long yet .
if one <unk> for a minute , it catches one . '
'and how d'you find that this '  he tapped the palm of his glove  <unk> you ? '
'it covers up the thing from being too real  if one takes enough  you know .
only  only  one loses everything else .
i 've been no more than a <unk> for two years .
what would you give to be real again ?
this lying 's such a nuisance . '
'one must protect oneself  and there 's one 's mother to think of , ' he answered .
'true .
i <name> allowances are made for us somewhere .
our burden  can you hear ?  our burden is heavy enough . '
she rose , towering into the roof of the carriage .
conroy 's <unk> grip pulled her back .
'now you are foolish .
sit down , ' said he .
'but the cruelty of it !
ca n't you see it ?
do n't you feel it ?
let 's take one now  before i  ' 'sit down ! '
cried conroy , and the sweat stood again on his forehead .
he had fought through a few nights , and had been defeated on more , and he knew the rebellion that <unk> beyond control to exhaustion .
she smoothed her hair and dropped back , but for a while her head and throat moved with the sickening motion of a captured <unk> .
'once , ' she said , spreading out her hands , 'i ripped my <unk> from end to end .
that takes strength .
i had it then .
i 've little now .
" all <unk> , " as my little niece says .
and you , lad ? '
' " all <unk> " !
let me keep your case for you till the morning . '
'but the cold feeling is beginning . '
<unk> it me , then . '
'and the drag down my right side .
i <name> n't be able to move in a minute . '
'i can scarcely lift my arm myself , ' said conroy .
'we 're in for it . '
'then why are you so foolish ?
you know it 'll be easier if we have only one  only one apiece . '
she was lifting the case to her mouth .
with tremendous effort conroy caught it .
the two moved like jointed dolls , and when their hands met it was as wood on wood .
'you must  not ! '
said conroy .
his jaws stiffened , and the cold climbed from his feet up .
'why  must  i  not ? '
she repeated the words <unk> .
conroy could only shake his head , while he bore down on the hand and the case in it .
her speech went from her altogether .
the wonderful lips rested half over the even teeth , the breath was in the nostrils only , the eyes dulled , the face set grey , and through the glove the hand struck like ice .
presently her soul came back and stood behind her eyes  only thing that had life in all that place  stood and looked for conroy 's soul .
he too was fettered in every limb , but somewhere at an immense distance he heard his heart going about its work as the engine-room carries on through and beneath the all but overwhelming wave .
his one <name> , he knew , was not to lose the eyes that clung to his , because there was an evil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a <unk> .
the rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while cymbals clashed .
( beyond <unk> the <unk> rolls out many empty <unk> at every halt . )
then a body came to life with intolerable <unk> .
limb by limb , after agonies of terror , that body returned to him , steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long day 's rowing .
he saw the heavy lids droop over her eyes  the watcher behind them departed  and , his soul sinking into assured peace , conroy slept .
light on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock .
her hand still held his .
she slept , forehead down upon it , but the movement of his waking waked her too , and she sneezed like a child .
'i  i think it 's morning , ' said conroy .
'and nothing has happened !
did you see your men ?
i did n't see my faces .
does it mean we 've escaped ?
did  did you take any after i went to sleep ?
i 'll swear i did n't , ' she stammered .
'no , there was n't any need .
we 've slept through it . '
'no need !
thank god !
there was no need !
oh , look ! '
the train was running under red cliffs along a <unk> washed by waves that were colourless in the early light .
southward the sun rose <unk> upon the channel .
she leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs , while the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below her waist .
'well ! '
she said with splendid eyes .
'are n't you still waiting for something to happen ? '
'no .
not till next time .
we 've been let off , ' conroy answered , breathing as deeply as she .
'then we ought to say our prayers . '
'what nonsense !
some one <name> see us . '
'we need n't kneel .
stand up and say " our father . "
we must ! '
it was the first time since childhood that conroy had prayed .
they laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an <unk> .
'now for breakfast ! '
she cried .
'my maid  nurse blaber  has the basket and things .
it 'll be ready in twenty minutes .
oh !
look at my hair ! '
and she went out laughing .
conroy 's first discovery , made without fumbling or counting letters on taps , was that the london and south western 's allowance of <unk> is inadequate .
he used every drop , rioting in the cold tingle on neck and arms .
to shave in a moving train balked him , but the next halt gave him a chance , which , to his own surprise , he took .
as he stared at himself in the mirror he smiled and nodded .
there were points about this person with the clear , if sunken , eye and the almost <unk> mouth .
but when he bore his bag back to his compartment , the weight of it on a limp arm humbled that new pride .
'my friend , ' he said , half aloud , 'you go into training .
you 're putty . '
she met him in the spare compartment , where her maid had laid breakfast .
'by jove ! '
he said , halting at the doorway , 'i had n't realised how beautiful you were ! '
'the same to you , lad .
sit down .
i could eat a horse . '
'i should n't , ' said the maid quietly .
'the less you eat the better . '
she was a small , freckled woman , with light fluffy hair and pale-blue eyes that looked through all veils .
'this is miss blaber , ' said miss henschil .
'he 's one of the <unk> too , <unk> . '
'i know it .
but when one has just given it up a full meal does n't agree .
that 's why i 've only brought you bread and butter . '
she went out quietly , and conroy reddened .
'we 're still children , you see , ' said miss henschil .
'but i 'm well enough to feel some shame of it .
d'you take sugar ? '
they starved together <unk> , and nurse blaber was good enough to signify approval when she came to clear away .
<unk> ? '
miss henschil <unk> , and flushed .
'do you smoke ? '
said the nurse coolly to conroy .
'i have n't in years .
now you mention it , i think i 'd like a cigarette  or something . '
'i used to .
d'you think it would keep me quiet ? '
miss henschil said .
'perhaps .
try these . '
the nurse handed them her <unk> .
'do n't take anything else , ' she commanded , and went away with the <unk> .
'good ! '
grunted conroy , between <unk> of tobacco .
'better than nothing , ' said miss henschil ; but for a while they felt ashamed , yet with the comfort of children punished together .
'now , ' she whispered , 'who were you when you were a man ? '
conroy told her , and in return she gave him her history .
it delighted them both to deal once more in worldly concerns  families , names , places , and dates  with a person of understanding .
she came , she said , of <unk> folk  wealthy <unk> , who still kept the broadened a and <unk> <unk> of the old stock .
she lived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of lancaster gate , where people in society gave parties at a mecca called the <unk> hotel .
she herself had been launched into society there , and the flowers at the ball had cost <unk> pounds ; but , being reckoned peculiar , she had made few friends among her own sex .
she had attracted many men , for she was a beauty  the beauty , in fact , of society , she said .
she spoke utterly without shame or <unk> , as a <unk> tells his past to a <unk> ; and conroy nodded across the <unk> .
'do you remember when you got into the carriage ? '
she asked .
' ( oh , i wish i had some knitting ! )
did you notice aught , lad ? '
conroy thought back .
it was ages since .
'was n't there some one outside the door  crying ? '
he asked .
'he 's  he 's the little man i was engaged to , ' she said .
'but i made him break it off .
i told him 't was no good .
but he wo n't , yo ' see . '
<unk> fellow ?
why , he does n't come up to your shoulder . '
'that 's naught to do with it .
i think all the world of him .
i 'm a foolish wench '  her speech wandered as she settled herself <unk> , one elbow on the <unk> .
'we 'd been engaged  i could n't help that  and he worships the ground i tread on .
but it 's no use .
i 'm not responsible , you see .
his two sisters are against it , though i 've the money .
they're right , but they think it 's the <unk> , ' she drawled .
<unk> <unk>  the <unk> .
you see , their grandfather that started the <unk> mills , he died o ' the <unk> . '
'i see , ' said conroy .
the grave face before him under the lifted veil was troubled .
<unk> skinner . '
she breathed it softly .
'i 'd make him a good wife , by god 's <unk>  if i could .
but it 's no use .
i 'm not responsible .
but he 'll not take " no " for an answer .
i used to call him " <unk> . "
he 's of no consequence , yo ' see . '
'that 's in dickens , ' said conroy , quite quickly .
'i have n't thought of <unk> for years .
he was at doctor <unk> 's . '
'and so  that 's my trouble , ' she concluded , ever so slightly wringing her hands .
'but i  do n't you think  there 's <name> now ? '
<unk> ? '
said conroy .
'oh yes !
this is the first time i 've turned my corner without help .
with your help , i should say . '
'it 'll come back , though . '
'then shall we meet it in the same way ?
here 's my card .
write me your train , and we 'll go together . '
'yes .
we must do that .
but between times  when we want  ' she looked at her palm , the four fingers working on it .
'it 's hard to give 'em up . '
'but think what we have gained already , and let me have the case to keep . '
she shook her head , and threw her cigarette out of the window .
'not yet . '
'then let 's lend our cases to nurse , and we 'll get through to-day on cigarettes .
i 'll call her while we feel strong . '
she hesitated , but yielded at last , and nurse accepted the offerings with a smile .
<unk> be all right , ' she said to miss henschil .
'but if i were you '  to conroy  'i 'd take strong exercise . '
when they reached their destination conroy set himself to obey nurse blaber .
he had no remembrance of that day , except one streak of blue sea to his left , <unk> to his right , and , before him , a <unk> track marked with <unk> stones that he counted up to the far thousands .
as he returned to the little town he saw miss henschil on the beach below the cliffs .
she kneeled at nurse blaber 's feet , weeping and pleading .
* * * * * twenty-five days later a telegram came to conroy 's rooms : <unk> given .
waterloo again .
<unk> .
' that same evening he was wakened by the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth .
yet he reflected on his pillow that he had , in spite of lapses , snatched something like three weeks of life , which included several rides on a horse before breakfast  the hour one most <unk> <unk> ; five consecutive evenings on the river at <unk> in a tub where he had well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at ; a game of <unk> at his club ; three dinners , one small dance , and one human flirtation with a human woman .
more notable still , he had settled his month 's accounts , only once confusing petty cash with the days of <name> allowed him .
next morning he rode his hired beast in the park <unk> .
he saw miss henschil on <unk> near lancaster gate , talking to a young man at the railings .
she wheeled and cantered toward him .
'by jove !
how well you look ! '
he cried , without salutation .
'i didn't know you rode . '
'i used to once , ' she replied .
'i 'm all soft now . '
they swept off together down the ride .
'your beast pulls , ' he said .
<unk> him to .
<unk> me something to think of .
how 've you been ? '
she panted .
'i wish <unk> ' shops had n't red lights . '
'have you slipped out and bought some , then ? '
'you do n't know <unk> .
eh , but it 's good to be on a horse again !
this chap cost me two hundred . '
'then you 've been swindled , ' said conroy .
'i know it , but it 's no odds .
i must go back to <unk> and send him away .
he 's neglecting his work for me . '
she swung her <unk> animal on his none too sound <unk> .
<unk> come , lad ? '
'yes .
but i 'm not minding it so much this time . '
<unk> , then  and god help us ! '
she thundered back to the little <unk> figure that waited faithfully near the gate .
conroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home .
that evening he went out with a man in a pair oar , and was rowed to a standstill .
but the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five minutes longer .
* * * * * he carried his bag all down number 3 platform at waterloo , and hove it with one hand into the rack .
'well done ! '
said nurse blaber , in the corridor .
'we 've improved too . '
dr. <name> and an older man came out of the next compartment .
<unk> ! '
said <name> .
'why have n't you been to see me , mr. conroy ?
come under the lamp .
take off your hat .
no  no .
sit , you young giant .
<unk> good .
look here a minute , <name> . '
a little , <unk> , <unk> person glared at him .
<unk> was right about the beauty of the beast , ' he muttered .
'd'you keep it in your glove now ? '
he went on , and punched conroy in the short ribs .
'no , ' said conroy meekly , but without coughing .
<unk>  on my honour !
i 've chucked it for good . '
'wait till you are a sound man before you say that , mr .
conroy . '
sir <name> chartres stumped out , saying to <name> in the corridor , 'it 's all very fine , but the question is shall i or we " sir <unk> of <name> become , " eh ?
we 're bound to think of the children . '
'have you been <unk> ? '
said miss henschil , a few minutes after the train started .
'may i sit with you ?
i  i do n't trust myself yet .
i can't give up as easily as you can , seemingly . '
'ca n't you ?
i never saw any one so improved in a month . '
'look here ! '
she reached across to the rack , single-handed lifted conroy 's bag , and held it at arm 's length .
'i counted ten slowly .
and i did n't think of hours or minutes , ' she boasted .
'do n't remind me , ' he cried .
'ah !
now i 've reminded myself .
i wish i had n't .
do you think it 'll be easier for us to-night ? '
'oh , do n't . '
the smell of the carriage had brought back all his last trip to him , and conroy moved uneasily .
'i 'm sorry .
i 've brought some games , ' she went on .
<unk> and cards  but they all mean counting .
i wish i 'd brought chess , but i can't play chess .
what can we do ?
talk about something . '
'well , how 's <unk> , to begin with ? '
said conroy .
'why ?
did you see him on the platform ? '
'no .
was he there ?
i did n't notice . '
'oh yes .
he does n't understand .
he 's desperately jealous .
i told him it does n't matter .
<name> you please let me hold your hand ?
i believe i'm beginning to get the chill . '
<unk> ought to envy me , ' said conroy .
'he does .
he paid you a high compliment the other night .
he 's taken to calling again  in spite of all they say . '
conroy inclined his head .
he felt cold , and knew surely he would be colder .
'he said , ' she yawned .
' ( beg your pardon . )
he said he could n't see how i could help falling in love with a man like you ; and he called himself a damned little rat , and he beat his head on the piano last night . '
'the piano ?
you play , then ? '
'only to him .
he thinks the world of my accomplishments .
then i told him i would n't have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only the <unk>  not with a million in each stocking . '
'no , not with a million in each stocking , ' said conroy vehemently .
'is n't that odd ? '
'i suppose so  to any one who does n't know .
well , where was i ?
oh , <name> as good as told me i was deceiving him , and he wanted to go away without saying good-night .
he hates standing <unk> , but he must if i wo n't sit down . '
conroy would have smiled , but the chill that <unk> the coming of the <unk> was upon him , and his hand closed warningly on hers .
'and  and so  ' she was trying to say , when her hour also overtook her , leaving alive only the <unk> eyes that turned to conroy .
hand froze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the blackness that heralded it .
yet through the worst conroy saw , at an <unk> distance , one minute glint of light in his night .
thither would he go and escape his fear ; and behold , that light was the light in the watch-tower of her eyes , where her locked soul signalled to his soul : 'look at me ! '
in time , from him and from her , the thing sheered aside , that each soul might step down and resume its own concerns .
he thought confusedly of people on the skirts of a thunderstorm , withdrawing from windows where the torn night is , to their known and furnished beds .
then he dozed , till in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand .
'that 's all .
the faces have n't come , ' he heard her say .
'all  thank god !
i do n't feel even i need what <unk> promised me .
do you ? '
'no . '
he rubbed his eyes .
'but do n't make too sure . '
'certainly not .
we shall have to try again next month .
i 'm afraid it <name> be an awful nuisance for you . '
'not to me , i assure you , ' said conroy , and they leaned back and laughed at the flatness of the words , after the hells through which they had just risen .
'and now , ' she said , strict eyes on conroy , <unk> would n't you take me  not with a million in each stocking ? '
'i do n't know .
that 's what i 've been puzzling over . '
'so have i .
we 're as handsome a couple as i 've ever seen .
are you well off , lad ? '
'they call me so , ' said conroy , smiling .
'that 's north country . '
she laughed again .
setting aside my good looks and yours , i 've four thousand a year of my own , and the rents should make it six .
that 's a match some old cats would lap tea all night to <unk> up . '
'it is .
lucky <unk> ! '
said conroy .
'ay , ' she answered , 'he 'll be the <unk> lad in london if i win through .
who 's yours ? '
'no  no one , dear .
i 've been in hell for years .
i only want to get out and be alive and  so on .
is n't that reason enough ? '
'maybe , for a man .
but i never minded things much till <name> came .
i was all <unk> like . '
'so was i , but now i think i can live .
it ought to be less next month , ought n't it ? '
he said .
'i <name> so .
ye-es .
there 's nothing much for a maid except to be married , and i ask no more .
whoever yours is , when you 've found her , she shall have a wedding present from mrs. <name> skinner that  ' 'but she would n't understand it any more than <unk> . '
'he does n't matter  except to me .
i ca n't keep my eyes open , thank god !
good-night , lad . '
conroy followed her with his eyes .
beauty there was , <name> there was , strength , and enough of the rest to drive better men than <name> skinner to beat their heads on <unk>  but for the new-found life of him conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to <unk> .
he put up his feet and fell asleep , dreaming of a joyous , normal world recovered  with interest on arrears .
there were many things in it , but no one face of any one woman .
* * * * * thrice afterward they took the same train , and each time their trouble shrank and weakened .
miss henschil talked of <unk> , his multiplied calls , the things he had said to his sisters , the much worse things his sisters had replied ; of the late ( he seemed very dead to them ) m. <unk> 's gifts for the <unk> ; of shopping , of house rents , and the cost of really artistic furniture and linen .
conroy explained the exercises in which he delighted  mighty labours of play undertaken against other mighty men , till he sweated and , having bathed , slept .
he had visited his mother , too , in <unk> , and he talked something of her and of the <unk> , which his body , cut out of all clean life for five years , innocently and deeply enjoyed .
nurse blaber was a little interested in conroy 's mother , but , as a rule , she smoked her cigarette and read her <unk> novels in her own compartment .
on their last trip she volunteered to sit with them , and buried herself in the <unk> and the hearth while they whispered together .
on that occasion ( it was near salisbury ) at two in the morning , when the <unk> brushed them with his wing , it meant no more than that they should cease talk for the instant , and for the instant hold hands , as even utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot .
'but still , ' said nurse blaber , not looking up , 'i think your mr. skinner might feel jealous of all this . '
'it would be difficult to explain , ' said conroy .
'then you 'd better not be at my wedding , ' miss henschil laughed .
'after all we 've gone through , too .
but i suppose you ought to leave me out .
is the day fixed ? '
he cried .
<unk> of <name>  in spite of both his sisters .
i can risk it now . '
her face was glorious as she flushed .
'my dear chap ! '
he shook hands unreservedly , and she gave back his grip without <unk> .
'i ca n't tell you how pleased i am ! '
<unk> heavens ! '
said nurse blaber , in a new voice .
'oh , i beg your pardon .
i forgot i was n't paid to be surprised . '
'what at ?
oh , i see ! '
miss henschil explained to conroy .
'she expected you were going to kiss me , or i was going to kiss you , or something . '
'after all you 've gone through , as mr. conroy said , ' 'but i could n't , could you ? '
said miss henschil , with a disgust as <name> as that on conroy 's face .
'it would be horrible  horrible .
and yet , of course , you 're wonderfully handsome .
how d'you account for it , <unk> ? '
nurse blaber shook her head .
'i was hired to cure you of a habit , dear .
when you 're cured i shall go on to the next case  that <unk> one at <unk> i told you about . '
'and i shall be left alone with <name> !
but suppose it is n't cured , ' said miss henschil of a sudden .
suppose it comes back again .
what can i do ?
i ca n't send for him in this way when i 'm a married woman ! '
she pointed like an infant .
'i 'd come , of course , ' conroy answered .
'but , seriously , that is a consideration . '
they looked at each other , alarmed and anxious , and then toward nurse blaber , who closed her book , marked the place , and turned to face them .
'have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me ? '
she said .
'no .
i might have spoken to dad  but mother 's different .
what d'you mean ? '
'and you 've never talked to your mother either , mr .
conroy ? '
'not till i took <unk> .
then i told her it was my heart .
there 's no need to say anything , now that i 'm practically over it , is there ? '
'not if it does n't come back , but  ' she beckoned with a stumpy , triumphant linger that <name> their heads close together .
'you know i always go in and read a chapter to mother at tea , child . '
'i know you do .
you 're an <name> , ' miss henschil patted the blue shoulder next her .
<unk> 's church of england now , ' she explained .
'but she 'll have her bible with her <unk> at tea every night like the <unk> . '
'it was <unk> and <unk> last tuesday that gave me a clue .
i said i'd never seen a case of <unk> , and your mother said she 'd seen too many . '
'where ?
she never told me , ' miss henschil began .
'a few months before you were born  on her trip to australia  at <unk> or <unk> something or other .
it took me three evenings to get it all out . '
'ay  mother 's suspicious of questions , ' said miss henschil to conroy .
'she 'll lock the door of every room she 's in , if it 's but for five minutes .
she was a <unk> from <unk> way , yo ' see . '
'she described your men to the life  men with faces all eaten away , staring at her over the fence of a <unk> ' hospital in this <unk> island .
they begged from her , and she ran , she told me , all down the street , back to the pier .
one touched her and she nearly fainted .
she 's ashamed of that still . '
'my men ?
the sand and the fences ? '
miss henschil muttered .
'yes .
you know how tidy she is and how she hates wind .
she remembered that the fences were broken  she remembered the wind blowing .
sand  sun  salt wind  fences  faces  i got it all out of her , bit by bit .
you do n't know what i know !
and it all happened three or four months before you were born .
there ! '
nurse blaber slapped her knee with her little hand triumphantly .
'would that account for it ? '
miss henschil shook from head to foot .
<unk> .
i do n't care who you ask !
you never imagined the thing .
it was laid on you .
it happened on earth to you !
quick , mr. conroy , she 's too heavy for me !
i 'll get the flask . '
miss henschil leaned forward and collapsed , as conroy told her afterwards , like a factory chimney .
she came out of her swoon with teeth that chattered on the cup .
'no  no , ' she said , <unk> .
'it 's not hysterics .
yo ' see i 've no call to hev 'em any more .
no call  no reason whatever .
god be praised !
can't yo ' feel i 'm a right woman now ? '
'stop hugging me ! '
said nurse blaber .
'you do n't know your strength .
finish the <name> and water .
it 's perfectly reasonable , and i 'll lay long odds mr. conroy 's case is something of the same .
i 've been thinking  ' 'i wonder  ' said conroy , and pushed the girl back as she swayed again .
nurse blaber smoothed her pale hair .
'yes .
your trouble , or something like it , happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you .
ask her , child .
ask her and be done with it once for all . '
'i <name> , ' said conroy ... . 'there ought to be  ' he opened his bag and hunted breathlessly .
<unk> you !
oh , god bless you , <unk> ! '
miss henschil was sobbing .
'you do n't know what this means to me .
it takes it all off  from the beginning . '
'but does n't it make any difference to you now ? '
the nurse asked curiously .
'now that you 're rightfully a woman ? '
conroy , busy with his bag , had not heard .
miss henschil stared across , and her beauty , freed from the shadow of any fear , blazed up within her .
'i see what you mean , ' she said .
'but it has n't changed anything .
i want <unk> .
he has never been out of his mind in his life  except over silly me . '
'it 's all right , ' said conroy , stooping under the lamp , bradshaw in hand .
'if i change at <unk>  for bristol ( bristol  <unk>  yes )  i can be with mother for breakfast in her room and find out . '
<unk> , then , ' said nurse blaber .
'we 've passed <unk> quite a while .
you 'd better take some of our sandwiches . '
she went out to get them .
conroy and miss henschil would have danced , but there is no room for giants in a south-western compartment .
'good-bye , good luck , lad .
eh , but you 've changed already  like me .
send a wire to our hotel as soon as you 're sure , ' said miss henschil .
'what should i have done without you ? '
'or i ? '
said conroy .
'but it 's nurse that 's saving us really . '
'then thank her , ' said miss henschil , looking straight at him .
'yes , i would .
she 'd like it . '
when nurse blaber came back after the parting at <unk> her nose and her eyelids were red , but , for all that , her face reflected a great light even while she sniffed over the <unk> and the hearth .
miss henschil , deep in a house <unk> 's catalogue , did not speak for twenty minutes .
then she said , between adding <unk> of best , guest , and servants ' sheets , 'but why should our times have been the same , <unk> ? '
'because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock , ' nurse blaber answered .
'and besides that , you probably set each other off by talking and thinking about it .
you should n't , you know . '
'ay , but you 've never been in hell , ' said miss henschil .
the telegram handed in at <unk> at <unk> and delivered to miss henschil on the beach of a certain village at <unk> ran thus : ' " absolutely confirmed .
she says she remembers hearing noise of accident in engine-room returning from <name> <unk> " ' 'he means the year , not the thermometer , ' said nurse blaber , throwing pebbles at the cold sea .
' " and two men scalded thus explaining my <unk> " ( the idea of telling me that ! )
" subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up behind her calling for joke , <unk> , all is lost , ' thus accounting very <unk> " ' nurse blaber purred audibly .
' " she says only remembers being upset minute or two .
unspeakable relief .
best love <unk> , who is <name> .
get out of her what she would like <unk> " oh , i ought n't to have read that , ' said miss henschil .
'it does n't matter .
i do n't want anything , ' said nurse blaber , 'and if i did i should n't get it . '
<unk> all <unk> there was darkness under heaven for an hour 's space  darkness that we knew was given us for special <name> .
sun and moon and stars were hid , god had left his throne , when <name> came to me , she did , <name> all alone !
side by side ( because our fate damned us ere our birth ) we stole out of <unk> gate looking for the earth .
hand in pulling hand amid fear no dreams have known , <name> ran with me , she did , <name> all alone !
when the horror passing speech hunted us along , each laid hold on each , and each found the other strong .
in the teeth of things forbid and reason overthrown , <name> stood by me , she did , <name> all alone !
when , at last , we heard the fires dull and die away , when , at last , our linked desires dragged us up to day , when , at last , our souls were rid of what that night had shown , <name> passed from me , she did , <name> all alone !
let her go and find a mate , as i <name> find a bride , knowing naught of <unk> gate or who are penned inside .
there is knowledge god forbid more than one should own .
so <name> went from me , she did , oh my soul , be glad she did !
<name> all alone !
the honours of war ( <unk> ) a hooded motor had followed mine from the <unk> road up the drive to the infant 's ancestral hall , and had turned off to the stables .
'we 're having a quiet evening together .
stalky 's upstairs changing .
dinner 's at <unk> sharp , because we 're hungry .
his room 's next to yours , ' said the infant , nursing a <unk> bottle of burgundy .
then i found lieutenant-colonel <unk> .
corkran , <unk> , who borrowed a <unk> and told me about the east and his sikh regiment .
'and are your subalterns as good as ever ? '
i asked .
<unk> '  simply amazin ' !
all i 've got to do is to find 'em jobs .
they keep <unk> ' their caps to me and askin ' for more work .
'come at me with their tongues hangin ' out .
i used to run the other way at their age . '
'and when they err ? '
said i .
'i suppose they do sometimes ? '
'then they run to me again to weep with remorse over their virgin <unk> .
i never <unk> my colonel when i was in trouble .
lambs  positive lambs ! '
'and what do you say to 'em ? '
<unk> to 'em like a papa .
tell 'em how i ca n't understand it , an ' how shocked i am , and how grieved their parents 'll be ; and throw in a little about the army regulations and the ten commandments .
<unk> one feel rather a sweep when one thinks of what one used to do at their age .
d'you remember  ' we remembered together till close on seven o'clock .
as we went out into the gallery that runs round the big hall , we saw the infant , below , talking to two deferential <unk> lads whom i had known , on and off , in the holidays , any time for the last ten years .
one of them had a bruised cheek , and the other a weeping left eye .
'yes , that 's the style , ' said stalky below his breath .
'they 're brought up on <unk> and <unk> text-books .
i say , the girls we knew must have been much better than they pretended they were ; for i 'll swear it is n't the fathers . '
'but why on earth did you do it ? '
the infant was shouting .
'you know what it means nowadays . '
'well , sir , ' said <name> <unk> , the taller of the two , <unk> talks too much , for one thing .
he did n't join till he was twenty-three , and , besides that , he used to lecture on tactics in the ante-room .
he said <unk> was the only <unk> , and he illustrated his theories with <unk> .
he was that sort of chap , sir . '
'and he did n't much care whose <unk> they were , ' said eames , who was shorter and <unk> .
'and then he would talk about the <unk> , ' said <name> .
'he got a degree there .
and he told us we were n't intellectual .
he told the adjutant so , sir .
he was just that kind of chap , sir , if you understand . '
stalky and i backed behind a tall japanese jar of <unk> and listened more intently .
'was all the mess in it , or only you two ? '
the infant demanded , chewing his moustache .
'the adjutant went to bed , of course , sir , and the senior subaltern said he was n't going to risk his commission  they 're awfully down on <unk> nowadays in the service  but the rest of us  er  attended to him , ' said <name> .
<unk> ? '
the infant asked .
the boys smiled <unk> .
'not in the ante-room , sir , ' said eames .
'then he called us silly children , and went to bed , and we sat up <unk> ' , and i suppose we got a bit above ourselves , and we  er  ' <unk> to his quarters and <name> him ? '
the infant suggested .
'well , we only asked him to get out of bed , and we put his helmet and <unk> on for him , and we <name> him bits out of the blue <name> book  the <unk> on army organisation .
oh yes , and then we asked him to drink old <unk> 's health , as a <unk> , in <unk> and worcester sauce , and so on .
we had to help him a little there .
he bites .
there was n't much else that time ; but , you know , the war office is severe on <unk> these days . '
<name> stopped with a <unk> smile .
'and then , ' eames went on , 'then wontner said we 'd done several <unk> worth of damage to his furniture . '
'oh , ' said the infant , 'he 's that kind of man , is he ?
does he brush his teeth ? '
'oh yes , he 's quite clean all over ! '
said <unk> ; 'but his father 's a wealthy barrister . '
<unk> , ' eames corrected , 'and so this mister wontner is out for our blood .
he 's going to make a first-class row about it  appeal to the war office  court of inquiry  <unk> bits in the papers , and songs in the <unk> .
he told us so . '
'that 's the sort of chap he is , ' said <unk> .
'and that means old <unk> , our colonel , 'll be put on <unk> , same as that case in the <unk> ' mess ; and our adjutant 'll have to exchange , like it was with that fellow in the <unk> dragoons , and there 'll be misery all round .
he means making it too hot for us , and his papa 'll back him . '
'yes , that 's all very fine , ' said the infant ; 'but i left the service about the time you were born , <name> .
what 's it got to do with me ? '
<unk> told me i was always to go to you when i was in trouble , and you 've been awfully good to me since he ... ' 'better stay to dinner . '
the infant mopped his forehead .
'thank you very much , but the fact is  ' <unk> halted .
'this afternoon , about four , to be exact  ' eames broke in .
'we went over to wontner 's quarters to talk things over .
the row only happened last night , and we found him writing letters as hard as he could to his father  getting up his case for the war office , you know .
he read us some of 'em , but i 'm not a good judge of style .
we tried to ride him off quietly  apologies and so forth  but it was the <unk> and <unk> that defeated us . '
'yes , he was n't taking anything except pure revenge , ' said eames .
'he said he 'd make an example of the regiment , and he was particularly glad that he 'd landed our colonel .
he told us so .
old <unk> don't sympathise with wontner 's <unk> lectures .
he says wontner ought to learn manners first , but we thought  ' <unk> turned to eames , who was less a son of the house than himself , eames 's father being still alive .
'then , ' eames went on , 'he became rather <unk> , and we thought we might as well <unk> the correspondence '  he wrinkled his swelled left eye  'and after that , we got him to take a seat in my car . '
'he was in a sack , you know , ' <unk> explained .
'he would n't go any other way .
but we did n't hurt him . '
'oh no !
his head 's sticking out quite clear , and '  eames rushed the fence  'we 've put him in your garage  er <unk> <unk> . '
'my garage ! '
infant 's voice nearly broke with horror .
'well , father always told me if i was in trouble , uncle <name>  ' <name> 's sentence died away as the infant collapsed on a <unk> and said no more than , 'your commissions ! '
there was a long , long silence .
'what price your <unk> <unk> subaltern ? '
i whispered to stalky behind my hand .
his nostrils expanded , and he drummed on the edge of the japanese jar with his knuckles .
<unk> your father , <name> ! '
the infant groaned .
<unk> 's a criminal offence these days .
it is n't as if  ' 'come on , ' said stalky .
'that was my old line battalion in egypt .
they nearly slung old <unk> and me out of the service in <unk> for <unk> . '
he descended the stairs and the infant rolled appealing eyes at him .
'i heard what you youngsters have confessed , ' he began ; and in his <unk> voice , which is almost as musical as his singing one , he <unk> those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a revelation to listen to .
till then they had known him almost as a relative  we were all brevet , deputy , or acting uncles to the <unk> friends ' brood  a sympathetic elder brother , sound on finance .
they had never met colonel <unk> .
corkran in the chair of justice .
and while he flayed and rent and blistered , and wiped the floor with them , and while they looked for hiding-places and found none on that floor , i remembered ( 1 ) the <unk> of <unk> ' <unk> at dalhousie , which came <unk> near a court-martial on <unk> corkran ; ( 2 ) the burning of captain <unk> 's <unk> on a hot indian <name> , when the captain slept in his garden , and lieutenant corkran , smoking , rode by after a successful whist night at the club ; ( 3 ) the introduction of an ekka pony , with ekka attached , into a brother captain 's tent on a frosty night in peshawur , and the removal of tent , pole , cot , and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas ; ( 4 ) the bath that was given to <unk> on his own verandah  his <unk> saw it and broke off the engagement , which was what the mess intended , she being an eurasian  and the <unk> all over of <unk> with flour and turmeric from the bazaar .
when he took breath i realised how only satan can rebuke sin .
the good do n't know enough .
'now , ' said stalky , 'get out !
no , not out of the house .
go to your rooms . '
'i 'll send your dinner , <name> , ' said the infant .
<unk> ! '
nothing had ever been known to astonish ipps , the butler .
he entered and withdrew with his charges .
after all , he had suffered from <name> since <name> 's twelfth year .
'they 've done everything they could , short of murder , ' said the infant .
'you know what this 'll mean for the regiment .
it is n't as if we were dealing with sahibs nowadays . '
<unk> so . '
stalky turned on me .
'go and release the <unk> , ' he said .
"tis n't my garage , ' i pleaded .
'i 'm company .
besides , he 'll probably slay me .
he 's been in the sack for hours . '
'look here , ' stalky thundered  the years had fallen from us both  'is your  am i <unk> ' or are you ?
we 've got to pull this thing off somehow or other .
cut over to the garage , make much of him , and bring him over .
he 's dining with us .
be quick , you <unk> ass ! '
i was quick enough ; but as i ran through the shrubbery i wondered how one <unk> the subaltern of the present day from a sack without hurting his feelings .
anciently , one slit the end open , taking off his boots first , and then fled .
imagine a <unk> garage , <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> silk <unk> and a <unk> , cheap , hooded <unk> .
in the back seat of this last , conceive a fiery chestnut head emerging from a long <unk> ; an implacable white face , with blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the string that was drawn round its neck .
the effect , under the electrics , was that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon .
'good evening ! '
i said genially .
'let me help you out of that . '
the head glared .
'we 've got 'em , ' i went on .
'they came to quite the wrong shop for this sort of game  quite the wrong shop . '
<unk> ! '
said the head .
'we 'll see about that .
let me out . '
it was not a promising voice for one so young , and , as usual , i had no knife .
'you 've chewed the string so i ca n't find the knot , ' i said as i worked with trembling fingers at the <unk> 's throat .
something untied itself , and mr. wontner wriggled out , <unk> , <unk> , his coat split half down his back , his waistcoat <unk> , his watch-chain snapped , his trousers <unk> well above the knees .
'where , ' he said grimly , as he pulled them down , 'are master <unk> and master eames ? '
<unk> arrested , of course , ' i replied .
'sir <name> '  i gave the <unk> full title as a <unk>  'is a justice of the peace .
he 'd be very pleased if you dined with us .
there 's a room ready for you . '
i picked up the sack .
'd'you know , ' said mr. wontner through his teeth  but the car 's bonnet was between us , 'that this looks to me like  i wo n't say conspiracy yet , but uncommonly like a confederacy . '
when injured souls begin to distinguish and <unk> , danger is over .
so i grew bold .
<unk> you take it that way , ' i said .
'you come here in trouble  ' 'my good fool , ' he interrupted , with a <unk> snort , 'let me assure you that the trouble <name> recoil on the other men ! '
'as you please , ' i went on .
<unk> , the chaps who got you into trouble are arrested , and the magistrate who arrested 'em asks you to dinner .
shall i tell him you 're walking back to <unk> ? '
he picked some fluff off his waistcoat .
'i 'm in no position to dictate terms yet , ' he said .
'that <name> come later .
i must <unk> into this a little further .
in the meantime , i accept your invitation without prejudice  if you understand what that means . '
i understood and began to be happy again .
<unk> without prejudices were quite new to me .
'all right , ' i replied ; 'if you 'll go up to the house , i 'll turn out the lights . '
he walked off stiffly , while i searched the sack and the car for the <unk> correspondence that <name> had talked of .
i found nothing except , as the police reports say , the trace of a struggle .
he had kicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat , and had bitten the leather <unk> where he could reach it .
evidently a <unk> and <unk> young gentleman .
'well done ! '
said stalky at the door .
'so he did n't slay you .
stop laughing .
he 's talking to the infant now about <unk> .
look here , you 're nearest his size .
cut up to your rooms and give ipps your dinner things and a clean shirt for him . '
'but i have n't got another suit , ' i said .
'you !
i 'm not thinking of you !
we 've got to conciliate him .
he 's in filthy rags and a filthy temper , and he wo n't feel decent till he's dressed .
you 're the sacrifice .
be quick !
and clean socks , remember ! '
once more i trotted up to my room , changed into <unk> <unk> grey <unk> , put studs into a clean shirt , dug out fresh socks , handed the whole <unk> over to ipps , and returned to the hall just in time to hear stalky say , 'i 'm a <unk> , but i have the honour to hold his majesty 's commission in a territorial battalion . '
then i felt as though i might be beginning to be repaid .
'i have a very high opinion of the <unk> myself , ' said mr. wontner above a glass of <name> .
( infant never lets us put <unk> into anything above twenty years old . )
'but if you had any experience of the service , you would find that the average army man  ' here the infant suggested changing , and ipps , before whom no human passion can assert itself , led mr. wontner away .
'why the devil did you tell him i was on the bench ? '
said infant wrathfully to me .
'you know i ai n't now .
why did n't he stay in his father 's office ?
he 's a raging blight ! '
'not a bit of it , ' said stalky cheerfully .
'he 's a little shaken and excited .
probably beetle annoyed him in the garage , but we must overlook that .
we 've contained him so far , and i 'm going to nibble round his outposts at dinner .
all you 've got to do , infant , is to remember you're a gentleman in your own house .
do n't hop !
you 'll find it pretty difficult before dinner 's over .
i do n't want to hear anything at all from you , beetle . '
'but i 'm just beginning to like him , ' i said .
'do let me play ! '
'not till i ask you .
you 'll <unk> it .
poor old <unk> !
a scandal 'ud break him up ! '
'but as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it , it 's bound to rag , ' infant began .
'why  why , they varnished me when i joined ! '
he squirmed at the thought of it .
'do n't be owls !
we ai n't discussing principles !
we 've got to save the court of inquiry if we can , ' said stalky .
five minutes later  at <unk> to be precise  we four sat down to such a dinner as , i hold , only the infant 's cook can produce , with wines worthy of <unk> banquets .
a man in the extremity of rage and injured dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient .
he asks no questions , accepts what is put before him , and <unk> in one key  very often of trifles .
but food and drink are the very best of drugs .
i think it was <unk> dry <unk> <unk>  stalky as usual stuck to burgundy  that began to unlock mr. wontner 's heart behind my <unk> .
me he snubbed throughout , after the oxford manner , because i had seen him in the sack , and he did not intend me to presume ; but to stalky and the infant , while i admired the set of my <unk> across his shoulders , he made his plans of revenge very clear indeed .
he had even sketched out some of the paragraphs that were to appear in the papers , and if stalky had allowed me to speak , i would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased .
'you ought to be able to get <unk> ' damages out of 'em , into the bargain , ' said stalky , after mr. wontner had outlined his position legally .
'my <unk> sir , ' mr. wontner applied himself to his glass , 'it is n't a matter that gentlemen usually discuss , but , i assure you , we <unk> '  he waved a well-kept hand  'do not stand in any need of filthy <unk> . '
in the next three minutes , we learned exactly what his father was worth , which , as he pointed out , was a trifle no man of the world dwelt on .
stalky envied aloud , and i delivered my first kick at the infant 's ankle .
thence we drifted to education , and the average army man , and the desolating <unk>  i remember these words  of army society , notably among its <unk> .
it appeared there was some sort of narrow convention in the army against mentioning a woman 's name at mess .
we were much surprised at this  stalky would not let me express my surprise  but we took it from mr. wontner , who said we might , that it was so .
next he touched on colonels of the old school , and their <unk> of tactics .
not that he himself pretended to any skill in tactics , but after three years at the <unk>  none of us had had a <unk> education  a man insensibly contracted the habit of clear thinking .
at least , he could automatically <unk> his ideas , and the jealousy of these <unk> colonels was inconceivable .
we would understand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his colonel , who had been in the conspiracy against him ; to make his adjutant resign or exchange ; and to give the half-dozen childish subalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in other corps  west african ones , he hoped .
for himself , after the case was decided , he proposed to go on living in the regiment , just to prove  for he bore no malice  that times had changed , <unk> <unk> in <unk>  if we knew what that meant .
infant had curled his legs out of reach , so i was quite free to return thanks yet once more to allah for the diversity of his creatures in his adorable world .
and so , by way of an <unk> <unk> <name> , to tactics and the great general <unk> , unknown to the average army man .
here the infant , at a whisper from ipps  whose face had darkened like a mulberry while he waited  excused himself and went away , but stalky , colonel of <unk> , wanted some tips on tactics .
he got them <unk> for ten minutes  wontner and <unk> mixed , but wontner in a film of priceless <unk> distinctly on top .
when the infant came back , he renewed his <unk> demand that infant should take his <unk> .
i supposed this to be a family trait of the <unk> , whom i had been <unk> for some time past even to the third generation .
'but , <name> it all , they 're both asleep ! '
said infant , scowling at me .
<unk> let 'em have the <unk> port . '
<unk> ! '
said stalky , rising at once .
'i do n't see that makes any difference .
as a matter of form , you 'd better identify them .
i 'll show you the way . '
we followed up the white stone <unk> that leads to the bachelors ' wing .
mr. wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in the <unk> .
'oh , a chap 's assumed to be innocent until he 's proved guilty , ' said stalky , mounting step by step .
'how did they get you into the sack , mr .
wontner ? '
<unk> on me from behind  two to one , ' said mr. wontner briefly .
'i think i handed each of them something first , but they roped my arms and legs . '
'and did they photograph you in the sack ? '
'good heavens , no ! '
mr. wontner shuddered .
'that 's lucky .
awful thing to live down  a photograph , is n't it ? '
said stalky to me as we reached the landing .
'i 'm thinking of the newspapers , of course . '
'oh , but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from accounts supplied by <unk> , ' i said .
mr. wontner turned him round .
it was the first time he had honoured me by his notice since our talk in the garage .
'ah , ' said he , 'do you pretend to any special knowledge in these matters ? '
'i 'm a journalist by profession , ' i answered simply but nobly .
'as soon as you 're at <name> , i 'd like to have your account of the affair . '
now i thought he would have loved me for this , but he only replied in an uncomfortable , <unk> voice , 'oh , you would , would you ? '
'not if it 's any trouble , of course , ' i said .
'i can always get their version from the <unk> .
do either of 'em draw or sketch at all , mr. wontner ?
or perhaps your father might  ' then he said quite hotly , 'i wish you to understand very clearly , my good man , that a gentleman 's name ca n't be dragged through the gutter to <unk> up the circulation of your wretched sheet , whatever it may be . '
'it is   ' i named a journal of enormous sales which <unk> in <unk> , military , and other <unk> .
'i do n't know yet what it ca n't do , mr .
wontner . '
'i did n't know that i was dealing with a reporter ' said mr. wontner .
we were all halted outside a shut door .
ipps had followed us .
'but surely you want it in the papers , do n't you ? '
i urged .
'with a scandal like this , one could n't , in justice to the democracy , be exclusive .
we 'd syndicate it here and in the united states .
i helped you out of the sack , if you remember . '
'i wish to goodness you 'd stop talking ! '
he snapped , and sat down on a chair .
stalky 's hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action , but i felt that my fire had not been <unk> .
'i 'll answer for him , ' said stalky to wontner , in an undertone that dropped to a whisper .
i caught  'not without my leave  dependent on me for <unk> , ' and other gratifying <unk> to my integrity .
still mr. wontner sat in his chair , and still we waited on him .
the infant 's face showed worry and heavy grief ; stalky 's , a bright and <unk> interest ; mine was hidden behind his shoulders , but on the face of ipps were written emotions that no butler should <name> towards any guest .
contempt and wrath were the least of them .
and mr. wontner was looking full at ipps , as ipps was looking at him .
mr. <unk> father , i understood , kept a butler and two footmen .
'd'you suppose they 're <unk> , in order to get off ? '
he said at last .
ipps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open .
the boys had finished their dinner and were fast asleep  one on a sofa , one in a long chair  their faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood .
they had had a <unk> night , a hard day , that ended with a <unk> from an artist , and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life .
what else should youth do , then , but eat , and drink <unk> port , and remember their sorrows no more ?
mr. wontner looked at them severely , ipps within easy reach , his hands quite ready .
<unk> , ' said mr. wontner at last .
<unk> but necessary .
er  have you such a thing as a rope on the premises , and a sack  two sacks and two ropes ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't resist the temptation .
that man understands , does n't he , that this is a private matter ? '
'that man , ' who was me , was off to the basement like one of infant 's own <unk> .
the stables gave me what i wanted , and coming back with it through a dark passage , i ran squarely into ipps .
'go on ! '
he grunted .
'the minute he lays hands on master <name> , master <name> 's saved .
but that person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted .
it was <unk> with me all the time from the soup down , i assure you . '
i arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes .
'they were two to one with me , ' said mr. wontner , as he took them .
'if they wake  ' 'we 'll stand by , ' stalky replied .
'two to one is quite fair . '
but the boys hardly grunted as mr. wontner roped first one and then the other .
even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled , with rolling heads , through sticky lips , and snored on .
<unk> ? '
said mr. wontner <unk> .
<unk> exhaustion .
they are n't much more than kids , after all .
what's next ? '
said stalky .
'i want to take 'em away with me , please . '
stalky looked at him with respect .
'i 'll have my car round in five minutes , ' said the infant .
<unk> 'll help <name> 'em downstairs , ' and he shook mr. wontner by the hand .
we were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a <unk> in the hall , and the boys waked and began to realise what had happened .
<unk> ! '
said mr. wontner , with the simplicity of twelve years old .
<unk> scored now ? '
and he sat upon them .
the tension broke in a storm of laughter , led , i think , by ipps .
<unk>  absolutely <unk> ! '
said mr. wontner , with folded arms from his lively chair .
but he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it all with quite a <unk> grin , as we rolled and stamped round him , and wiped the tears from our cheeks .
<unk> it ! '
said <name> <unk> .
'we 're defeated ! '
'by tactics , too , ' said eames .
'i did n't think you knew 'em , <unk> .
it 's a fair score .
what are you going to do with us ? '
'take you back to mess , ' said mr. wontner .
'not like this ? '
'oh no .
worse  much worse !
i have n't begun with you yet .
and you thought you 'd scored !
yah ! '
they had scored beyond their wildest dream .
the man in whose hands it lay to shame them , their colonel , their adjutant , their regiment , and their service , had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake of a common or <unk> rag  such a rag as if it came to the ears of the authorities , would cost him his commission .
they were saved , and their saviour was their equal and their brother .
so they chaffed and reviled him as such till he again <unk> the breath out of them , and we others laughed louder than they .
<unk> in ! '
said stalky when the <unk> came round .
'this is the score of the century .
i would n't miss it for a brigade !
we <name> n't be long , infant ! '
i hurried into a coat .
'is there any necessity for that <unk> to come too ? '
said mr. wontner in an unguarded whisper .
'he is n't dressed for one thing . '
<name> and eames wriggled round to look at the reporter , began a joyous bellow , and suddenly stopped .
'what 's the matter ? '
said wontner with suspicion .
'nothing , ' said <name> .
'i die happy , <unk> .
take me up tenderly . '
we packed into the car , bearing our sheaves with us , and for half an hour , as the cool <unk> fanned his thoughtful brow , mr. wontner was quite abreast of himself .
though he said nothing unworthy , he triumphed and trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks .
i sat between them on the back seat , and applauded him <unk> till he reminded me that what i had seen and what he had said was not for publication .
i hinted , while the boys plunged with <name> inside their trappings , that this might be a matter for arrangement .
'then a sovereign <name> n't part us , ' said mr. wontner cheerily , and both boys fell into lively hysterics .
'i do n't see where the joke comes in for you , ' said mr. wontner .
'i thought it was my little <unk> to-night . '
'no , <unk> , ' gasped <name> .
'some is , but not all .
i 'll be good now .
i 'll give you my parole till we get to mess .
i would n't be out of this for a fiver . '
<unk> me , ' said eames , and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or evasion .
'now , i suppose , ' said mr. wontner largely to stalky , as we neared the suburbs of ash , 'you have a good deal of practical joking on the stock exchange , have n't you ? '
'and when were you on the stock exchange , uncle <name> ? '
piped <name> , while eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder .
'i 'm sorry , ' said stalky , 'but the fact is , i command a regiment myself when i 'm at home .
your colonel knows me , i think . '
he gave his name .
mr. wontner seemed to have heard of it .
we had to pick eames off the floor , where he had cast himself from excess of delight .
'oh , heavens ! '
said mr. wontner after a long pause .
'what have i done ?
what have n't i done ? '
we felt the temperature in the car rise as he blushed .
'you did n't talk tactics , <unk> ? '
said <name> .
'oh , say it wasn't tactics , darling ! '
'it was , ' said wontner .
eames was all among our feet again , crying , 'if you do n't let me get my arms up , i 'll be sick .
let 's hear what you said .
tell us . '
but mr. wontner turned to stalky .
'it 's no good my begging your pardon , sir , i suppose , ' he said .
'do n't you notice 'em , ' said stalky .
'it was a fair rag all round , and anyhow , you two youngsters have n't any right to talk tactics .
you've been rolled up , horse , foot , and guns . '
'i 'll make a treaty .
if you 'll let us go and change presently , ' said <name> , 'i 'll promise we wo n't tell about you , <unk> .
you talked tactics to uncle <name> ?
old <unk> <name> like that .
he do n't love you , claus . '
'if i 've made one ass of myself , i shall take extra care to make asses of you ! '
said wontner .
'i want to stop , please , at the next <unk> shop on the right .
it ought to be close here . '
he evidently knew the country even in the dark , for the car stopped at a <unk> <unk> establishment , where  it was saturday evening  a young <name> was clearing up the counter .
i followed him , as a good reporter should .
'have you got  ' he began .
'ah , those 'll do ! '
he pointed to two hairy plush <unk> bonnets , one <unk> , the other a conscientious electric blue .
'how much , please ?
i 'll take them both , and that bunch of peacock feathers , and that red feather thing . '
it was a brilliant <unk> pigeon 's wing .
'now i want some yards of muslin with a nice , fierce pattern , please . '
he got it  yellow with black tulips  and returned heavily laden .
'sorry to have kept you , ' said he .
'now we 'll go to my quarters to change and <unk> . '
we came to them  opposite a dun waste of parade-ground that might have been mian mir  and bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set <unk> echoing .
we hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs , while wontner changed into uniform , but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket .
'what on earth 's that for ? '
said he .
'because you 've been wearing my evening things , ' i said .
'i want to get into 'em again , if you do n't mind . '
'then you are n't a reporter ? '
he said .
'no , ' i said , 'but that <name> n't part us . '
'oh , hurry ! '
cried eames in desperate convulsions .
'we ca n't stand this much longer .
't is n't fair on the young . '
'i 'll attend to you in good time , ' said wontner ; and when he had made careful toilet , he <unk> the bonnets , put the peacock 's feather into the <unk> one , pinned the crimson wing on the blue one , set them daintily on the boys ' heads , and bade them admire the effect in his <unk> while he ripped the muslin into lengths , bound it first , and draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees .
he finished off with a gigantic <unk> , <unk> fashion .
<unk> skirts , ' he explained to stalky , who nodded approval .
next he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk , but with very short steps .
'i ought to have got you white satin slippers , ' he murmured , 'and i 'm sorry there 's no rouge . '
'do n't worry on our account , old man  you 're doing us proud , ' said <name> from under his hat .
'this beats <unk> and <unk> . '
'oh , why did n't we think of these things when we had him at our <name> ? '
eames wailed .
'never mind  we 'll try it on the next chap .
you 've a mind , claus . '
'now we 'll call on 'em at mess , ' said wontner , as they <unk> towards the door .
'i think i 'll call on your colonel , ' said stalky .
'he ought n't to miss this .
your first attempt ?
i assure you i could n't have done it better myself .
thank you ! '
he held out his hand .
'thank you , sir ! '
said wontner , shaking it .
'i 'm more grateful to you than i can say , and  and i 'd like you to believe some time that i 'm not quite as big a  ' 'not in the least , ' stalky interrupted .
'if i were writing a confidential report on you , i should put you down as rather adequate .
look after your <unk> , or they 'll fall ! '
we watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the mess verandah .
there was a noise .
then telephone bells rang , a sergeant and a mess waiter charged out , and the noise grew , till at last the mess was a little noisy .
we came back , ten minutes later , with colonel <unk> , who had been taking his sorrows to bed with him .
the ante-room was quite full and visitors were still arriving , but it was possible to hear oneself speak occasionally .
<unk> and eames , in sack and sash , sat side by side on a table , their hats at a <unk> <name> , <unk> <unk> their tied feet .
in the intervals of singing 'put me among the girls , ' they <unk> <unk> held to their lips by , i regret to say , a <name> .
public opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their costume till they should have danced in it .
wontner , lying more or less gracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns , was lecturing on tactics and imploring to be let down , which he was with a run when they realised that the colonel was there .
then he picked himself up from the sofa and said : 'i want to apologise , sir , to you and the mess for having been such an ass ever since i joined ! '
this was when the noise began .
seeing the night promised to be wet , stalky and i went home again in the infant 's car .
it was some time since we had tasted the hot air that lies between the cornice and the ceiling of crowded rooms .
after half an hour 's silence , stalky said to me : 'i do n't know what you 've been doing , but i believe i 've been <unk> ' .
would you put that down to burgundy or <unk> decay ? '
the children these were our children who died for our lands : they were dear in our sight .
we have only the memory left of their <unk> sayings and laughter .
the price of our loss shall be paid to our hands , not another 's hereafter .
neither the alien nor priest shall decide on it .
that is our right .
but who shall return us the children ?
at the hour the barbarian chose to disclose his <unk> , and raged against man , they engaged , on the breasts that they bared for us , the first <unk> of the sword he had <unk> prepared for us  their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences .
they bought us anew with their blood , forbearing to blame us , those hours which we had not made good when the judgment <unk> us .
they believed us and perished for it .
our <unk> , our learning .
delivered them bound to the pit and alive to the burning whither they <unk> hastened as jostling for honour .
not since her birth has our earth seen such worth loosed upon her .
nor was their agony brief , or once only imposed on them .
the wounded , the <unk> , the sick received no <unk> : being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption , hopeless themselves of relief , till death , marvelling , closed on them .
that flesh we had nursed from the first in all <unk> was given to corruption <unk> and assailed by the malice of heaven  by the <unk> jests of decay where it lolled on the wires  to be blanched or <unk> by fumes  to be <unk> by fires  to be <unk> tossed and <unk> in stale mutilation from crater to crater .
for this we shall take <unk> .
but who shall return us our children ?
the dog <unk> ( <name> 1914 ) my friend attley , who would give away his own head if you told him you had lost yours , was giving away a <unk> litter of <unk> <unk> , and half-a-dozen women were in <unk> at the show on <unk> lawn .
we picked by lot .
mrs. godfrey <name> first choice ; her married daughter , second .
i was third , but <unk> my right because i was already owned by malachi , <name> 's full brother , whom i had brought over in the car to visit his nephews and <unk> , and he would have slain them all if i had taken home one .
<name> , mrs. godfrey 's younger daughter , pounced on my rejection with squeals of delight , and attley turned to a dark , <unk> , <unk> girl , who had come over for tennis , and invited her to pick .
she put on a <unk> that made her look like a camel , knelt clumsily , for she was long from the hip to the knee , breathed hard , and considered the last couple .
'i think i 'd like that <unk> one , ' she said .
'oh , not him , miss sichliffe ! '
attley cried .
'he was overlaid or had sunstroke or something .
they call him the <unk> in the <unk> .
besides , he <unk> . '
'i think that 's rather fetching , ' she answered .
neither malachi nor i had ever seen a <unk> dog before .
'that 's <unk>  st. <unk> 's dance , ' mrs. godfrey put in .
'he ought to have been drowned . '
'but i like his cast of countenance , ' the girl persisted .
'he does n't look a good life , ' i said , 'but perhaps he can be patched up . '
miss sichliffe turned crimson ; i saw mrs. godfrey exchange a glance with her married daughter , and knew i had said something which would have to be lived down .
'yes , ' miss sichliffe went on , her voice shaking , 'he is n't a good life , but perhaps i can  patch him up .
come here , sir . '
the <unk> beast lurched toward her , <unk> down his own nose till he fell over his own toes .
then , luckily , <name> ran across the lawn and reminded malachi of their <unk> .
all that family are as queer as dick's <unk> , and fight like man and wife .
i had to separate them , and mrs. godfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it out in silence .
'd'you know what that girl 's father was ? '
mrs. godfrey asked .
'no , ' i replied .
'i <unk> her for her own sake .
she breathes through her mouth . '
'he was a retired doctor , ' she explained .
'he used to pick up <name> young men in the repentant stage , take them home , and patch them up till they were sound enough to be insured .
then he insured them heavily , and let them out into the world again  with an appetite .
of course , no one knew him while he was alive , but he left pots of money to his daughter . '
<unk> legitimate  highly respectable , ' i said .
'but what a life for the daughter ! '
'must n't it have been !
now d'you realise what you said just now ? '
<unk> ; and now you 've made me quite happy , shall we go back to the house ? '
when we reached it they were all inside , sitting in committee on names .
'what shall you call yours ? '
i heard <name> ask miss sichliffe .
<unk> , ' she replied  <unk> 's sauce , you know .
he 's going to be quite saucy when i 've '  she saw mrs. godfrey and me coming through the french window  'when he 's stronger . '
attley , the well-meaning man , to make me feel at ease , asked what i thought of the name .
'oh , splendid , ' i said at random .
'h with an a , a with an r , r with a  ' 'but that 's little <unk> , ' some one said , and they all laughed .
miss sichliffe , her hands joined across her long knees , drawled , 'you ought always to verify your quotations . '
it was not a kindly thrust , but something in the word <unk> ' set the automatic side of my <name> at work on some shadow of a word or phrase that kept itself out of memory 's reach as a cat sits just beyond a dog 's jump .
when i was going home , miss sichliffe came up to me in the twilight , the pup on a <unk> , swinging her big shoes at the end of her <unk> .
<unk> , ' she said in her thick <unk> voice .
'i 'm sorry for what i said to you about <unk> quotations .
i did n't know you well enough and  anyhow , i ought n't to have . '
'but you were quite right about little <unk> , ' i answered .
'the spelling ought to have reminded me . '
'yes , of course .
it 's the spelling , ' she said , and slouched off with the pup sliding after her .
once again my <name> began to worry after something that would have meant something if it had been properly spelled .
i confided my trouble to malachi on the way home , but <name> had bitten him in four places , and he was busy .
weeks later , attley came over to see me , and before his car stopped malachi let me know that <name> was sitting beside the chauffeur .
he greeted her by the <unk> of the neck as she hopped down ; and i greeted mrs. godfrey , attley , and a big basket .
'you 've got to help me , ' said attley <unk> .
we took the basket into the garden , and there staggered out the angular shadow of a <unk> , <unk> terrier , with one imbecile and one delirious ear , and two most hideous <unk> .
<name> and malachi , already at <unk> on the lawn , saw him , let go , and fled in opposite directions .
'why have you brought that fetid hound here ? '
i demanded .
<unk> ?
for you to take care of , ' said attley .
'he 's had distemper , but i 'm going abroad . '
'take him with you .
i wo n't have him .
he 's mentally afflicted . '
'look here , ' attley almost shouted , 'do i strike you as a fool ? '
<unk> , ' said i .
'well , then , if you say so , and <name> says so , that proves i ought to go abroad . '
'will 's wrong , quite wrong , ' mrs. godfrey interrupted ; 'but you must take the pup . '
'my dear boy , my dear boy , do n't you ever give anything to a woman , ' attley snorted .
bit by bit i got the story out of them in the quiet garden ( never a sign from <name> and malachi ) , while <name> stared me out of countenance , first with one <unk> eye and then with the other .
it appeared that , a month after miss sichliffe took him , the dog <name> developed distemper .
miss sichliffe had nursed him herself for some time ; then she carried him in her arms the two miles to <unk> , and wept  actually wept  at attley 's feet , saying that <name> was all she had or expected to have in this world , and attley must cure him .
attley , being by wealth , position , and temperament guardian to all lame dogs , had put everything aside for this <unk> job , and , he asserted , miss sichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since .
'she went home at night , of course , ' he exploded , 'but the rest of the time she simply infested the premises .
goodness knows , i 'm not particular , but it was a scandal .
even the servants ! ...
three and four times a day , and notes in between , to know how the beast was .
<name> it all , do n't laugh !
and wanting to send me flowers and goldfish .
do i look as if i wanted goldfish ?
ca n't you two stop for a minute ? '
( mrs. godfrey and i were clinging to each other for support . )
'and it is n't as if i was  was so alluring a personality , is it ? '
attley commands more trust , goodwill , and affection than most men , for he is that rare <name> , an absolutely unselfish bachelor , content to be run by contending <unk> of zealous friends .
his situation seemed desperate , and i told him so .
<unk> flight is your only remedy , ' was my verdict .
i 'll take care of both your cars while you 're away , and you can send me over all the greenhouse fruit . '
'but why should i be chased out of my house by a <unk> ? '
he wailed .
'oh , stop !
stop ! '
mrs. godfrey sobbed .
'you 're both wrong .
i admit you 're right , but i know you 're wrong . '
'three and four times a day , ' said attley , with an awful countenance .
'i 'm not a vain man , but  look here , <name> , i 'm not sensitive , i <name> , but if you persist in making a joke of it  ' 'oh , be quiet ! '
she almost shrieked .
'd'you imagine for one instant that your friends would ever let <unk> pass out of their hands ?
i quite agree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to <unk> at all hours of the day and night  ' 'i told you she went home o ' nights , ' attley growled .
'specially if she goes home o ' nights .
oh , but think of the life she must have led , <name> ! '
'i 'm not interfering with it ; only she must leave me alone . '
'she may want to patch you up and insure you , ' i suggested .
'd'you know what you are ? '
mrs. godfrey turned on me with the smile i have feared for the last quarter of a century .
'you 're the nice , kind , wise , <unk> friend .
you do n't know how wise and nice you are supposed to be .
<name> has sent <name> to you to complete the poor <unk> convalescence .
you know all about dogs , or <name> would n't have done it .
he 's written her that .
you 're too far off for her to make daily calls on you .
<unk> she 'll drop in two or three times a week , and write on other days .
but it does n't matter what she does , because you do n't own <unk> , do n't you see ? '
i told her i saw most clearly .
'oh , you 'll get over that in a few days , ' mrs. godfrey <unk> .
'you 're the sporting , responsible , <unk> friend who  ' 'he used to look at me like that at first , ' said attley , with a visible shudder , 'but he gave it up after a bit .
it 's only because you 're new to him . '
'but , confound you !
he 's a ghoul  ' i began .
'and when he gets quite well , you 'll send him back to her direct with your love , and she 'll give you some pretty <unk> goldfish , ' said mrs. godfrey , rising .
'that 's all settled .
car , please .
we 're going to brighton to lunch together . '
they ran before i could get into my stride , so i told the dog <name> what i thought of them and his mistress .
he never shifted his position , but stared at me , an intense , <unk> stare , eye after eye .
malachi came along when he had seen his sister off , and from a distance <unk> me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again .
but the dog <name> never even cocked his <unk> ear .
and so it continued as long as he was with me .
where i sat , he sat and stared ; where i walked , he walked beside , head stiffly <unk> over one shoulder in <unk> contemplation of me .
he never gave tongue , never closed in for a caress , seldom let me stir a step alone .
and , to my amazement , malachi , who suffered no stranger to live within our gates , saw this gaunt , growing , <unk> devil wipe him out of my service and company without a whimper .
indeed , one would have said the situation interested him , for he would meet us returning from grim walks together , and look alternately at <name> and at me with the same quivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a <unk> .
outside these <unk> , malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a woman can .
miss sichliffe came over after a few days ( luckily i was out ) with some elaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood .
she sent me a note of thanks next day .
i was reading it when <name> and malachi entered and disposed themselves as usual , <name> close up to stare at me , malachi half under the sofa , watching us both .
out of curiosity i returned <name> 's stare , then pulled his <unk> head on to my knee , and took his eye for several minutes .
now , in malachi 's eye i can see at any hour all that there is of the normal decent dog , flecked here and there with that strained <unk> which man 's love and association have added to his nature .
but with <name> the eye was perplexed , as a tortured man 's .
only by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the proper animal , <unk> and cowering beneath some unfair burden .
leggatt , my chauffeur , came in for orders .
'how d'you think <name> 's coming on ? '
i said , as i rubbed the <unk> <unk> neck .
the <unk> had warned me of the possibilities of spinal trouble following distemper .
'he ai n't my fancy , ' was the reply .
'but i do n't question his <unk> and goings so long as i 'ave n't to sit alone in a room with him . '
'why ?
he 's as meek as <name> , ' i said .
'he fair gives me the creeps .
<unk> he 'll go out in fits . '
but <name> , as i wrote his mistress from time to time , throve , and when he grew better , would play by himself grisly games of spying , walking up , hailing , and chasing another dog .
from these he would break off of a sudden and return to his normal stiff gait , with the air of one who had forgotten some matter of life and death , which could be reached only by staring at me .
i left him one evening <unk> with the unseen on the lawn , and went inside to finish some letters for the post .
i must have been at work nearly an hour , for i was going to turn on the lights , when i felt there was somebody in the room whom , the short hairs at the back of my neck warned me , i was not in the least anxious to face .
there was a mirror on the wall .
as i lifted my eyes to it i saw the dog <name> reflected near the shadow by the closed door .
he had reared himself <unk> on his hind legs , his head a little one side to clear a sofa between us , and he was looking at me .
the face , with its knitted brows and drawn lips , was the face of a dog , but the look , for the fraction of time that i caught it , was human  wholly and horribly human .
when the blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor , and was merely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion .
next day i returned him to miss sichliffe .
i would not have kept him another day for the wealth of <name> , or even <name> godfrey 's approval .
miss sichliffe 's house i discovered to be a <unk> mansion of peculiar villainy even for its period , surrounded by gardens of conflicting colours , all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on ironwork .
striped blinds , for it was a blazing autumn morning , covered most of the windows , and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten song of <name> <unk> 's  methought that the stars were blinking bright , and the old brig 's sails <unk>  down came the loud <unk> , and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a bed of <unk> consuming in their own fires  when i said i <name> sail to my love this night on the other side of the world .
i have no music , but the voice <name> .
i waited till the end : oh , maid most dear , i am not here i have no place apart  no dwelling more on sea or shore , but only in thy heart .
it seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven o'clock of a tuesday forenoon .
then miss sichliffe suddenly lumbered through a french window in clumsy haste , her brows contracted against the light .
'well ? '
she said , delivering the word like a <unk> , with the full weight of a body behind it .
'i 've brought <name> back at last , ' i replied .
'here he is . '
but it was at me she looked , not at the dog who had cast himself at her feet  looked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on the instant .
<unk>  what did you think of him ?
what did you make of him ? '
she panted .
i was too taken aback for the moment to reply .
her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees .
'o <name> , <name> !
you utterly worthless old devil ! '
she cried , and the dog <unk> and <unk> himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon .
i made to go .
'oh , but please , you must n't ! '
she tugged at the car 's side .
<unk> you like some flowers or some orchids ?
we 've really splendid orchids , and '  she clasped her hands  'there are japanese goldfish  real japanese goldfish , with four tails .
if you do n't care for 'em , perhaps your friends or somebody  oh , please ! '
<name> had recovered himself , and i realised that this woman beyond the <unk> was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her .
'certainly , ' i said , ashamed to meet her eye .
'i 'm lunching at <unk> , but  ' 'there 's plenty of time , ' she entreated .
'what do you think of <name> ? '
'he 's a queer beast , ' i said , getting out .
'he does nothing but stare at me . '
'does he stare at you all the time he 's with you ? '
<unk> .
he 's doing it now .
look ! '
we had halted .
<name> had sat down , and was staring from one to the other with a weaving motion of the head .
'he 'll do that all day , ' i said .
'what is it , <name> ? '
'yes , what is it , <name> ? '
she echoed .
the dog 's throat twitched , his body stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit .
then he came back with a visible wrench to his <unk> watch .
<unk> so ? '
she whispered .
<unk> , ' i replied , and told her something of his life with me .
she nodded once or twice , and in the end led me into the house .
there were <unk> <unk> doors of gothic design in it ; there were inlaid marble <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; there were stupendous <unk> , and octagonal , <unk> wedgwood <unk> , and <unk> austrian images holding <unk> , with every other refinement that <name> had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and 1878 .
and everything reeked of varnish .
'now ! '
she opened a <unk> door , and pointed down a long corridor flanked with more gothic doors .
'this was where we used to  to patch 'em up .
you 've heard of us .
mrs. godfrey told you in the garden the day i got <name> given me .
i '  she <name> in her breath  'i live here by myself , and i have a very large income .
come back , <name> . '
he had tiptoed down the corridor , as rigid as ever , and was sitting outside one of the shut doors .
'look here ! '
she said , and planted herself squarely in front of me .
'i tell you this because you  you've patched up <name> , too .
now , i want you to remember that my name is <name> .
mother calls me <name> because it 's more refined ; but my real name is <name> , and i am in my <unk> year . '
'very good , ' i said .
'i 'll remember all that . '
'thank you . '
then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed boy  <unk> if i have n't said the proper things .
you see  there's <name> looking at us again .
oh , i want to say  if ever you want anything in the way of orchids or goldfish or  or anything else that would be useful to you , you 've only to come to me for it .
under the <name> i'm perfectly independent , and we 're a long-lived family , worse luck ! '
she looked at me , and her face worked like glass behind driven flame .
'i may reasonably expect to live another fifty years , ' she said .
'thank you , miss sichliffe , ' i replied .
'if i want anything , you may be sure i 'll come to you for it . '
she nodded .
'now i must get over to <unk> , ' i said .
'mr .
attley <name> ask you all about this . '
for the first time she laughed aloud .
'i 'm afraid i frightened him nearly out of the county .
i didn't think , of course .
but i dare say he knows by this time he was wrong .
say good-bye to <name> . '
'good-bye , old man , ' i said .
'give me a farewell stare , so we shall know each other when we meet again . '
the dog looked up , then moved slowly toward me , and stood , head bowed to the floor , shaking in every muscle as i patted him ; and when i turned , i saw him crawl back to her feet .
that was not a good preparation for the rampant <unk> lunch at <unk> , which , as usual , i found in possession of everybody except the owner .
'but what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back ? '
attley demanded .
'the usual polite things , ' i replied .
'i 'm <unk> as the nice <unk> friend nowadays . '
'i do n't envy you .
she 's never darkened my doors , thank goodness , since i left <name> at your place .
i suppose she 'll run about the county now swearing you cured him .
that 's a woman 's idea of gratitude . '
attley seemed rather hurt , and mrs. godfrey laughed .
'that proves you were right about miss sichliffe , <name> , ' i said .
'she had no designs on anybody . '
'i 'm always right in these matters .
but did n't she even offer you a goldfish ? '
'not a thing , ' said i .
'you know what an old maid 's like where her precious dog 's concerned . '
and though i have tried vainly to lie to <name> godfrey for many years , i believe that in this case i succeeded .
when i turned into our drive that evening , leggatt observed half aloud : 'i 'm glad <unk> 's back where he belongs .
it 's time our <name> had a look in . '
sure enough , there was malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh , but still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from <name> .
* * * * * it was in <name> that attley wrote me that mrs. godfrey , <unk> in madeira with <name> , her unmarried daughter , had been attacked with something like <unk> ; that the hotel , anxious for its good name , had thrust them both out into a cottage <unk> ; that he was off with a nurse , and that i was not to leave england till i heard from him again .
in a week he wired that <name> was down as well , and that i must bring out two more nurses , with suitable delicacies .
within seventeen hours i had got them all aboard the cape boat , and had seen the women safely collapsed into <unk> .
the next few weeks were for me , as for the invalids , a low delirium , clouded with fantastic memories of portuguese officials trying to tax <unk> jelly ; <unk> doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island ; nurses who had to be exercised , taken out of themselves , and returned on the tick of change of guard ; night slides down glassy , <unk> streets , smelling of sewage and flowers , between walls whose every stone and patch attley and i knew ; <unk> in <unk> verandahs , watching the curve and descent of great stars or drawing <unk> from the break of <name> ; insane <unk> of gambling at the local <unk> , where we won heaps of <unk> silver ; blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the roads ; help offered by total strangers , grabbed at or thrust aside ; the long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a <unk> trellis , where attley sat hugging a nurse , while the others danced a noiseless , <unk> breakdown never learned at the <unk> hospital .
at last , as the tension came out all over us in aches and <unk> that we put down to the country wine , a vision of mrs. godfrey , her grey hair turned to <unk> , but her eyes triumphant over the shadow of retreating death beneath them , with <name> , enormously grown , and clutching life back to her young breast , both stretched out on cane chairs , clamouring for food .
in this <unk> hour there imported himself into our life a <unk> middle-aged man of the name of <unk> , with a blurred face and <unk> eyes .
he said he had gambled with me at the <unk> , which was no recommendation , and i remember that he twice gave me a basket of champagne and <unk> <name> for the invalids , which a sailor in a <unk> cap carried up to the cottage for me at 3 <unk> .
he turned out to be the son of some merchant <name> in the oil and colour line , and the owner of a <unk> steam yacht , into which , at his gentle <unk> , we later shifted our camp , staff , and equipage , <name> weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage .
there we lay off <unk> for weeks , while <unk> did miracles of luxury and attendance through deputies , and never once asked how his guests were enjoying themselves .
indeed , for several days at a time we would see nothing of him .
he was , he said , subject to <unk> .
giving as they do with both hands , i knew that attley and mrs. godfrey could take nobly ; but i never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as <unk> did .
'tell us why you have been so <unk> kind to us gipsies , ' mrs. godfrey said to him one day on deck .
he looked up from a diagram of some <unk> shoals which he was explaining to me , and answered with his gentle smile : 'i <name> .
it 's because it makes me happy  it makes me more than happy  to be with you .
it makes me comfortable .
you know how selfish men are ?
if a man feels comfortable all over with certain people , he 'll bore them to death , just like a dog .
you always make me feel as if pleasant things were going to happen to me . '
'have n't any ever happened before ? '
<name> asked .
'this is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many years , ' he replied .
'i feel like the man in the bible , " it 's good for me to be here . "
generally , i do n't feel that it 's good for me to be anywhere in particular . '
then , as one begging a favour .
'you 'll let me come home with you  in the same boat , i mean ?
i 'd take you back in this thing of mine , and that would save you packing your trunks , but she's too lively for spring work across the bay . '
we booked our berths , and when the time came , he wafted us and ours aboard the southampton <unk> with the pomp of <unk> and the precision of the navy .
then he dismissed his yacht , and became an inconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine , on the port side .
we ran at once into early british spring weather , followed by <unk> gales .
mrs. godfrey , <name> , and the nurses disappeared .
attley stood it out , visibly <unk> , till the next meal , and followed suit , and <unk> and i had the little table all to ourselves .
i found him even more attractive when the women were away .
the natural sweetness of the man , his voice , and bearing all fascinated me , and his knowledge of practical <unk> ( he held an extra master 's certificate ) was a real <name> .
we sat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smoking-room , making dashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour .
it was on friday night , just as i was going to bed , that he came into my cabin , after cleaning his teeth , which he did half a dozen times a day .
'i say , ' he began hurriedly , 'do you mind if i come in here for a little ?
i 'm a bit <unk> . '
i must have shown surprise .
'i 'm ever so much better about liquor than i used to be , but  it 's the whisky in the suitcase that throws me .
for god 's sake , old man , do n't go back on me to-night !
look at my hands ! '
they were fairly jumping at the wrists .
he sat down on a trunk that had slid out with the roll .
we had reduced speed , and were surging in confused seas that pounded on the black <unk> .
the night promised to be a pleasant one !
'you understand , of course , do n't you ? '
he chattered .
'oh yes , ' i said cheerily ; 'but how about  ' 'no , no ; on no account the doctor .
'tell a doctor , tell the whole ship .
besides , i 've only got a touch of 'em .
you 'd never have guessed it , would you ?
the <unk> does the trick .
i 'll give you the prescription . '
i 'll send a note to the doctor for a prescription , shall i ? '
i suggested .
<unk> !
i put myself unreservedly in your hands .
<unk> is , i always did .
i said to myself  'sure i do n't bore you ?  the minute i saw you , i said , " thou <name> the man . " '
he repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees .
'all the same , you can take it from me that the <unk> business is a rotten bad one .
i do n't care how unfaithful the shepherd may be .
drunk or sober , 't is n't cricket . '
a surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered my <name> .
i wrote my requisition to the doctor while <unk> was struggling to his feet .
'what 's wrong ? '
he began .
'oh , i know .
we 're <unk> for soundings off <unk> .
it 's about time , too .
you 'd better ship the <unk> when you come back , <unk> .
it 'll save you waking us later .
this sea 's going to get up when the tide turns .
that 'll show you , ' he said as the man left , 'that i am to be trusted .
you  you 'll stop me if i say anything i should n't , wo n't you ? '
<unk> away , ' i replied , 'if it makes you feel better . '
'that 's it ; you 've hit it exactly .
you always make me feel better .
i can rely on you .
it 's awkward soundings but you 'll see me through it .
we'll defeat him yet ... .
i may be an utterly worthless devil , but i 'm not a <unk> ... .
i told him so at breakfast .
i said , " doctor , i detest brawling , but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as <unk> insulted her , i <name> break your neck with my own hands . "
you think i was right ? '
<unk> , ' i agreed .
'then we need n't discuss the matter any further .
that man was a murderer in intention  outside the law , you understand , as it was then .
they've changed it since  but he never deceived me .
i told him so .
i said to him at the time , " i do n't know what price you 're going to put on my head , but if ever you allow <unk> to insult her again , you 'll never live to claim it . " '
'and what did he do ? '
i asked , to <name> on the conversation , for <unk> entered with the <unk> .
'oh , crumpled up at once .
<unk> still going , <unk> ? '
'i 'ave n't 'eard , ' said that faithful servant of the <unk> company .
<unk> right .
never alarm the passengers .
ship the <unk> , <name> you ? '
<unk> shipped it , for we were rolling very heavily .
there were <unk> and <unk> cries from on deck .
<unk> looked at me with a mariner 's eye .
'that 's nothing , ' he said <unk> .
'oh , it 's all right for you , ' i said , jumping at the idea .
'_i haven't an extra master 's certificate .
i 'm only a passenger .
i confess it <unk> me . '
instantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal .
'my dear fellow , it 's as simple as houses .
we 're hunting for sixty-five fathom water .
anything short of sixty , with a <unk> wind means  but i 'll get my channel pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea .
i 'm only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease . '
and so , perhaps , for another hour  he declined the drink  channel pilot in hand , he <unk> us round <unk> , and at my request <unk> to southampton , light by light , with explanations and reminiscences .
i professed myself soothed at last , and suggested bed .
'in a second , ' said he .
'now , you would n't think , would you '  he glanced off the book toward my wildly swaying dressing-gown on the door  'that i 've been seeing things for the last half-hour ?
<unk> is , i 'm just on the edge of 'em , skating on thin ice round the corner  <unk> as near as nothing  where that dog 's looking at me . '
'what 's the dog like ? '
i asked .
'ah , that is comforting of you !
most men walk through 'em to show me they are n't real .
as if i did n't know !
but you're different .
anybody could see that with half an eye . '
he stiffened and pointed .
<unk> it all !
the dog sees it too with half an  why , he knows you !
knows you perfectly .
d'you know him ? '
'how can i tell if he is n't real ? '
i insisted .
'but you can !
you're all right .
i saw that from the first .
do n't go back on me now or i shall go to pieces like the <unk> castle .
i beg your pardon , old man ; but , you see , you do know the dog .
i 'll prove it .
what 's that dog doing ?
come on !
you know . '
a tremor shook him , and he put his hand on my knee , and whispered with great meaning : <unk> letter or <unk> it with you .
there !
you begin . '
's , ' said i to humour him , for a dog would most likely be standing or sitting , or may be scratching or <unk> or staring .
<unk> , ' he went on , and i could feel the heat of his shaking hand .
<unk> , ' said i .
there was no other letter possible ; but i was shaking too .
'i . '
'n . '
<unk> , ' he ran out .
'there !
that proves it .
i knew you knew him .
you do n't know what a relief that is .
between ourselves , old man , he  he's been turning up lately a  a damn sight more often than i cared for .
and a <unk> dog  a dog that <unk> !
i mean that 's a bit too much .
eh ?
what ? '
he gulped and half rose , and i thought that the full tide of delirium would be on him in another sentence .
'not a bit of it , ' i said as a last chance , with my hand over the <unk> .
'why , you 've just proved that i know him ; so there are two of us in the game , anyhow . '
'by jove !
that is an idea !
of course there are .
i knew you 'd see me through .
we 'll defeat them yet .
hi , pup ! ...
he 's gone .
absolutely disappeared ! '
he sighed with relief , and i caught the lucky moment .
'good business !
i expect he only came to have a look at me , ' i said .
'now , get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk . '
he obeyed , protesting that he could not inconvenience me , and in the midst of apologies sank into a dead sleep .
i expected a wakeful night , having a certain amount to think over ; but no sooner had i scrambled into the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side of the world .
in the morning there were apologies , which we got over at breakfast before our party were about .
'i suppose  after this  well , i do n't blame you .
i 'm rather a lonely chap , though . '
his eyes lifted <unk> across the table .
<unk> , ' i replied , 'i 'm not running a <name> school .
you 're coming home with me in my car as soon as we land . '
'that is kind of you  kinder than you think . '
'that 's because you 're a little <unk> still .
now , i do n't want to mix up in your private affairs  ' 'but i 'd like you to , ' he interrupted .
'then , would you mind telling me the <name> name of a girl who was insulted by a man called <unk> ? '
<unk> , ' he whispered ; and just then mrs. godfrey and <name> came to table with their <unk> hats on .
we did not tie up till noon , but the faithful leggatt had <unk> his way down to the <unk> , and beside him sat malachi , wearing his collar of gold , or leggatt makes it look so , as eloquent as demosthenes .
<unk> flinched a little when he saw him .
we packed mrs. godfrey and <name> into attley 's car  they were going with him to <unk> , of course  and <name> clear across the railway lines to find england all lit and perfumed for spring .
<unk> sighed with happiness .
'd'you know , ' he said , 'if  if you 'd chucked me  i should have gone down to my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat .
and now  it 's like a dream  a good dream , you know . '
we lunched with the other three at <unk> .
then i sat in front for a little while to talk to my malachi .
when i looked back , <unk> was solidly asleep , and stayed so for the next two hours , while leggatt chased attley 's fat <unk> along the <unk> hedges .
he woke up when we said good-bye at <unk> , with promises to meet again very soon .
'and i <name> , ' said mrs. godfrey , 'that everything pleasant <name> happen to you . '
<unk> and heaps  all at once , ' cried long , weak <name> , waving her wet handkerchief .
'i 've just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire about a dog , ' i said , 'and then we <name> go home . '
'i used to know this part of the world , ' he replied , and said no more till leggatt shot past the lodge at the <unk> 's gate .
then i heard him gasp .
miss sichliffe , in a green waterproof , an orange jersey , and a pinkish leather hat , was working on a <unk> .
she straightened herself as the car stopped , and breathed hard .
<unk> got out and walked towards her .
they shook hands , turned round together , and went into the house .
then the dog <name> pranced out <unk> from under the <name> of a bench .
malachi , with one joyous swoop , fell on him as an enemy and an equal .
<name> , for his part , freed from all burden whatsoever except the obvious duty of a <unk> on his own ground , met malachi without reserve or remorse , and with six months ' additional growth to come and go on .
'do n't check 'em ! '
cried leggatt , dancing round the flurry .
<unk> both been saving up for each other all this time .
it 'll do 'em worlds of good . '
<unk> , ' i said , 'will you take mr. <unk> 's bag and suitcase up to the house and put them down just inside the door ?
then we <name> go on . '
so i enjoyed the finish alone .
it was a dead heat , and they licked each other 's jaws in amity till <name> , one imploring eye on me , leaped into the front seat , and malachi backed his appeal .
it was theft , but i took him , and we talked all the way home of <unk> and <unk> and bones and baths and the other <unk> facts of life .
that evening after dinner they slept before the fire , with their warm chins across the hollows of my ankles  to each <name> an ankle  till i kicked them upstairs to bed .
* * * * * i was not at <unk> when she came over to announce her engagement , but i heard of it when mrs. godfrey and attley came , forty miles an hour , over to me , and mrs. godfrey called me names of the worst for suppression of information .
'as long as it was n't me , i do n't care , ' said attley .
'i believe you knew it all along , ' mrs. godfrey repeated .
<unk> what made you drive that man literally into her arms ? '
'to ask after the dog <name> , ' i replied .
'then , what 's the beast doing here ? '
attley demanded , for malachi and the dog <name> were deep in a council of the family with <name> , who was being <unk> .
'oh , <name> seemed to think himself de <unk> where he was , ' i said .
'and she has n't sent after him .
you 'd better save <name> before they kill her . '
'there 's been enough lying about that dog , ' said mrs. godfrey to me .
'if he was n't born in lies , he was baptized in 'em .
d'you know why she called him <name> ?
it only occurred to me in those dreadful days when i was ill , and one ca n't keep from thinking , and thinks everything .
d'you know your <unk> ?
what did <name> say about <unk>  with an e ? '
'oh , that's it , is it ? '
i cried <unk> .
'that was why i ought to have verified my quotations .
the spelling defeated me .
wait a moment , and it <name> come back .
<name> said : " he was a vicious man , " ' i began .
' " but very kind to me , " ' mrs. godfrey prompted .
then , both together , ' " if you call a dog <unk> , i shall love him . " '
'so you were mixed up in it .
at any rate , you had your suspicions from the first ?
tell me , ' she said .
<unk> , ' i said , 'i do n't know anything rational or reasonable about any of it .
it was all  all <unk> , and it scared me horribly . '
'why ? '
she asked .
that was six years ago .
i have written this tale to let her know  wherever she may be .
the <unk> until thy feet have trod the road advise not wayside folk , nor till thy back has borne the load break in upon the broke .
<name> not with <unk> largesse of sympathy the heart which , knowing her own bitterness , <unk> to dwell apart .
employ not that glad hand to raise the <unk> head to heaven , and all the neighbours ' gaze  cover thy mouth instead .
the quivering <name> , the bitten lip , the cold and sweating brow , later may yearn for fellowship  not now , you ass , not now !
time , not thy ne'er so timely speech , life , not thy views thereon , shall furnish or deny to each his consolation .
or , if impelled to interfere , <unk> , uplift , advise , lend not a base , betraying ear to all the victim 's cries .
only the lord can understand when those first pangs begin , how much is reflex action and how much is really sin .
e'en from good words thyself refrain , and tremblingly admit there is no <unk> for pain except the shock of it .
so , when thine own dark hour shall fall , unchallenged canst thou say : 'i never worried you at all , for god 's sake go away ! '
the village that voted the earth was flat ( 1913 ) our drive till then had been quite a success .
the other men in the car were my friend woodhouse , young ollyett , a distant connection of his , and pallant , the m.p .
woodhouse 's business was the treatment and cure of sick journals .
he knew by instinct the precise moment in a <unk> life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it fetches up on the <unk> between slow and expensive collapse and the new start which can be given by gold <unk>  and genius .
he was wisely ignorant of journalism ; but when he stooped on a <unk> there was sure to be meat .
he had that week added a <unk> , <unk> evening paper to his collection , which consisted of a prosperous london daily , one provincial ditto , and a <unk> weekly of commercial <unk> .
he had also , that very hour , planted me with a large block of the evening paper 's common shares , and was explaining the whole <name> of <unk> to ollyett , a young man three years from oxford , with <unk> hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh experiences , who , i understood , was assisting in the new venture .
pallant , the long , wrinkled m.p. , whose voice is more like a <unk> than a peacock 's , took no shares , but gave us all advice .
'you 'll find it rather a <unk> 's yard , ' woodhouse was saying .
'yes , i know they call me the <unk> ; but it <name> pay inside a year .
all my papers do .
i 've only one motto : back your luck and back your staff .
it 'll come out all right . '
then the car stopped , and a policeman asked our names and addresses for exceeding the <unk> .
we pointed out that the road ran absolutely straight for half a mile ahead without even a <unk> .
'that 's just what we depend on , ' said the policeman unpleasantly .
'the usual swindle , ' said woodhouse under his breath .
'what 's the name of this place ? '
<unk> , ' said the policeman .
<unk> , ' and wrote something in his note-book at which young ollyett protested .
a large red man on a grey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge shouted an order we could not catch .
the policeman laid his hand on the rim of the right <unk> ( woodhouse carries his spare <unk> aft ) , and it closed on the button of the electric horn .
the grey horse at once bolted , and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape .
<unk> it , man , you 've got your silly fist on it !
take it off ! '
woodhouse shouted .
'ho ! '
said the constable , looking carefully at his fingers as though we had trapped them .
'that wo n't do you any good either , ' and he wrote once more in his note-book before he allowed us to go .
this was woodhouse 's first brush with motor law , and since i expected no ill consequences to myself , i pointed out that it was very serious .
i took the same view myself when in due time i found that i , too , was <unk> on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to <unk> traffic .
judgment was done in a little <unk> <unk> with a small , jubilee <unk> and a large <unk> .
woodhouse drove us there in his car .
pallant , who had not been included in the summons , came with us as moral support .
while we waited outside , the fat man on the grey horse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates .
he said to one of them  for i took the trouble to note it down  'it falls away from my <unk> , dead straight , three-quarters of a mile .
i 'd defy any one to resist it .
we <unk> seventy pounds out of 'em last month .
no car can resist the temptation .
you ought to have one your side the county , <name> .
they simply ca n't resist it . '
<unk> ! '
said woodhouse .
'we 're in for trouble .
do n't you say a word  or ollyett either !
i 'll pay the fines and we 'll get it over as soon as possible .
where 's pallant ? '
'at the back of the court somewhere , ' said ollyett .
'i saw him slip in just now . '
the fat man then took his seat on the bench , of which he was chairman , and i gathered from a <unk> that his name was sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , of <unk> park , huckley .
he began with an <unk> pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires .
evidence , when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause , was given in the pauses of the address .
they were all very proud of their sir <name> , and looked from him to us , wondering why we did not applaud too .
taking its time from the chairman , the bench <unk> with us for seventeen minutes .
sir <name> explained that he was sick and tired of processions of <unk> of our type , who would be better employed breaking stones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves or their ancestors .
this was after it had been proved that <unk> man had turned on the horn purposely to annoy sir <name> , who happened to be riding by ' !
there were other remarks too  primitive enough ,  but it was the unspeakable brutality of the tone , even more than the quality of the justice , or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out of all reason .
when we were dismissed  to the tune of twenty-three pounds , twelve shillings and sixpence  we waited for pallant to join us , while we listened to the next case  one of driving without a <unk> .
ollyett with an eye to his evening paper , had already taken very full notes of our own , but we did not wish to seem prejudiced .
'it 's all right , ' said the reporter of the local paper soothingly .
'we never report sir <name> in <unk> .
only the fines and charges . '
'oh , thank you , ' ollyett replied , and i heard him ask who every one in court might be .
the local reporter was very communicative .
the new victim , a large , <unk> man in somewhat striking clothes , to which sir <name> , now thoroughly warmed , <name> public attention , said that he had left his <unk> at home .
sir <name> asked him if he expected the police to go to his home address at jerusalem to find it for him ; and the court roared .
nor did sir <name> approve of the man 's name , but insisted on calling him 'mr .
<unk> , ' and every time he did so , all his people shouted .
evidently this was their established <unk> .
'he did n't summons me  because i 'm in the house , i suppose .
i think i shall have to ask a question , ' said pallant , <unk> at the close of the case .
'i think i shall have to give it a little publicity too , ' said woodhouse .
'we ca n't have this kind of thing going on , you know . '
his face was set and quite white .
pallant 's , on the other hand , was black , and i know that my very stomach had turned with rage .
ollyett was dum .
'well , let 's have lunch , ' woodhouse said at last .
'then we can get away before the show breaks up . '
we <name> ollyett from the arms of the local reporter , crossed the market square to the red lion and found sir <name> 's 'mr .
<unk> ' just sitting down to beer , beef and pickles .
'ah ! '
said he , in a large voice .
<unk> in misfortune .
wo n't you gentlemen join me ? '
<unk> , ' said woodhouse .
'what did you get ? '
'i have n't decided .
it might make a good turn , but  the public aren't educated up to it yet .
it 's beyond 'em .
if it was n't , that red dub on the bench would be worth fifty a week . '
'where ? '
said woodhouse .
the man looked at him with unaffected surprise .
'at any one of my places , ' he replied .
'but perhaps you live here ? '
'good heavens ! '
cried young ollyett suddenly .
'you are masquerier , then ?
i thought you were ! '
<unk> masquerier . '
he let the words fall with the weight of an international ultimatum .
'yes , that 's all i am .
but you have the advantage of me , gentlemen . '
for the moment , while we were introducing ourselves , i was puzzled .
then i recalled <unk> <unk> <unk>  of enormous <unk>  that had been the unnoticed background of my visits to london for years past .
<unk> of men and women , singers , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of every draped and <unk> brand , all moved on and off in london and the provinces by bat masquerier  with the long <unk> flourish following the final <unk> . '
'_i knew you at once , ' said pallant , the trained m.p. , and i promptly backed the lie .
woodhouse mumbled excuses .
bat masquerier was not moved for or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces .
'i always tell my people there 's a limit to the size of the <unk> , ' he said .
<unk> that and the <unk> does n't take it in .
<unk> ' is the most delicate of all the sciences . '
'there 's one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if i live for the next twenty-four hours , ' said woodhouse , and explained how this would come about .
masquerier stared at him <unk> with <unk> eyes .
'you mean it ? '
he drawled ; the voice was as magnetic as the look .
'_i do , ' said ollyett .
'that business of the horn alone ought to have him off the bench in three months . '
masquerier looked at him even longer than he had looked at woodhouse .
'he told me , ' he said suddenly , 'that my <unk> was jerusalem .
you heard that ? '
'but it was the tone  the tone , ' ollyett cried .
'you noticed that , too , did you ? '
said masquerier .
'that 's the artistic temperament .
you can do a lot with it .
and i 'm bat masquerier , ' he went on .
he dropped his <name> in his fists and scowled straight in front of him ... . 'i made the <unk>  i made the <unk> and the <unk> .
i made 'dal <unk> . '
here ollyett sat straight up , for in common with the youth of that year he worshipped miss <unk> <unk> of the <unk> immensely and unreservedly .
' " is that a dressing-gown or an ulster you 're supposed to be wearing ? "
you heard that ? ...
" and i suppose you had n't time to brush your hair either ? "
you heard that ? ...
now , you hear me ! '
his voice filled the <unk> , then dropped to a whisper as dreadful as a surgeon 's before an operation .
he spoke for several minutes .
pallant muttered 'hear !
hear ! '
i saw ollyett 's eye flash  it was to ollyett that masquerier addressed himself chiefly ,  and woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands .
'are you with me ? '
he went on , gathering us all up in one sweep of the arm .
'when i begin a thing i see it through , gentlemen .
what bat can't break , breaks him !
but i have n't struck that thing yet .
this is no <unk> <unk> show .
this is business to the dead finish .
are you with me , gentlemen ?
good !
now , we 'll pool our assets .
one london morning , and one provincial daily , did n't you say ?
one weekly commercial ditto and one m.p . '
'not much use , i 'm afraid , ' pallant <unk> .
'but privileged .
but privileged , ' he returned .
'and we have also my little team  london , <unk> , liverpool , leeds  i 'll tell you about manchester later  and me !
bat masquerier . '
he breathed the name reverently into his <unk> .
'gentlemen , when our combination has finished with sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , and everything else that is his , sodom and gomorrah <name> be a <unk> bit of <name> england beside 'em .
i must go back to town now , but i trust you gentlemen <name> give me the pleasure of your company at dinner to-night at the chop <unk>  the red <name> room  and we 'll block out the <unk> . '
he laid his hand on young ollyett 's shoulder and added : 'it 's your brains i want . '
then he left , in a good deal of <unk> collar and nickel-plated <unk> , and the place felt less crowded .
we ordered our car a few minutes later .
as woodhouse , ollyett and i were getting in , sir <name> <unk> , <unk> , m.p. , came out of the hall of justice across the square and mounted his horse .
i have sometimes thought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been saved , but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and must needs shout : 'not off yet ?
you 'd better get away and you 'd better be careful . '
at that moment pallant , who had been buying <unk> , came out of the inn , took sir <name> 's eye and very leisurely entered the car .
it seemed to me that for one instant there was a shade of uneasiness on the <unk> 's <unk> face .
'i <name> , ' said woodhouse after several miles , 'i <name> he 's a widower . '
'yes , ' said pallant .
'for his poor , dear wife 's sake i <name> that , very much indeed .
i suppose he did n't see me in court .
oh , here 's the parish history of huckley written by the rector and here 's your share of the <unk> .
are we all dining with this mr. masquerier to-night ? '
'yes ! '
said we all .
* * * * * if woodhouse knew nothing of journalism , young ollyett , who had graduated in a hard school , knew a good deal .
our <unk> evening paper , which we <name> call the bun to distinguish her from her prosperous morning sister , the cake , was not only diseased but corrupt .
we found this out when a man brought us the <unk> of a new <unk> and demanded <unk> on its prosperity .
ollyett talked pure <unk> to him for three minutes .
otherwise he spoke and wrote <unk>  a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
but though the slang changes the game never alters , and ollyett and i and , in the end , some others enjoyed it immensely .
it was weeks ere we could see the wood for the trees , but so soon as the staff realised that they had proprietors who backed them right or wrong , and specially when they were wrong ( which is the sole secret of journalism ) , and that their fate did not <name> on any passing owner 's passing mood , they did miracles .
but we did not neglect huckley .
as ollyett said our first care was to create an <unk> atmosphere ' round it .
he used to visit the village of <unk> , on a <unk> with a <unk> ; for which reason i left the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract .
yet it was i who <name> first blood .
two inhabitants of huckley wrote to contradict a small , quite solid paragraph in the bun that a <unk> had been seen at huckley and had , 'of course , been shot by the local sportsmen . '
there was some heat in their letters , both of which we published .
our version of how the <unk> got his crest from king <name> was , i grieve to say , so inaccurate that the rector himself  no sportsman as he pointed out , but a lover of accuracy  wrote to us to correct it .
we gave his letter good space and thanked him .
'this priest is going to be useful , ' said ollyett .
'he has the impartial mind .
i shall <unk> him . '
forthwith he created <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of refined tastes who in the bun demanded to know whether this <unk> was the <unk> of his boyhood and whether , by any chance , the fell change of name had been wrought by collusion between a local <unk> and the railway , in the mistaken interests of <unk> refinement .
'for i knew it and loved it with the maidens of my day  <unk> ab <unk> !   as <unk> , ' wrote <unk> .
<unk> from <unk> .
though other papers scoffed , the bun was gravely sympathetic .
several people wrote to deny that huckley had been changed at birth .
only the rector  no philosopher as he pointed out , but a lover of accuracy  had his doubts , which he laid publicly before mr. <unk> .
<unk> who suggested , through the bun , that the little place might have begun life in anglo-saxon days as <unk> ' or among the normans as <unk> , ' on account of its much <name> .
the rector had his own ideas too ( he said it was mostly gravel ) , and <unk> .
<unk> had a fund of reminiscences .
oddly enough  which is seldom the case with free <unk>  our subscribers rather <unk> the correspondence , and contemporaries quoted freely .
'the secret of power , ' said ollyett , 'is not the big stick .
it 's the <unk> stick . '
( this means the <unk> ' quotation of six or seven lines . )
'did you see the <unk> had a middle on " rural <unk> " last week .
that was all huckley .
i 'm doing a " <unk> " on huckley next week . '
our <unk> ' were friday evening accounts of easy <unk> trips round london , illustrated ( we could never get that machine to work properly ) by <unk> maps .
ollyett wrote the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which i always ascribed to the <unk> .
his account of <unk> forest , for instance , was simply young love with its soul at its lips .
but his huckley <unk> ' would have sickened a <unk> .
it chemically combined loathsome familiarity , <unk> suggestion , slimy piety and <unk> <unk> service ' in one fuming <unk> that fairly lifted me off my feet .
'yes , ' said he , after compliments .
'it 's the most vital , arresting and dynamic bit of <unk> i 've done up to date .
non <unk> <name> !  i met sir <name> <unk> in his own park .
he talked to me again .
he inspired most of it . '
'which ?
the " <unk> native drawl , " or " the neglected <unk> of the village children " ? '
i demanded .
'oh , no !
that 's only to bring in the panel doctor .
it 's the last flight we  i 'm proudest of . '
this dealt with 'the <unk> <unk> spreading her dim limbs over the <unk> ' ; with <unk> rabbits ' ; with a herd of <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ; and with the <unk> , <unk> face of their <unk> , scholarly owner  as well known at the <name> agricultural shows as that of our late <unk> . '
' " <unk> " is good and so 's " <unk> , " ' said i , 'but the panel doctor <name> be annoyed about the <unk> . '
'not half as much as sir <name> <name> about his face , ' said ollyett .
'and if you only knew what i 've left out ! '
he was right .
the panel doctor spent his week-end ( this is the advantage of friday articles ) in overwhelming us with a professional <unk> of no interest whatever to our subscribers .
we told him so , and he , then and there , battered his way with it into the <unk> where they are keen on glands , and forgot us altogether .
but sir <name> <unk> was of sterner stuff .
he must have spent a happy week-end too .
the letter which we received from him on monday proved him to be a <unk> <unk> of upright life , for no woman , however remotely interested in a man would have let it pass the home <unk> .
he objected to our references to his own herd , to his own labours in his own village , which he said was a model village , and to our infernal insolence ; but he objected most to our <unk> of his features .
we wrote him <unk> to ask whether the letter was meant for publication .
he , remembering , i presume , the duke of wellington , wrote back , <unk> and be damned . '
'oh !
this is too easy , ' ollyett said as he began heading the letter .
'stop a minute , ' i said .
'the game is getting a little beyond us .
to-night 's the bat dinner . '
( i may have forgotten to tell you that our dinner with bat masquerier in the red <name> room of the chop <unk> had come to be a weekly affair . )
'hold it over till they 've all seen it . '
'perhaps you 're right , ' he said .
'you might waste it . '
at dinner , then , sir <name> 's letter was handed round .
bat seemed to be thinking of other matters , but pallant was very interested .
'i 've got an idea , ' he said presently .
'could you put something into the bun to-morrow about <unk> disease in that fellow 's herd ? '
'oh , plague if you like , ' ollyett replied .
'they 're only five measly shorthorns .
i saw one lying down in the park .
she 'll serve as a <unk> of fact . '
'then , do that ; and hold the letter over meanwhile .
i think i come in here , ' said pallant .
'why ? '
said i .
'because there 's something coming up in the house about <unk> , and because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined you .
<unk> ten days to think it over .
here you are , ' said pallant .
<unk> of commons paper , you see . '
we read : dear pallant  although in the past our paths have not lain much together , i am sure you <name> agree with me that on the floor of the house all members are on a footing of equality .
i make bold , therefore , to approach you in a matter which i think capable of a very different interpretation from that which perhaps was put upon it by your friends .
<name> you let them know that that was the case and that i was in no way swayed by animus in the exercise of my <unk> duties , which as you , as a brother magistrate , can imagine are frequently very distasteful to  yours very sincerely , t. <unk> .
<unk>  i have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in my district .
'what did you answer ? '
said ollyett , when all our opinions had been expressed .
'i told him i could n't do anything in the matter .
and i could n't  then .
but you 'll remember to put in that <unk> paragraph .
i want something to work upon . '
'it seems to me the bun has done all the work up to date , ' i suggested .
'when does the cake come in ? '
<unk> cake , ' said woodhouse , and i remembered afterwards that he spoke like a cabinet minister on the <name> of a budget , <unk> to itself the fullest right to deal with situations as they arise . '
<unk> ! '
bat masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts .
' " situations as they arise . "
i ai n't idle either .
but there 's no use fishing till the swim 's baited .
you '  he turned to ollyett  <unk> very good <unk> ... .
i always tell my people  what the deuce is that ? '
there was a burst of song from another private dining-room across the landing .
'it <unk> some ladies from the <unk> , ' the waiter began .
'oh , i know that .
what are they singing , though ? '
he rose and went out , to be greeted by shouts of applause from that <name> company .
then there was silence , such as one hears in the form-room after a master 's entry .
then a voice that we loved began again : 'here we go gathering nuts in may  nuts in may  nuts in may ! '
'it 's only 'dal  and some nuts , ' he explained when he returned .
'she says she 's coming in to dessert . '
he sat down , humming the old tune to himself , and till miss <unk> <unk> entered , he held us speechless with tales of the artistic temperament .
we obeyed pallant to the extent of slipping into the bun a wary paragraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth , which might be read either as an unkind libel or , in the hands of a capable lawyer , as a piece of faithful <unk> .
'and besides , ' said ollyett , 'we allude to " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
i am advised that no action can lie in respect of virgin shorthorns .
pallant wants us to come to the house to-night .
he 's got us places for the strangers ' gallery .
i 'm beginning to like pallant . '
<unk> seems to like you , ' i said .
'yes , but i 'm afraid of him , ' ollyett answered with perfect sincerity .
'i am .
he 's the absolutely <unk> soul .
i 've never met one yet . '
we went to the house together .
it happened to be an <name> afternoon , and as soon as i had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out , i gathered there were grievances in the air , but how many of them was beyond me .
'it 's all right , ' said ollyett of the trained ear .
'they 've shut their ports against  oh yes  export of <name> cattle !
<unk> disease at <unk> .
i see pallant 's idea ! '
the house was certainly all mouth for the moment , but , as i could feel , quite in <name> .
a minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to be <unk> off volleys of insults .
he reminded me somehow of a nervous huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds .
'it 's <unk> .
they 're asking questions , ' said ollyett .
'look !
pallant 's up . '
there was no mistaking it .
his voice , which his enemies said was his one parliamentary <unk> , silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere singing in the ears .
he said : <unk> out of that , may i ask if any special consideration has recently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease on this side of the channel ? '
he raised his hand ; it held a noon edition of the bun .
we had thought it best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones .
he would have continued , but something in a grey frock-coat roared and bounded on a bench opposite , and waved another bun .
it was sir <name> <unk> .
'as the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated  ' his voice was drowned in shouts of <unk> ! '
 the <name> leading .
'what 's wrong ? '
i asked ollyett .
'he 's got his hat on his head , hasn't he ? '
'yes , but his wrath should have been put as a question . '
<unk> out of that , mr. speaker , <unk> ! '
sir <name> bellowed through a lull , 'are you aware that  that all this is a conspiracy  part of a dastardly conspiracy to make huckley ridiculous  to make us ridiculous ?
part of a <unk> plot to make me ridiculous , mr. speaker , sir ! '
the man 's face showed almost black against his white whiskers , and he struck out <unk> with his arms .
his vehemence puzzled and held the house for an instant , and the speaker took advantage of it to lift his pack from ireland to a new scent .
he addressed sir <name> <unk> in tones of measured rebuke , meant also , i imagine , for the whole house , which lowered its hackles at the word .
then pallant , shocked and pained : 'i can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple question the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a personal attack .
if i have in any way offended  ' again the speaker intervened , for it appeared that he regulated these matters .
he , too , expressed surprise , and sir <name> sat back in a hush of <unk> that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it .
the empire 's work was resumed .
<unk> ! '
said i , and i felt hot and cold up my back .
'and now we 'll publish his letter , ' said ollyett .
we did  on the heels of his carefully reported outburst .
we made no comment .
with that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation which is the <name> of the anglo-saxon , all our contemporaries and , i should say , two-thirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person could be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be .
but beyond spelling his name <unk> , ' we alone refused to hit a man when he was down .
'there 's no need , ' said ollyett .
'the whole press is on the buckle from end to end . '
even woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had come about , and said as much .
<unk> ! '
said ollyett .
'we have n't really begun .
huckley is n't news yet . '
'what do you mean ? '
said woodhouse , who had grown to have great respect for his young but by no means distant connection .
<unk> ?
by the <name> of god , master ridley , i mean to have it so that when huckley turns over in its sleep , <unk> and the press association jump out of bed to cable . '
then he went off at score about certain <unk> in huckley church which , he said  and he seemed to spend his every week-end there  had been perpetrated by the <unk> predecessor , who had abolished a <unk> ' or a <unk> ( whatever these may be ) to institute a lavatory in the vestry .
it did not strike me as stuff for which <unk> or the press association would lose much sleep , and i left him <unk> to woodhouse about a <unk> font which , he said , he had unearthed in the <unk> <unk> .
my methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration .
an odd copy , in the <unk> <unk> library , of <unk> 's every-day book had revealed to me the existence of a village dance founded , like all village dances , on <unk> mysteries connected with the solar <unk> ( which is always <unk> ) and <unk> morning , which is dewy and refreshing to the london eye .
for this i take no credit  <unk> being a mine any one can work  but that i <unk> that dance , after i had revised it , 'the <unk> ' is my title to immortal fame .
it was still to be witnessed , i wrote , 'in all its poignant purity at huckley , that last home of significant <unk> <unk> ' ; and i fell so in love with my creation that i kept it back for days , <unk> and <unk> .
'you 's better put it in , ' said ollyett at last .
'it 's time we asserted ourselves again .
the other fellows are beginning to <unk> .
you saw that thing in the pinnacle about sir <name> 's model village ?
he must have got one of their chaps down to do it . '
<unk> like the wounds of a friend , ' i said .
'that account of the <unk> pub alone was  ' 'i liked the bit best about the <unk> <unk> and the fallen virgins who wash sir <name> 's dress shirts .
our side could n't come within a mile of that , you know .
we have n't the proper <unk> for sexual <unk> . '
'that 's what i 'm always saying , ' i retorted .
<unk> 'em alone .
the other fellows are doing our work for us now .
besides i want to touch up my " <unk> dance " a little more . '
'no .
you 'll spoil it .
let 's shove it in to-day .
for one thing it's literature .
i do n't go in for compliments as you know , but , etc .
etc . '
i had a healthy suspicion of young ollyett in every aspect , but though i knew that i should have to pay for it , i fell to his flattery , and my priceless article on the <unk> dance ' appeared .
next saturday he asked me to bring out the bun in his absence , which i naturally assumed would be connected with the little <unk> <unk> .
i was wrong .
on the following monday i glanced at the cake at <unk> to make sure , as usual , of her inferiority to my beloved but <unk> bun .
i opened on a heading : 'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
i read ...
i read that the <unk> society  a society devoted to the proposition that the earth is flat  had held its annual banquet and exercises at huckley on saturday , when after convincing addresses , amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm , huckley village had decided by an unanimous vote of 438 that the earth was flat .
i do not remember that i breathed again till i had finished the two columns of description that followed .
only one man could have written them .
they were flawless  crisp , nervous , austere yet human , poignant , vital , arresting  most distinctly arresting  dynamic enough to shift a city  and <unk> by whole sticks at a time .
and there was a leader , a grave and poised leader , which tore me in two with mirth , until i remembered that i had been left out  <unk> and <unk> dropped .
i went to ollyett 's rooms .
he was <unk> , and , to do him justice , looked <unk> .
'it was n't my fault , ' he began .
'it was bat masquerier .
i swear i would have asked you to come if  ' 'never mind that , ' i said .
'it 's the best bit of work you 've ever done or <name> do .
did any of it happen ? '
<unk> ?
heavens !
d'you think even i could have invented it ? '
'is it exclusive to the cake ? '
i cried .
'it cost bat masquerier two thousand , ' ollyett replied .
'd'you think he 'd let any one else in on that ?
but i give you my sacred word i knew nothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it .
he had huckley posted in three colours , " the <unk> ' annual banquet and exercises . "
yes , he invented " <unk> . "
he wanted huckley to think it meant <unk> .
yes , i know that there is a real society that thinks the world 's flat  they ought to be grateful for the lift  but bat made his own .
he did !
he created the whole show , i tell you .
he swept out half his halls for the job .
think of that  on a saturday !
they  we went down in motor <unk>  three of 'em  one pink , one primrose , and one <unk> blue  twenty people in each one and " the earth is flat " on each side and across the back .
i went with <name> <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> , and both the <unk> sisters , and  wait a minute !  the <unk> trio .
you know the every-day dramas trio at the <unk>  <name> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> , and little <unk> ?
them .
and there was <unk> <unk> , the <unk> chap in <unk> and <unk>  and there was <name> <unk> .
yes , you know him !
the north london <name> .
" i 'm the <unk> that got himself disliked at blackheath . "
that chap !
and there was <unk>  that one-eyed scotch fellow that all glasgow is crazy about .
talk of <unk> yourself for <name> 's sake !
<unk> was the <name> inquirer who got converted at the end of the meeting .
and there was quite a lot of girls i did n't know , and  oh , yes  there was 'dal !
'dal <unk> herself !
we sat together , going and coming .
she 's all the darling there ever was .
she sent you her love , and she told me to tell you that she wo n't forget about <name> <unk> .
she says you 've given her an ideal to work for .
she ?
oh , she was the <name> secretary to the <unk> , of course .
i forget who were in the other brakes  provincial stars mostly  but they played up gorgeously .
the <name> of the <unk> 's changed since your day .
they did n't <unk> it a bit .
you see , people who believe the earth is flat do n't dress quite like other people .
you may have noticed that i hinted at that in my account .
it 's a rather <unk> <unk> style  <unk> , except for the <unk> , 'dal told me ,  but 'dal looked heavenly in it !
so did little <unk> .
and there was a girl in the blue brake  she 's a provincial  but she 's coming to town this <name> and she 'll knock 'em  <name> <unk> .
remember that !
she told huckley how she had suffered for the cause as a governess in a <name> family where they believed that the world is round , and how she threw up her job sooner than teach immoral geography .
that was at the overflow meeting outside the baptist chapel .
she knocked 'em to sawdust !
we must look out for <name> ... .
but <unk> !
<unk> was beyond everything .
impact , personality  conviction  the whole bag o ' tricks !
he sweated conviction .
gad , he convinced me while he was speaking !
( him ?
he was president of the <unk> , of course .
have n't you read my account ? )
it is an <unk> plausible theory .
after all , no one has actually proved the earth is round , have they ? '
'never mind the earth .
what about huckley ? '
'oh , huckley got tight .
that 's the worst of these model villages if you let 'em smell <unk> .
there 's one <unk> pub in the place that sir <name> ca n't get rid of .
bat made it his base .
he sent down the banquet in two motor <unk>  dinner for five hundred and drinks for ten thousand .
huckley voted all right .
do n't you make any mistake about that .
no vote , no dinner .
a unanimous vote  exactly as i 've said .
at least , the rector and the doctor were the only <unk> .
we didn't count them .
oh yes , sir <name> was there .
he came and grinned at us through his park gates .
he 'll grin worse to-day .
there 's an <unk> dye that you rub through a <unk> that eats about a foot into any stone and wears good to the last .
bat had both the <unk> <unk> " the earth is flat ! "
and all the barns and walls they could get at ... . oh lord , but huckley was drunk !
we had to fill 'em up to make 'em forgive us for not being <unk> .
<unk> <unk> !
d'you realise that emperors could n't have commanded the talent bat <unk> on 'em ?
why , 'dal alone was ... . and by eight o'clock not even a bit of paper left !
the whole show packed up and gone , and huckley <unk> for the earth being flat . '
'very good , ' i began .
'i am , as you know , a one-third proprietor of the bun . '
'i did n't forget that , ' ollyett interrupted .
'that was uppermost in my mind all the time .
i 've got a special account for the bun to-day  it's an <unk>  and just to show how i thought of you , i told 'dal , coming home , about your <unk> dance , and she told <name> .
<name> came back in our <unk> .
after a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field .
it 's quite a dance the way we did it  and <unk> invented a sort of gorilla <unk> procession at the end .
bat had sent down a <unk> on the chance of getting something .
he was the son of a clergyman  a most dynamic personality .
he said there is n't anything for the <unk> in meetings <unk> meetings  they lack action .
films are a branch of <name> by themselves .
but he went wild over the <unk> .
he said it was like peter's vision at <unk> .
he took about a million feet of it .
then i <unk> it exclusive for the bun .
i 've sent 'em in already , only remember we must eliminate <name> 's left leg in the first figure .
it 's too arresting ... . and there you are !
but i tell you i 'm afraid of bat .
that man 's the personal devil .
he did it all .
he did n't even come down himself .
he said he 'd distract his people . '
'why did n't he ask me to come ? '
i persisted .
'because he said you 'd distract me .
he said he wanted my brains on ice .
he got 'em .
i believe it 's the best thing i 've ever done . '
he reached for the cake and <unk> it luxuriously .
'yes , out and away the best  supremely <unk> , ' he concluded , and  after another survey  'by god , what a genius i was yesterday ! '
i would have been angry , but i had not the time .
that morning , press agencies <unk> to me in the bun office for leave to use certain photos , which , they understood , i controlled , of a certain village dance .
when i had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears , my self-respect came back a little .
then there was the <unk> poster to get out .
<name> being elimination , i fined it down to two words ( one too many , as it proved )  'the <unk> ! '
in red , at which our manager protested ; but by five o'clock he told me that i was the <name> of fleet street .
ollyett 's account in the bun of the <unk> exercises and love feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in the cake , but it bruised more ; while the photos of 'the <unk> ' ( which , with <name> 's left leg , was why i had set the doubtful press to work so early ) were beyond praise and , next day , beyond price .
but even then i did not understand .
a week later , i think it was , bat masquerier telephoned to me to come to the <unk> .
'it 's your turn now , ' he said .
'i 'm not asking ollyett .
come to the <unk> . '
i went , and , as bat 's guest , was received as royalty is not .
we sat well back and looked out on the packed thousands .
it was <unk> and <unk> , that fluid and electric review which bat  though he gave <unk> the credit  really created .
<unk> , ' said bat dreamily , after <unk> had given 'the nasty jar ' to the forty thieves in their forty oil <unk> . '
'as you say , i've got 'em and i can hold 'em .
what a man does does n't matter much ; and how he does it do n't matter either .
it 's the when  the psychological moment .
<unk> ca n't make up for it ; money ca n't ; brains ca n't .
a <unk> luck , but all the rest is genius .
i 'm not speaking about my people now .
i 'm talking of myself . '
then 'dal  she was the only one who dared  knocked at the door and stood behind us all alive and panting as <unk> .
<unk> was carrying the <unk> scene , and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter .
'ah !
tell a fellow now , ' she asked me for the twentieth time , 'did you love <name> <unk> when you were young ? '
'did we love her ? '
i answered .
' " if the earth and the sky and the sea "  there were three million of us , 'dal , and we worshipped her . '
'how did she get it across ? '
<unk> went on .
'she was <name> .
the houses used to <unk> over her when she came on . '
'i 've had a good deal , but i 've never been cooed over yet , ' said 'dal wistfully .
'it is n't the how , it 's the when , ' bat repeated .
'ah ! '
he leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal <unk> .
'dal fled .
a sinuous and silent procession was filing into the <unk> to a scarcely audible accompaniment .
it was dressed  but the world and all its <unk> know how it was dressed .
it danced and it danced , and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in the leg for half a year , and it wound up with the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the house down in <unk> , sobbing and aching .
somebody in the gallery moaned , 'oh <unk> , the <unk> ! '
and we heard the word run like a shudder , for they had not a full breath left among them .
then 'dal came on , an electric <name> in her dark hair , the diamonds flashing in her <unk> heels  a vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds while the <unk> scene dissolved behind her into <unk> <unk> palace , and they recovered themselves .
the <name> on her forehead went out , and a soft light bathed her as she took  slowly , slowly to the <unk> of adoring strings  the eighteen paces forward .
we saw her first as a <name> alone ; next as a <name> for the first time conscious of her subjects , and at the end , when her hands fluttered , as a woman delighted , awed not a little , but transfigured and illuminated with sheer , compelling affection and goodwill .
i caught the broken mutter of welcome  the <unk> which is more than <unk> of applause .
it died and rose and died again lovingly .
'she 's got it across , ' bat whispered .
'i 've never seen her like this .
i told her to light up the <name> , but i was wrong , and she knew it .
she's an artist . '
<unk> , you darling ! '
some one spoke , not loudly but it carried through the house .
'thank you ! '
'dal answered , and in that broken tone one heard the last fetter riveted .
'good evening , boys !
i 've just come from  now  where the <unk> was it i have come from ? '
she turned to the impassive files of the <unk> dancers , and went on : 'ah , so good of you to remind me , you dear , <unk> things .
i 've just come from the village  the village that voted the earth was flat . '
she swept into that song with the full orchestra .
it <unk> the habitable earth for the next six months .
imagine , then , what its rage and pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth !
she only gave the chorus once .
at the end of the second verse , 'are you with me , boys ? '
she cried , and the house tore it clean away from her  <unk> was flat  earth was flat .
flat as my hat  flatter than that '  drowning all but the <unk> and <unk> that marked the word .
<unk> , ' i said to bat .
'and it 's only " nuts in may , " with variations . '
'yes  but i did the variations , ' he replied .
at the last verse she <unk> to <unk> the conductor , who threw her up his baton .
she caught it with a boy 's ease .
'are you with me ? '
she cried once more , and  the maddened house behind her  abolished all the instruments except the guttural <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> '  'the village that voted the earth was flat  earth was flat ! '
it was delirium .
then she picked up the <unk> dancers and led them in a clattering improvised <unk> thrice round the stage till her last kick sent her <unk> shoe <unk> to the <unk> .
i saw the forest of hands raised to catch it , heard the roaring and stamping pass through <unk> to full typhoon ; heard the song , pinned down by the faithful <unk> as the bull-dog pins down the bellowing bull , <unk> even those ; till at last the curtain fell and bat took me round to her dressing-room , where she lay spent after her seventh call .
still the song , through all those <unk> walls , shook the reinforced concrete of the <unk> as steam <unk> shake the flanks of a dock .
'i 'm all out  first time in my life .
ah !
tell a fellow now , did i get it across ? '
she whispered huskily .
'you know you did , ' i replied as she dipped her nose deep in a <unk> of <unk> .
'they cooed over you . '
bat nodded .
'and poor <name> 's dead  in africa , ai n't it ? '
'i <name> i 'll die before they stop cooing , ' said 'dal .
' " earth was flat  earth was flat ! " '
now it was more like <unk> in flood .
'they 'll have the house down if you do n't take another , ' some one called .
<unk> 'em ! '
said 'dal , and went out for her eighth , when in the face of that cataract she said yawning , 'i do n't know how you feel , children , but i 'm dead .
you be quiet . '
'hold a minute , ' said bat to me .
'i 've got to hear how it went in the provinces .
<name> <unk> had it in manchester , and <unk> at glasgow  and there are all the films too .
i had rather a heavy week-end . '
the <unk> presently reassured him .
'it 'll do , ' said he .
'and he said my home address was jerusalem . '
he left me humming the refrain of 'the holy city . '
like ollyett i found myself afraid of that man .
when i got out into the street and met the <unk> <unk> capering on the pavements and humming it ( for he had put the <unk> on with the films ) , and when i saw far to the south the red electrics flash <unk> ' across the thames , i feared more than ever .
* * * * * a few days passed which were like nothing except , perhaps , a suspense of fever in which the sick man perceives the <unk> of the world's assembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of wreckage  one only in all the black and <unk> sea .
then those beams focussed themselves .
earth as we knew it  the full circuit of our orb  laid the weight of its impersonal and <unk> curiosity on this huckley which had voted that it was flat .
it asked for news about huckley  where and what it might be , and how it talked  it knew how it danced  and how it thought in its wonderful soul .
and then , in all the zealous , merciless press , huckley was laid out for it to look at , as a drop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a <unk> show .
but huckley 's sheet was only <unk> with the use of type among mankind .
for the precise moment that was necessary , fate ruled it that there should be nothing of first importance in the world 's idle eye .
one atrocious murder , a political crisis , an <unk> or <unk> continental statesman , the mere <unk> of a king , would have wiped out the significance of our message , as a passing cloud <unk> the urgent <unk> .
but it was <unk> weather in every respect .
ollyett and i did not need to lift our little fingers any more than the alpine climber whose last sentence has <unk> the arch of the avalanche .
the thing roared and <unk> and swept beyond eyesight all by itself  all by itself .
and once well away , the fall of kingdoms could not have diverted it .
ours is , after all , a kindly earth .
while the song ran and <unk> it with the <unk> kick of <unk> , ' multiplied by the west african significance of <unk> 's doing it , ' plus twice the infernal <unk> of a certain tune in <name> et <unk> ; when for all practical purposes , literary , dramatic , artistic , social , municipal , political , commercial , and administrative , the earth was flat , the rector of huckley wrote to us  again as a lover of accuracy  to point out that the huckley vote on 'the alleged flatness of this scene of our labours here below ' was not unanimous ; he and the doctor having voted against it .
and the great baron <unk> himself ( i am sure it could have been none other ) flashed that letter in full to the front , back , and both wings of this scene of our labours .
for huckley was news .
the bun also contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake .
'we are a vital nation , ' said ollyett while we were discussing affairs at a bat dinner .
'only an englishman could have written that letter at this present juncture . '
'it reminded me of a tourist in the cave of the winds under niagara .
just one figure in a mackintosh .
but perhaps you saw our photo ? '
i said proudly .
'yes , ' bat replied .
'i 've been to niagara , too .
and how 's huckley taking it ? '
'they do n't quite understand , of course , ' said ollyett .
'but it's bringing pots of money into the place .
ever since the <unk> excursions were started  ' 'i did n't know they had been , ' said pallant .
'oh yes .
motor <unk>  uniformed guides and <unk> included .
they 're getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays , ' ollyett added .
'they play it under his windows , do n't they ? '
bat asked .
'he ca n't stop the right of way across his park . '
'he can not , ' ollyett answered .
'by the way , woodhouse , i 've bought that font for you from the sexton .
i paid fifteen pounds for it . '
'what am i supposed to do with it ? '
asked woodhouse .
'you give it to the <name> and <name> museum .
it is <unk> work all right .
you can trust me . '
'is it worth it  now ? '
said pallant .
'not that i 'm weakening , but merely as a matter of tactics ? '
'but this is true , ' said ollyett .
<unk> , it is my hobby , i always wanted to be an architect .
i 'll attend to it myself .
it 's too serious for the bun and miles too good for the cake . '
he broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly , which had never heard of huckley .
there was no passion in his statement , but mere fact backed by a wide range of authorities .
he established beyond doubt that the old font at huckley had been thrown out , on sir <unk> <unk> , twenty years ago , to make room for a new one of bath stone adorned with <unk> <unk> ; and that it had lain ever since in a corner of the sexton 's shed .
he proved , with learned men to support him , that there was only one other font in all england to compare with it .
so woodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful south kensington which said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the treasure to <unk> huckley .
bishops by the <unk> and most of the <name> academy , not to mention <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' wrote fervently to the papers .
punch based a political <unk> on it ; the times a third leader , 'the lust of newness ' ; and the spectator a scholarly and delightful middle , <unk> <unk> . '
the vast amused outside world said in all its tongues and types : 'of course !
this is just what huckley would do ! '
and neither sir <name> nor the rector nor the sexton nor any one else wrote to deny it .
'you see , ' said ollyett , 'this is much more of a blow to huckley than it looks  because every word of it 's true .
your <unk> dance was inspiration , i admit , but it had n't its roots in  ' 'two hemispheres and four continents so far , ' i pointed out .
<unk> roots in the hearts of huckley was what i was going to say .
why do n't you ever come down and look at the place ?
you 've never seen it since we were stopped there . '
'i 've only my <unk> free , ' i said , 'and you seem to spend yours there pretty regularly  with the <unk> .
i was afraid  ' 'oh , that's all right , ' he said cheerily .
'we 're quite an old engaged couple now .
as a matter of fact , it happened after " the <unk> <unk> <unk> " business .
come along this saturday .
woodhouse says he 'll run us down after lunch .
he wants to see huckley too . '
pallant could not accompany us , but bat took his place .
'it 's odd , ' said bat , 'that none of us except ollyett has ever set eyes on huckley since that time .
that 's what i always tell my people .
local colour is all right after you 've got your idea .
before that , it 's a mere nuisance . '
he <unk> us on the way down with <unk> views of the success  geographical and financial  of 'the <unk> ' and the song .
'by the way , ' said he , 'i 've assigned 'dal all the <unk> rights of " the earth . "
she 's a born artist .
'had n't sense enough to hit me for <unk> the morning after .
she 'd have taken it out in <unk> . '
<unk> her !
and what 'll she make out of the <unk> rights ? '
i asked .
<unk> knows ! '
he replied .
'i 've made fifty-four thousand my little end of the business , and it 's only just beginning .
hear that ! '
a <unk> <unk> roared up behind us to the music on a <unk> of 'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
in a few minutes we overtook another , in natural wood , whose occupants were singing it through their noses .
'i do n't know that agency .
it must be cook 's , ' said ollyett .
'they do suffer . '
we were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way to huckley .
though i knew it would be so , i was disappointed with the actual aspect of the spot we had  it is not too much to say  created in the face of the nations .
the <unk> pub ; the village green ; the baptist chapel ; the church ; the sexton 's shed ; the <unk> whence the <unk> letters had come ; sir <name> 's park <unk> still violently declaring 'the earth is flat , ' were as mean , as average , as ordinary as the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed .
ollyett , who , of course , knew the place specially well , made the most of it to us .
bat , who had employed it as a <unk> to one of his own dramas , dismissed it as a thing used and emptied , but woodhouse expressed my feelings when he said : 'is that all  after all we 've done ? '
'_i know , ' said ollyett soothingly .
' " like that strange song i heard apollo sing : when <unk> like a mist rose into towers . "
i 've felt the same sometimes , though it has been paradise for me .
but they do suffer . '
the fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into sir <unk> park to tell the hall that 'the earth was flat ' ; a knot of obviously american tourists were <unk> his <unk> ; while the <unk> opposite the <unk> was full of people buying <unk> of the old font as it had lain twenty years in the sexton 's shed .
we went to the <unk> pub and congratulated the proprietor .
'it 's bringin ' money to the place , ' said he .
'but in a sense you can buy money too dear .
it is n't doin ' us any good .
people are laughin ' at us .
that 's what they 're doin ' ... . now , with regard to that vote of ours you may have heard talk about ... <unk> 'for <unk> sake , <name> that <unk> ' business , ' cried an elderly man at the door .
<unk> ' or no <unk> ' , we 're fed up with it . '
'well , i do think , ' said the publican , shifting his ground , 'i do think sir <name> might <name> ' managed better in some things . '
'he tole me , '  the elderly man shouldered his way to the bar  'he tole me twenty years ago to take an ' lay that font in my <unk> .
he tole me so himself .
an ' now , after twenty years , me own wife makin ' me out little better than the common <unk> ! '
'that 's the sexton , ' the publican explained .
'his good <name> sells the <unk>  if you 'ave n't got some .
but we feel sir <name> might ha' done better . '
'what 's he got to do with it ? '
said woodhouse .
'there 's nothin ' we can trace 'ome to 'im in so many words , but we think he might 'ave saved us the font business .
now , in regard to that <unk> business  ' <unk> it !
oh , <name> it ! '
the sexton roared , 'or you 'll 'ave me <unk> my throat at <unk> .
'ere 's another parcel of <unk> ! '
a <unk> had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and women immediately descended .
we went out to look .
they bore rolled banners , a <unk> in three pieces , and , i specially noticed , a <unk> <unk> , such as is used on ships at sea .
<unk> army ? '
i said , though i saw no uniforms .
two of them <unk> a banner between poles which bore the legend : 'the earth is flat . '
woodhouse and i turned to bat .
he shook his head .
'no , no !
not me ... .
if i had only seen their costumes in advance ! '
'good lord ! '
said ollyett .
'it 's the genuine society ! '
the company advanced on the green with the precision of people well broke to these movements .
<unk> could not have been quicker with the <unk> rostrum , nor stewards with the <unk> .
almost before its <unk> had been kicked into their catches , certainly before the tourists by the <unk> had begun to move over , a woman sat down to it and struck up a hymn : hear ther truth our tongues are telling , spread ther light from shore to shore , god hath given man a dwelling flat and flat for evermore .
when ther primal dark retreated , when ther deeps were <unk> , he with rule and level <unk> habitation for mankind !
i saw sick envy on bat 's face .
<unk> nature , ' he muttered .
'she gets ahead of you every time .
to think i forgot hymns and a <unk> ! '
then came the chorus : hear ther truth our tongues are telling , spread ther light from shore to shore  oh , be faithful !
oh , be truthful !
earth is flat for evermore .
they sang several verses with the fervour of christians awaiting their lions .
then there were <unk> in the air .
the sexton , embraced by the landlord , <unk> out of the <unk> .
each was trying to <unk> the other .
<unk> in <unk> for what he says , ' the landlord shouted : 'you 'd better go away ' ( here the sexton began to speak words ) .
'this is n't the time nor yet the place for  for any more o ' this chat . '
the crowd thickened .
i saw the village <unk> come out of his cottage <unk> his belt .
'but surely , ' said the woman at the <unk> , 'there must be some mistake .
we are not <unk> . '
<unk> it !
they 'd be a change , ' cried the sexton .
'you get out of this !
do n't talk !
i ca n't stand it for one !
get right out , or we'll font you ! '
the crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the invitation .
the sergeant pushed forward .
a man beside the <unk> said : 'but surely we are among dear friends and <unk> .
listen to me for a moment . '
it was the moment that a passing <unk> chose to strike into the song .
the effect was instantaneous .
bat , ollyett , and i , who by divers roads have learned the psychology of crowds , retreated towards the tavern door .
woodhouse , the newspaper proprietor , anxious , i presume , to keep touch with the public , dived into the thick of it .
every one else told the society to go away at once .
when the <name> at the <unk> ( i began to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women ) pointed at the <unk> park pillars and called them 'the <unk> of our common <name> , ' there was a snarl and a rush .
the <unk> checked it , but advised the society to keep on going .
the society withdrew into the brake fighting , as it were , a rear-guard action of oratory up each step .
the collapsed <unk> was hauled in last , and with the perfect <unk> of crowds , they cheered it loudly , till the chauffeur slipped in his clutch and sped away .
then the crowd broke up , congratulating all concerned except the sexton , who was held to have disgraced his office by having sworn at ladies .
we strolled across the green towards woodhouse , who was talking to the <unk> near the <unk> .
we were not twenty yards from him when we saw sir <name> <unk> emerge from the lodge and rush furiously at woodhouse with an uplifted stick , at the same time shrieking : 'i 'll teach you to laugh , you  ' but ollyett has the record of the language .
by the time we reached them , sir <name> was on the ground ; woodhouse , very white , held the walking-stick and was saying to the sergeant : 'i give this person in charge for assault . '
'but , good lord ! '
said the sergeant , whiter than woodhouse .
'it 's sir <name> . '
<unk> it is , it is n't fit to be at large , ' said woodhouse .
the crowd suspecting something wrong began to <unk> , and all the english horror of a row in public moved us , headed by the sergeant , inside the lodge .
we shut both <unk> and <unk> .
'you saw the assault , sergeant , ' woodhouse went on .
'you can testify i used no more force than was necessary to protect myself .
you can testify that i have not even damaged this person 's property .
( here !
take your stick , you ! )
you heard the filthy language he used . '
'i  i ca n't say i did , ' the sergeant stammered .
'oh , but we did ! '
said ollyett , and repeated it , to the <unk> horror of the <unk> 's wife .
sir <name> on a hard kitchen chair began to talk .
he said he had <unk> enough of being photographed like a wild beast , ' and expressed loud regret that he had not killed 'that man , ' who was <unk> with the sergeant to laugh at him . '
<unk> you ever seen 'im before , sir <name> ? '
the sergeant asked .
'no !
but it 's time an example was made here .
i 've never seen the sweep in my life . '
i think it was bat masquerier 's magnetic eye that recalled the past to him , for his face changed and his jaw dropped .
'but i have ! '
he groaned .
'i remember now . '
here a writhing man entered by the back door .
he was , he said , the village solicitor .
i do not assert that he licked woodhouse 's boots , but we should have respected him more if he had and been done with it .
his notion was that the matter could be accommodated , arranged and compromised for gold , and yet more gold .
the sergeant thought so too .
woodhouse <unk> them both .
to the sergeant he said , 'will you or <name> you not enter the charge ? '
to the village solicitor he gave the name of his lawyers , at which the man wrung his hands and cried , 'oh , sir t. , sir t. ! '
in a miserable <unk> , for it was a bat masquerier of a firm .
they conferred together in tragic whispers .
'i do n't dive after dickens , ' said ollyett to bat and me by the window , 'but every time i get into a row i notice the <unk> always fills up with his characters . '
'i 've noticed that too , ' said bat .
'but the odd thing is you mustn't give the public straight dickens  not in my business .
i wonder why that is . '
then sir <name> got his second wind and cursed the day that he , or it may have been we , were born .
i feared that though he was a radical he might apologise and , since he was an m.p. , might lie his way out of the difficulty .
but he was utterly and truthfully beside himself .
he asked foolish questions  such as what we were doing in the village at all , and how much blackmail woodhouse expected to make out of him .
but neither woodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened .
the upshot of their talk , in the <unk> , was that sir <name> stood engaged to appear next monday before his brother magistrates on charges of assault , disorderly conduct , and language calculated , etc .
ollyett was specially careful about the language .
then we left .
the village looked very pretty in the late light  pretty and <unk> as a nest of <unk> .
'you 'll turn up on monday , i <name> , ' said woodhouse , when we reached town .
that was his only allusion to the affair .
so we turned up  through a world still singing that the earth was flat  at the little <unk> <unk> with the large corn exchange and the small jubilee memorial .
we had some difficulty in getting seats in the court .
woodhouse 's imported london lawyer was a man of commanding personality , with a voice trained to convey blasting <unk> by tone .
when the case was called , he rose and stated his client 's intention not to proceed with the charge .
his client , he went on to say , had not entertained , and , of course , in the circumstances could not have entertained , any suggestion of accepting on behalf of public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the part of sir <name> 's estate .
at the same time , no one acknowledged more sincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made by those entitled to make them .
but , as a matter of fact  here he became the man of the world <unk> with his equals  certain  er  details had come to his client 's knowledge since the lamentable outburst , which ...
he shrugged his shoulders .
nothing was served by going into them , but he ventured to say that , had those painful circumstances only been known earlier , his client would  again 'of course '  never have dreamed  a gesture concluded the sentence , and the <unk> bench looked at sir <name> with new and withdrawing eyes .
frankly , as they could see , it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with this  <unk> affair .
he asked leave , therefore , to withdraw the charge in <unk> , and at the same time to express his client 's deepest sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed , as his client had been , by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could , of course , again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of <unk> if , as he hoped he had made plain , certain facts had been before his client at the time when ... .
but he had said enough .
for his fee it seemed to me that he had .
heaven inspired sir <name> 's lawyer  all of a sweat lest his <unk> language should come out  to rise up and thank him .
then , sir <name>  not yet aware what <unk> had been laid upon him , but grateful to escape on any terms  followed suit .
he was heard in interested silence , and people <name> back a pace as <unk> passed forth .
'you hit hard , ' said bat to woodhouse afterwards .
'his own people think he 's mad . '
'you do n't say so ?
i 'll show you some of his letters to-night at dinner , ' he replied .
he brought them to the red <name> room of the chop <unk> .
we forgot to be amazed , as till then we had been amazed , over the song or 'the <unk> , ' or the full tide of fate that seemed to run only for our sakes .
it did not even interest ollyett that the verb 'to <unk> ' had passed into the english <unk> ' language .
we were studying the interior of a soul , <unk> to its <unk> corners by the dread of <unk> its position . '
'and then it thanked you , did n't it , for dropping the case ? '
said pallant .
'yes , and it sent me a telegram to confirm . '
woodhouse turned to bat .
'now d'you think i hit too hard ? '
he asked .
<unk> ! '
said bat .
'after all  i 'm talking of every one 's business now  one ca n't ever do anything in <name> that comes up to nature in any game in life .
just think how this thing has  ' 'just let me run through that little case of yours again , ' said pallant , and picked up the bun which had it set out in full .
'any chance of 'dal looking in on us to-night ? '
ollyett began .
'she 's occupied with her <name> too , ' bat answered bitterly .
'what 's the use of <name> ?
tell me , some one ! '
a <unk> outside promptly pointed out that the earth was flat .
'the <unk> 's killing street organs , but i let loose a <unk> of those <unk> twelve hours after the song , ' said bat .
'not counting the provinces . '
his face brightened a little .
'look here ! '
said pallant over the paper .
'i do n't suppose you or those <unk> <unk> 's knew it  but your lawyer ought to have known that you've all put your foot in it most <unk> over this assault case . '
'what 's the matter ? '
said woodhouse .
'it 's ludicrous .
it 's insane .
there is n't two <unk> of <unk> in the whole thing .
of course , you could have withdrawn the charge , but the way you went about it is childish  besides being illegal .
what on earth was the chief constable thinking of ? '
'oh , he was a friend of sir <name> 's .
they all were for that matter , ' i replied .
'he ought to be hanged .
so ought the chairman of the bench .
i 'm talking as a lawyer now . '
'why , what have we been guilty of ?
<unk> of treason or <unk> a felony  or what ? '
said ollyett .
'i 'll tell you later . '
pallant went back to the paper with knitted brows , smiling unpleasantly from time to time .
at last he laughed .
'thank you ! '
he said to woodhouse .
'it ought to be pretty useful  for us . '
'what d'you mean ? '
said ollyett .
'for our side .
they are all <unk> who are mixed up in this  from the chief constable down .
there must be a question .
there must be a question . '
'yes , but i wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way , ' woodhouse insisted .
'that 's nothing to do with the case .
it 's the <unk> of your silly methods .
you would n't understand if i talked till morning , ' he began to pace the room , his hands behind him .
'i wonder if i can get it through our whip 's thick head that it 's a chance ... . that comes of stuffing the bench with radical <unk> , ' he muttered .
'oh , sit down ! '
said woodhouse .
'where 's your lawyer to be found now ? '
he jerked out .
'at the <unk> , ' said bat promptly .
'i gave him the <unk> for to-night .
he 's an artist too . '
'then i 'm going to see him , ' said pallant .
<unk> handled this ought to be a <unk> for our side . '
he withdrew without apology .
'certainly , this thing keeps on opening up , and up , ' i remarked <unk> .
'it 's beyond me ! '
said bat .
'i do n't think if i 'd known i 'd have ever ...
yes , i would , though .
he said my home address was  ' 'it was his tone  his tone ! '
ollyett almost shouted .
woodhouse said nothing , but his face whitened as he brooded .
'well , any way , ' bat went on , 'i 'm glad i always believed in god and providence and all those things .
else i should lose my nerve .
we 've put it over the whole world  the full extent of the geographical globe .
we could n't stop it if we wanted to now .
it 's got to burn itself out .
i'm not in charge any more .
what d'you expect 'll happen next .
angels ? '
i expected nothing .
nothing that i expected approached what i got .
politics are not my concern , but , for the moment , since it seemed that they were going to <unk> ' with the rest , i took an interest in them .
they impressed me as a dog 's life without a dog 's <unk> , and i was confirmed in this when an unshaven and <unk> pallant called on me at ten o'clock one morning , begging for a bath and a couch .
<unk> too ? '
i asked .
he was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet in his head .
'no , ' he said hoarsely .
'all night sitting .
fifteen divisions .
<unk> to-night .
your place was nearer than mine , so  ' he began to undress in the hall .
when he awoke at one o'clock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said was history , but which was obviously collective hysteria .
there had been a political crisis .
he and his fellow m.p .
's had <unk> things '  i never quite got at the things  for eighteen hours on end , and the pitiless whips were even then at the <unk> to herd 'em up to another <unk> .
so he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have been resting .
'i 'm going to pitch in my question about that <unk> of justice at huckley this afternoon , if you care to listen to it , ' he said .
'it 'll be absolutely thrown away  in our present state .
i told 'em so ; but it 's my only chance for weeks .
p'raps woodhouse would like to come . '
'i 'm sure he would .
anything to do with huckley interests us , ' i said .
'it 'll miss fire , i 'm afraid .
both sides are absolutely cooked .
the present situation has been working up for some time .
you see the row was bound to come , etc .
etc. , ' and he flew off the handle once more .
i telephoned to woodhouse , and we went to the house together .
it was a dull , sticky afternoon with thunder in the air .
for some reason or other , each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the utmost .
i heard men snarling about it all round me .
'if they wo n't spare us , we 'll show 'em no <name> , ' <unk> the brutes up from the start .
they ca n't stand late hours . '
'come on !
no shirking !
i know you've had a turkish bath , ' were some of the sentences i caught on our way .
the house was packed already , and one could feel the negative electricity of a jaded crowd <unk> at one 's own nerves , and depressing the afternoon soul .
'this is bad ! '
woodhouse whispered .
'there 'll be a row before they've finished .
look at the front benches ! '
and he pointed out little personal signs by which i was to know that each man was on edge .
he might have spared himself .
the house was ready to snap before a bone had been thrown .
a sullen minister rose to reply to a <unk> question .
his supporters cheered defiantly .
'none o ' that !
none o ' that ! '
came from the back benches .
i saw the speaker 's face stiffen like the face of a helmsman as he humours a <unk> yacht after a sudden following sea .
the trouble was barely met in time .
there came a fresh , apparently <unk> gust a few minutes later  savage , threatening , but futile .
it died out  one could hear the sigh  in sudden <unk> <unk> of the dreary hours ahead , and the ship of state drifted on .
then pallant  and the raw house winced at the torture of his voice  rose .
it was a <unk> question , studded with legal technicalities .
the gist of it was that he wished to know whether the appropriate minister was aware that there had been a grave <unk> of justice on such and such a date , at such and such a place , before such and such <unk> of the peace , in regard to a case which arose  i heard one desperate , weary <unk> ! '
float up from the pit of that torment .
pallant sawed on  <unk> of certain events which occurred at the village of huckley . '
the house came to attention with a parting of the lips like a <unk> , and it flashed through my mind ... . pallant repeated , <unk> .
the village  ' 'that voted the earth was flat . '
a single voice from a back bench sang it once like a lone frog in a far pool .
<unk> was flat , ' croaked another voice opposite .
<unk> was flat . '
there were several .
then several more .
it was , you understand , the collective , <unk> nerve of the house , snapping , strand by strand to various notes , as the hawser parts from its moorings .
'the village that voted the earth was flat . '
the tune was beginning to shape itself .
more voices were raised and feet began to beat time .
even so it did not occur to me that the thing would  'the village that voted the earth was flat ! '
it was easier now to see who were not singing .
there were still a few .
of a sudden ( and this proves the fundamental instability of the <unk> mind ) a <unk> leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary <unk> with tremendous <unk> <unk> of the elbow .
the last strand parted .
the ship of state drifted out helpless on the rocking tide of <name> .
'the village that voted the earth was flat !
the village that voted the earth was flat ! '
the <name> first conceived the idea of using their <unk> as funnels wherewith to reach the correct <unk>  <unk> ' on <unk> . '
labour , always conservative and respectable at a crisis , stood out longer than any other section , but when it came in it was howling syndicalism .
then , without distinction of party , fear of constituents , <name> for office , or <name> of <unk> , the house sang at the tops and at the bottoms of their voices , swaying their stale bodies and <unk> beating with their swelled feet .
they sang 'the village that voted the earth was flat ' : first , because they wanted to , and secondly  which is the terror of that song  because they could not stop .
for no consideration could they stop .
pallant was still standing up .
some one pointed at him and they laughed .
others began to point , <unk> , as it were , in time with the tune .
at this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the speaker 's chair , and halted appalled .
one happened to be the prime minister and the other a messenger .
the house , with tears running down their cheeks , transferred their attention to the paralysed couple .
they pointed six hundred <unk> at them .
they rocked , they waved , and they rolled while they pointed , but still they sang .
when they weakened for an instant , ireland would yell : 'are ye with me , bhoys ? '
and they all renewed their strength like <unk> .
no man could say afterwards what happened in the press or the strangers ' gallery .
it was the house , the hysterical and abandoned house of commons that held all eyes , as it <unk> all ears .
i saw both front benches bend forward , some with their foreheads on their <unk> , the rest with their faces in their hands ; and their moving shoulders jolted the house out of its last rag of decency .
only the speaker remained unmoved .
the entire press of great britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head .
the <name> of the constitution , for vain was the help of man , foretold him the exact moment at which the house would have broken into 'the <unk> . '
he is reported to have said : 'i heard the <name> beginning to shuffle it .
so i adjourned . '
pallant 's version is that he added : 'and i was never so grateful to a private member in all my life as i was to mr .
pallant . '
he made no explanation .
he did not refer to orders or <unk> .
he simply adjourned the house till six that evening .
and the house adjourned  some of it nearly on all fours .
i was not correct when i said that the speaker was the only man who did not laugh .
woodhouse was beside me all the time .
his face was set and quite white  as white , they told me , as sir <name> <unk> 's when he went , by request , to a private interview with his chief whip .
the press the soldier may forget his sword the <unk> the sea , the <name> may forget the word and the priest his litany : the maid may forget both <name> and gem , and the bride her <unk>  but the jew shall forget jerusalem ere we forget the press !
who once hath stood through the loaded hour ere , roaring like the <name> , the <unk> and the hoe devour their <unk> paper bale , and has lit his pipe in the morning calm that follows the midnight stress  he hath sold his heart to the old black <name> we call the daily press .
who once hath dealt in the widest game that all of a man can play , no later love , no larger fame <name> lure him long away .
as the <unk> <unk> the battle afar , the entered soul , no less , he saith : <unk> !
<name> ! '
where the trumpets are and the thunders of the press .
canst thou number the days that we fulfil , or the times that we bring forth ?
canst thou send the lightnings to do thy <name> , and cause them reign on earth ?
hast thou given a peacock goodly wings to please his foolishness ?
sit down at the heart of men and things , companion of the press !
the pope may launch his <unk> , the union its decree , but the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked by us and such as we .
remember the battle and stand aside while thrones and powers confess that king over all the children of pride is the press  the press  the press !
in the presence ( <unk> ) 'so the matter , ' the regimental chaplain concluded , 'was correct ; in every way correct .
i am well pleased with rutton singh and <unk> singh .
they have gathered the fruit of their lives . '
he folded his arms and sat down on the verandah .
the hot day had ended , and there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines , where <unk> men went back and forth with leaf <unk> and <unk> .
the subadar-major , in extreme undress , sat on a chair , as befitted his rank ; the havildar-major , his nephew , leaning respectfully against the wall .
the regiment was at home and at ease in its own quarters in its own district which takes its name from the great muhammadan saint mian mir , revered by <unk> and beloved by guru har gobind , sixth of the great sikh <unk> .
<unk> correct , ' the regimental chaplain repeated .
no sikh <unk> his regimental chaplain who <unk> to him the holy book of the <unk> sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all the <unk> .
the subadar-major bowed his grey head .
the havildar-major coughed respectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak .
though he was the subadar-major 's nephew , and though his father held twice as much land as his uncle , he knew his place in the scheme of things .
the subadar-major shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist .
'was there by any chance any woman at the back of it ? '
the havildar-major murmured .
'i was not here when the thing happened . '
'yes !
yes !
yes !
we all know that thou wast in england eating and drinking with the sahibs .
we are all surprised that thou canst still speak punjabi . '
the subadar-major 's <unk> beard bristled .
'there was no woman , ' the regimental chaplain growled .
'it was land .
hear , you !
rutton singh and <unk> singh were the elder of four brothers .
these four held land in  what was the village 's name ?  oh , <unk> , near <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> state , where men can still recognise right behaviour when they see it .
the two younger brothers tilled the land , while rutton singh and <unk> singh took service with the regiment , according to the custom of the family . '
'true , true , ' said the havildar-major .
'there is the same arrangement in all good families . '
'then , listen again , ' the regimental chaplain went on .
<unk> kin on their mother 's side put great oppression and injustice upon the two younger brothers who stayed with the land in <unk> state .
their mother 's kin loosened beasts into the four brothers ' crops when the crops were green ; they cut the corn by force when it was ripe ; they broke down the <unk> ; they defiled the wells ; and they brought false charges in the law-courts against all four brothers .
they did not spare even the <unk> , as the saying is .
<unk> mother 's kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by weight of trouble , and further trouble and perpetual trouble , to quit their lands in <unk> village in <unk> <unk> in <unk> state .
if the young men ran away , the land would come whole to their mother 's kin .
i am not a regimental <unk> , but is it understood , child ? '
<unk> , ' said the havildar-major grimly .
<unk> is not the only place where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it .
but perhaps there was a woman among their mother 's kin ? '
'god knows ! '
said the regimental chaplain .
<unk> , or man , or law-courts , the young men would not be driven off the land which was their own by inheritance .
they made appeal to rutton singh and <unk> singh , their brethren who had taken service with us in the regiment , and so knew the world , to help them in their long war against their mother 's kin in <unk> .
for that reason , because their own land and the honour of their house was dear to them , rutton singh and <unk> singh needs must very often ask for leave to go to <unk> and attend to the <unk> and <unk> there .
'it was not , look you , as though they went back to their own village and sat , <unk> with <name> , in honour , upon chairs before the elders under the trees .
they went back always to perpetual trouble , either of <unk> , or theft , or strayed cattle ; and they sat on thorns . '
'i knew it , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> was bitter for them both .
but they were <unk> men .
it was not hard to get them their leave from the colonel sahib . '
'they spoke to me also , ' said the chaplain .
' " let him who desires the four great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men .
"  that is written .
often they showed me the papers of the false <unk> brought against them .
often they wept on account of the persecution put upon them by their mother 's kin .
men thought it was drugs when their eyes showed red . '
'they wept in my presence too , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> men of nine years ' service apiece .
rutton singh was <unk> , too . '
'they did all things correctly as sikhs should , ' said the regimental chaplain .
'when the persecution had endured seven years , <unk> singh took leave to <unk> once again ( that was the fourth time in that year only ) and he called his <unk> together before the village elders , and he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mother's blood to cease from their persecutions .
for he told them earnestly that he had marched to the boundaries of his <name> , and that there could be but one end to the matter .
'they gave him abuse .
they mocked him and his tears , which was the same as though they had mocked the regiment .
then <unk> singh returned to the regiment , and laid this last trouble before rutton singh , the eldest brother .
but rutton singh could not get leave all at once . '
'because he was <unk> and the recruits were to be drilled .
i myself told him so , ' said the subadar-major .
'he was a <unk> man .
he said he could wait . '
'but when permission was granted , those two took four days ' leave , ' the chaplain went on .
'i do not think <unk> singh should have taken <unk> sahib 's revolver .
he was <unk> sahib 's orderly , and all that sahib 's things were open to him .
it was , therefore , as i count it , shame to <unk> singh , ' said the subadar-major .
'all the words had been said .
there was need of arms , and how could soldiers use government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields ? '
the regimental chaplain replied .
<unk> , the revolver was sent back , together with a <unk> for the cartridges expended .
 " borrow not ; but if thou <unk> , pay back soon !
"  that is written in the hymns .
rutton singh took a sword , and he and <unk> singh went to <unk> and , after word given , the four brethren fell upon their <unk> in <unk> village and slew seventeen , wounding ten .
a revolver is better than a lawsuit .
i say that these four brethren , the two with us , and the two mere cultivators , slew and wounded twenty-seven  all their mother 's kin , male and female .
'then the four mounted to their <unk> , and <unk> singh , who was always one of the impetuous , said " my work is done , " and he made <unk> ( purification ) in all men 's sight , and he lent rutton singh <unk> sahib 's revolver , and rutton singh shot him in the head .
'so <unk> singh abandoned his body , as an insect <unk> a blade of grass .
but rutton singh , having more work to do , went down from the <unk> and sought an enemy whom he had forgotten  a <unk> man of this regiment who had sided with the <unk> .
when he overtook the man , rutton singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword . '
'but the man escaped and is now in the hospital here , ' said the subadar-major .
'the doctor says he <name> live in spite of all . '
'not rutton singh 's fault .
rutton singh left him for dead .
then rutton singh returned to the <unk> , and the three brothers together , <unk> singh being dead , sent word by a lad to the police station for an army to be dispatched against them that they might die with honours .
but none came .
and yet <unk> state is not under english law and they should know virtue there when they see it !
'so , on the third day , rutton singh also made <unk> , and the youngest of the brethren shot him also in the head , and he abandoned his body .
'thus was all correct .
there was neither heat , nor haste , nor abuse in the matter from end to end .
there remained alive not one man or woman of their mother 's kin which had oppressed them .
of the other villagers of <unk> , who had taken no part in the persecutions , not one was slain .
indeed , the villagers sent them food on the <unk> for those three days while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army .
'listen again !
i know that <unk> singh and rutton singh omitted no ceremony of the <unk> , and when all was done <unk> sahib's revolver was thrown down from the <unk> , together with three rupees twelve annas ; and order was given for its return by post . '
'and what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service ? '
the havildar-major asked .
<unk> they too are dead , but since they were not in the regiment their honour concerns themselves only .
so far as we were touched , see how correctly we came out of the matter !
i think the king should be told ; for where could you match such a tale except among us sikhs ?
<unk> wah guru <name> <unk> <unk> !
<unk> wah guru <name> <unk> <unk> !  ' said the regimental chaplain .
'would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges ? '
said the havildar-major .
<unk> singh knew the just price .
all <unk> sahib 's gear was in his charge .
they expended one tin box of fifty <unk> , lacking two which were returned .
as i said  as i say  the arrangement was made not with heat nor <unk> as a mussulman would have made it ; not with cries nor <unk> as an idolater would have made it ; but conformably to the ritual and doctrine of the sikhs .
hear you !
 " though hundreds of amusements are offered to a child it can not live without milk .
if a man be divorced from his soul and his soul 's <name> he certainly <name> not stop to play upon the road , but he <name> make haste with his pilgrimage . "
that is written .
i rejoice in my disciples . '
'true !
true !
correct !
correct ! '
said the subadar-major .
there was a long , easy silence .
one heard a <unk> creaking somewhere and the nearer sound of meal being ground in a <unk> .
'but he  ' the chaplain pointed a scornful <name> at the havildar-major  <unk> has been so long in england that  ' 'let the lad alone , ' said his uncle .
'he was but two months there , and he was chosen for good cause . '
theoretically , all sikhs are equal .
practically , there are differences , as none know better than well-born , <unk> folk , or <unk> <unk> from amritsar .
<unk> thou heard anything in england to match my tale ? '
the chaplain sneered .
'i saw more than i could understand , so i have locked up my stories in my own mouth , ' the havildar-major replied meekly .
<unk> ?
what stories ?
i know all the stories about england , ' said the chaplain .
'i know that <unk> run underneath their bazaars there , and as for their streets <unk> with <unk> <unk> , only this morning i was nearly killed by <unk> sahib 's <unk> .
that young man is a devil . '
'i expect <unk> , ' said the subadar-major , 'you and i grow too old to care for the <unk>  the bearer 's dance . '
he named one of the <unk> of the old-time <unk> , and smiled at his own pun .
then he turned to his nephew .
'when i was a lad and came back to my village on leave , i waited the convenient hour , and , the elders giving permission , i spoke of what i had seen elsewhere . '
'ay , my father , ' said the havildar-major , softly and affectionately .
he sat himself down with respect , as <unk> a mere lad of thirty with a bare half-dozen campaigns to his credit .
'there were four men in this affair also , ' he began , 'and it was an affair that touched the honour , not of one regiment , nor two , but of all the army in hind .
some part of it i saw ; some i heard ; but all the tale is true .
my father 's brother knows , and my priest knows , that i was in england on business with my colonel , when the king  the great queen's son  completed his life .
'first , there was a rumour that sickness was upon him .
next , we knew that he lay sick in the palace .
a very great multitude stood outside the palace by night and by day , in the rain as well as the sun , waiting for news .
'then came out one with a written paper , and set it upon a <unk>  the word of the king 's death  and they read , and groaned .
this i saw with my own eyes , because the office where my colonel sahib went daily to talk with colonel forsyth sahib was at the east end of the very gardens where the palace stood .
they are larger gardens than <unk> here '  he pointed with his <name> up the lines  'or <unk> across the river .
'next day there was a darkness in the streets , because all the <unk> multitude were clad in black garments , and they spoke as a man speaks in the presence of his dead  all those multitudes .
in the eyes , in the air , and in the heart , there was blackness .
i saw it .
but that is not my tale .
'after ceremonies had been accomplished , and word had gone out to the kings of the earth that they should come and mourn , the new king  the dead king 's son  gave commandment that his father 's body should be laid , <unk> , in a certain <name> which is near the river .
there are no idols in that <name> ; neither any carvings , nor paintings , nor <unk> .
it is all grey stone , of one colour as though it were cut out of the live rock .
it is larger than  yes , than the durbar sahib at amritsar , even though the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> were added .
how old it may be god knows .
it is the sahibs ' most sacred <name> .
'in that place , by the new king 's commandment , they made , as it were , a shrine for a saint , with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the dead , and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the night , until the dead king should be taken to the place of his fathers , which is at <unk> .
'when all was in order , the new king said , " give entrance to all people , " and the doors were opened , and o my uncle !
o my teacher !
all the world entered , walking through that <name> to take farewell of the dead .
there was neither distinction , nor price , nor ranking in the host , except an order that they should walk by fours .
'as they gathered in the streets without  very , very far off  so they entered the <name> , walking by fours : the child , the old man ; mother , virgin , harlot , trader , priest ; of all colours and faiths and customs under the firmament of god , from <name> till late at night .
i saw it .
my colonel gave me leave to go .
i stood in the line , many hours , one <unk> , two <unk> , distant from the <name> . '
'then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees ? '
asked the priest .
'because we were still between houses .
the city is many <unk> wide , ' the havildar-major resumed .
'i submitted myself to that <unk> river and thus  thus  a pace at a time  i made pilgrimage .
there were in my rank a woman , a cripple , and a lascar from the ships .
'when we entered the <name> , the coffin itself was as a shoal in the <unk> river , splitting the stream into two branches , one on either side of the dead ; and the watchers of the dead , who were soldiers , stood about it , moving no more than the still flame of the candles .
their heads were bowed ; their hands were clasped ; their eyes were cast upon the ground  thus .
they were not men , but images , and the multitude went past them in fours by day , and , except for a little while , by night also .
'no , there was no order that the people should come to pay respect .
it was a <unk> pilgrimage .
eight kings had been commanded to come  who obeyed  but upon his own sahibs the new king laid no commandment .
of themselves they came .
'i made pilgrimage twice : once for my salt 's sake , and once again for wonder and terror and worship .
but my mouth can not declare one thing of a hundred thousand things in this matter .
there were lakhs of lakhs , <unk> of <unk> of people .
i saw them . '
'more than at our great <unk> ? '
the regimental chaplain demanded .
'yes .
those are only cities and districts coming out to pray .
this was the world walking in grief .
and now , hear you !
it is the king 's custom that four swords of our armies in hind should stand always before the presence in case of need . '
'the king 's custom , our right , ' said the subadar-major curtly .
<unk> our right .
these honoured ones are changed after certain months or years , that the honour may be fairly spread .
now it chanced that when the old king  the <name> 's son  completed his days , the four that stood in the presence were goorkhas .
neither sikhs alas , nor pathans , rajputs , nor <unk> .
goorkhas , my father . '
<unk> , ' said the chaplain .
'but soldiers ; for i remember in the <unk>  ' the havildar-major began .
<unk> soldiers , for i remember fifteen campaigns .
go on , ' said the subadar-major .
'and it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in the presence by day and by night till it went out to burial .
there were no more than four all told  four old men to furnish that guard . '
'old ?
old ?
what talk is this of old men ? '
said the subadar-major .
'nay .
my fault !
your pardon ! '
the havildar-major spread a <unk> hand .
'they were strong , hot , valiant men , and the youngest was a lad of forty-five . '
'that is better , ' the subadar-major laughed .
'but for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food from the sahibs ' hands .
there was no cooking place in the <name> ; but a certain colonel forsyth sahib , who had understanding , made arrangement whereby they should receive at least a little <unk> parched grain ; also cold rice maybe , and water which was pure .
yet , at best , this was no more than a hen 's mouthful , snatched as each came off his guard .
they lived on grain and were thankful , as the saying is .
'one hour 's guard in every four was each man 's burden , for , as i have shown , they were but four all told ; and the honour of our armies in hind was on their heads .
the sahibs could draw upon all the armies in england for the other watchers  thousands upon thousands of fresh men  if they needed ; but these four were but four .
'the sahibs <name> upon the <unk> for the other watchers .
<unk> be very tall men under very tall <unk> , such as <unk> regiments wear in cold weather .
thus , when a <unk> bowed his head but a very little over his stock , the <unk> sloped and showed as though he grieved exceedingly .
now the goorkhas wear flat , green caps  ' 'i see , i see , ' said the subadar-major impatiently .
'they are <unk> , too ; and their stocks are hard , and when they bend deeply  deeply  to match the <unk>  they come nigh to choking themselves .
that was a handicap against them , when it came to the observance of ritual .
<unk> even with their tall , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> could not endure the full hour 's guard in the presence .
there was good cause , as i <name> show , why no man could endure that terrible hour .
so for them the hour 's guard was cut to one-half .
what did it matter to the sahibs ?
they could draw on ten thousand <unk> .
forsyth sahib , who had comprehension , put this choice also before the four , and they said , " no , ours is the honour of the armies of hind .
whatever the sahibs do , we <name> suffer the full hour . "
<unk> sahib , seeing that they were  knowing that they could neither sleep long nor eat much , said , " is it great suffering ? "
they said , " it is great honour .
we <name> endure . "
<unk> sahib , who loves us , said then to the eldest , " ho , father , tell me truly what manner of burden it is ; for the full hour 's watch breaks up our men like water . "
'the eldest answered , " sahib , the burden is the feet of the multitude that pass us on either side .
our eyes being lowered and fixed , we see those feet only from the knee down  a river of feet , sahib , that never  never  never stops .
it is not the standing without any motion ; it is not hunger ; nor is it the dead part before the <name> when maybe a single one comes here to weep .
it is the burden of the unendurable procession of feet from the knee down , that never  never  never stops ! "
<unk> sahib said , " by god , i had not considered that !
now i know why our men come trembling and twitching off that guard .
but at least , my father , ease the stock a little beneath the bent <name> for that one hour . "
'the eldest said , " we are in the presence .
moreover he knew every button and braid and hook of every uniform in all his armies . "
'then forsyth sahib said no more , except to speak about their parched grain , but indeed they could not eat much after their hour , nor could they sleep much because of <unk> and the renewed procession of the feet before the eyes .
yet they endured each his full hour  not half an hour  his one full hour in each four hours . '
<unk> !
correct ! '
said the subadar-major and the chaplain together .
'we come well out of this affair . '
'but seeing that they were old men , ' said the subadar-major reflectively , 'very old men , worn out by lack of food and sleep , could not arrangements have been made , or influence have been secured , or a petition presented , whereby a well-born sikh might have eased them of some portion of their great burden , even though his substantive rank  ' 'then they would most certainly have slain me , ' said the havildar-major with a smile .
'and they would have done correctly , ' said the chaplain .
'what befell the honourable ones later ? '
'this .
the kings of the earth and all the armies sent flowers and <unk> to the dead king 's palace at <unk> , where the funeral offerings were accepted .
there was no order given , but all the world made <unk> .
so the four took counsel  three at a time  and either they asked forsyth sahib to choose flowers , or themselves they went forth and bought flowers  i do not know ; but , however it was arranged , the flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great <unk> circle weighing half a <unk> .
<unk> sahib had said , " let the flowers be sent to <unk> with the other flowers which all the world is sending . "
but they said among themselves , " it is not fit that these flowers , which are the offerings of his armies in hind , should come to the palace of the presence by the hands of hirelings or messengers , or of any man not in his service . "
<unk> this , forsyth sahib , though he was much occupied with office-work , said , " give me the flowers , and i <name> steal a time and myself take them to <unk> . "
'the eldest said , " since when has forsyth sahib worn sword ? "
<unk> sahib said , " but always .
and i wear it in the presence when i put on uniform .
i am a colonel in the armies of hind . "
the eldest said , " of what regiment ? "
and forsyth sahib looked on the carpet and pulled the hair of his lip .
he saw the trap . '
<unk> sahib 's regiment was once the old <unk> pathans which was called  ' the subadar-major gave the almost forgotten title , adding that he had met them in such and such campaigns , when forsyth sahib was a young captain .
the havildar-major took up the tale , saying , 'the eldest knew that also , my father .
he laughed , and presently forsyth sahib laughed .
' " it is true , " said forsyth sahib .
" i have no regiment .
for twenty years i have been a clerk tied to a thick pen .
therefore i am the more fit to be your orderly and messenger in this business . "
'the eldest then said , " if it were a matter of my life or the honour of any of my household , it would be easy . "
and forsyth sahib joined his hands together , half laughing , though he was ready to weep , and he said , " enough !
i ask pardon .
which one of you goes with the offering ? "
'the eldest said , <unk> not to have heard , " nor must they be delivered by a single sword  as though we were pressed for men in his service , " and they saluted and went out . '
'were these things seen , or were they told thee ? '
said the subadar-major .
'i both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my colonel sahib consulted forsyth sahib upon the business that had brought my colonel sahib to england . '
'and what was that business ? '
the regimental chaplain asked of a sudden , looking full at the havildar-major , who returned the look without a quiver .
'that was not revealed to me , ' said the havildar-major .
'i heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of certain regiments , ' the chaplain insisted .
'the matter was not in any way open to my ears , ' said the havildar-major .
<unk> ! '
the chaplain <name> his hard <unk> feet under his robe .
'let us hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell , ' he said , and the havildar-major went on : 'so then the three , having returned to the <name> , called the fourth , who had only forty-five years , when he came off guard , and said , " we go to the palace at <unk> with the offerings .
remain thou in the presence , and take all our guards , one after the other , till we return . "
<unk> that next hour they hired a large and strong <unk> for the journey from the <name> to <unk> , which is twenty <unk> or more , and they promised expedition .
but he who took their guards said , " it is not seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste .
there are eighteen medals with eleven <unk> and three orders to consider .
go at leisure .
i can endure . "
'so the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half , and having delivered the offering at <unk> in the correct manner they returned and found the lad on guard , and they did not break his guard till his full hour was ended .
so he endured four hours in the presence , not stirring one hair , his eyes <unk> , and the river of feet , from the knee down , passing continually before his eyes .
when he was relieved , it was seen that his eyeballs worked like weavers ' <unk> .
'and so it was done  not in hot blood , not for a little while , nor yet with the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain , but in silence , for a very long time , rooted to one place before the presence among the most terrible feet of the multitude . '
<unk> ! '
the chaplain chuckled .
'but the goorkhas had the honour , ' said the subadar-major sadly .
<unk> was the honour of his armies in hind , and that was our honour , ' the nephew replied .
<unk> i would one sikh had been concerned in it  even one low-caste sikh .
and after ? '
'they endured the burden until the end  until it went out of the <name> to be laid among the older kings at <unk> .
when all was accomplished and it was withdrawn under the earth , forsyth sahib said to the four , " the king gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own cooks .
eat and take ease , my fathers . "
'so they loosed their belts and ate .
they had not eaten food except by snatches for some long time ; and when the meat had given them strength they slept for very many hours ; and it was told me that the procession of the unendurable feet ceased to pass before their eyes any more . '
he threw out one hand palm upward to show that the tale was ended .
'we came well and cleanly out of it , ' said the subadar-major .
<unk> !
correct !
correct ! '
said the regimental chaplain .
'in an evil age it is good to hear such things , and there is certainly no doubt that this is a very evil age . '
<unk> 's amen <unk> be the english and all their ways and works .
cursed be the infidels , <unk> , and turks ! '
<unk> , ' quo ' <unk> , 'but where i used to lie was neither candle , <name> nor book to curse my brethren by : 'but a <unk> in full bearing , bowing down , bowing down , to a surf that drove <unk> at the <unk> town  <unk> in a <name> , <unk> in a dome  and a low moon out of africa said : " this way home ! " '
<unk> be the english and all that they profess .
cursed be the savages that prance in nakedness ! '
<unk> , ' quo ' <unk> , 'but where i used to lie was neither shirt nor pantaloons to catch my brethren by : 'but a <unk> slowly creaking , going round , going round , by a <unk> leaking over drowned , warm ground  parrots very busy in the <unk> <unk>  and a high sun over <name> shouting : " rise and shine ! " '

cursed be the infidels that bow to wood and stone ! '

" '

cursed be the <unk> who doubt that this is true ! '

'
regulus ( <unk> ) regulus , a <name> general , defeated the carthaginians 256 <unk> , but was next year defeated and taken prisoner by the carthaginians , who sent him to rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners .
regulus strongly advised the <name> senate to make no terms with the enemy .
he then returned to carthage and was put to death. the fifth form had been dragged several times in its collective life , from one end of the school <name> to the other .
those were the years when army <unk> gave thousands of marks for latin , and it was mr. king 's hated business to defeat them .
hear him , then , on a raw november morning at second lesson .
'aha ! '
he began , rubbing his hands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our portion to-day is the fifth ode of the third book , i believe  concerning one regulus , a gentleman .
and how often have we been through it ? '
<unk> , sir , ' said <unk> , head of the form .
mr. king shuddered .
'yes , twice , quite literally , ' he said .
<unk> , with an eye to your army <unk> examinations  ugh !  i shall exact somewhat freer and more <unk> <unk> .
with feeling and comprehension if that be possible .
i except '  here his eye swept the back benches  'our friend and companion beetle , from whom , now as always , i demand an absolutely literal translation . '
the form laughed <unk> .
<unk> his blushes !
beetle charms us first . '
beetle stood up , confident in the possession of a guaranteed <unk> , left behind by <unk> , who had that day gone into the <unk> with a cold .
yet he was too wary a hand to show confidence .
<unk> , we  believe  we have believed , ' he opened in hesitating slow time , <unk> <unk> , thundering jove  <unk> , to reign  <unk> , in heaven .
<name> , <name>  <unk> , <name> be held or considered  <unk> <unk> , a present god  <unk> <unk> , the britons being added  <unk> , to the empire  <unk> <unk> , with the heavy  er , stern persians . '
'what ? '
'the grave or stern persians . '
beetle pulled up with the <unk> ' air of <name> in the <unk> .
'i am quite aware , ' said king , 'that the first stanza is about the extent of your knowledge , but continue , sweet one , continue .
<unk> , by the way , is usually translated as " troublesome . " '
beetle <name> a long and tortured breath .
the second stanza ( which carries over to the third ) of that ode is what is technically called a <unk> . '
but <unk> had done him handsomely .
<unk> <unk> , had  has the soldier of <unk>  <unk> , lived  <unk> <unk> , a disgraceful husband  ' 'you <unk> the quantity of the word after <unk> , ' said king .
<unk> hear it . '
beetle guessed again , and for a wonder hit the correct quantity .
'er  a disgraceful husband  <unk> <name> , with a barbarous spouse . '
'why do you select that <unk> equivalent out of all the dictionary ? '
king snapped .
'is n't " wife " good enough for you ? '
'yes , sir .
but what do i do about this <unk> , sir ?
shall i take it now ? '
<unk> yourself at present to the soldier of <unk> . '
'yes , sir .
et , and  <unk> , has he grown old  in <unk> , in the  er  arms  <unk> <unk> , of his father-in-law 's enemies . '
'who ?
how ?
which ? '
<unk> of his enemies ' <unk> , sir . '
<unk> .
by the way , what meaning might you attach to in <unk> ? '
'oh , weapons  weapons of war , sir . '
there was a <unk> note in beetle 's voice as though he had been falsely accused of uttering <unk> .
'shall i take the <unk> now , sir ? '
'since it seems to be troubling you . '
<unk> <unk> , o for the senate house  <unk> <unk> , and manners upset  upside down . '
<unk> like your translation .
meantime , the soldier of <unk> ? '
<unk> <unk> <unk> , under a median king  <unk> et <unk> , he being a <unk> and an <unk> . '
'who ?
the median king ? '
'no , sir .
the soldier of <unk> .
<unk> agrees with <unk> <unk> , sir , ' volunteered <unk> beetle .
'does it ?
it does n't with me . '
<unk> , ' beetle corrected hastily , <unk>  <unk> , of the shields , or trophies  et <unk> , and the  his name  et <unk> , and the <unk>  <unk> <unk> , and eternal <name>  <unk> jove , jove being safe  et <unk> <name> , and the <name> city . '
with an air of hardly restrained zeal  'shall i go on , sir ? '
mr. king winced .
'no , thank you .
you have indeed given us a translation !
may i ask if it conveys any meaning whatever to your so-called mind ? '
'oh , i think so , sir . '
this with gentle toleration for <name> and all his works .
'we envy you .
sit down . '
beetle sat down relieved , well knowing that a reef of <unk> <unk> stretched ahead of him , on which in spite of <unk> <unk> he would infallibly have been wrecked .
rattray , who took up the task , steered neatly through them and came unscathed to port .
'here we require drama , ' said king .
<unk> himself is speaking now .
who shall represent the <unk> regulus ?
winton , <name> you kindly oblige ? '
winton of king 's house , a long , heavy , <unk> second fifteen forward , <unk> for his first fifteen colours , and in aspect like an <name> , elderly horse , rose up , and announced , among other things , that he had seen <unk> affixed to punic deluges . '
half the form shouted for <name> , and the other half for <name> that there was something to shout about .
mr. king opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , ' he gasped .
'so <unk> is " deluges " is it ?
winton , in all our dealings , have i ever suspected you of a jest ? '
'no , sir , ' said the rigid and angular winton , while the form rocked about him .
'and yet you assert <unk> means " deluges . "
whether i am a fit subject for such a <unk> is , of course , a matter of opinion , but ... . winton , you are normally conscientious .
may we assume you looked out <unk> ? '
'no , sir . '
winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all who stand before kings .
<unk> a shot at it then ? '
every line of winton 's body showed he had done nothing of the sort .
indeed , the very idea that <unk> ' winton ( and a boy is not called <unk> ' by companions for his frivolity ) would make a shot at anything was beyond belief .
but he replied , 'yes , ' and all the while worked with his right heel as though he were <unk> a ball at <unk> .
though none dared to boast of being a favourite with king , the <unk> , three-cornered winton stood high in his house-master 's opinion .
it seemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment , but the two were in some fashion sympathetic .
<unk> ! '
said king drily .
'i was going to say  <unk> <unk> <unk> , but i think  i think i see the process .
beetle , the translation of <unk> , please . '
beetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer : <unk> , sir . '
there was an impressive pause while king checked off crimes on his fingers .
then to beetle the <unk> man addressed winged words : <unk> , ' said he .
<unk> , beetle , as usual , from the look of <unk> that it bore some relation to <unk> or deluge , you imparted the result of your <unk> <unk> to winton who seems to have been lost enough to have accepted it .
observing next , your companion 's fall , from the presumed security of your <unk> position in the rear-guard , you took another <unk> .
the turbid chaos of your mind threw up some memory of the word " <unk> " which you have pitifully attempted to disguise under the <unk> of " ruins . " '
as this was precisely what beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving .
'we <name> attend to this later , ' said king .
'go on , winton , and retrieve yourself . '
<unk> happened to be the one word which winton had not looked out and had asked beetle for , when they were settling into their places .
he forged ahead with no further trouble .
only when he rendered <unk> as <unk> , ' king erupted .
<unk> , ' he said , 'was not a <unk> for the <name> press , nor , for that matter , was <name> .
regulus says : " the soldier <unk> by gold <name> come keener for the fight  <name> he by  by gum ! "
that's the meaning of <unk> .
it indicates contempt  bitter contempt .
" forsooth , " forsooth !
you 'll be talking about " speckled beauties " and " eventually <unk> " next .
<unk> , what do you make of that doubled " <unk> ego  ego <unk> " ?
it was n't put in to fill up the metre , you know . '
'is n't it <unk> , sir ? '
said <unk> , afflicted by a genuine interest in what he read .
<unk> was a bit in <name> about rome making no terms with carthage  and he wanted to let the romans understand it , did n't he , sir ? '
'less than your usual <name> , but the fact .
regulus was in <name> .
he was also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every word he uttered .
he knew carthage which ( your <unk> wo n't ask you this so you need n't take notes ) was a sort of <unk> nigger manchester .
regulus was not thinking about his own life .
he was telling rome the truth .
he was playing for his side .
those lines from the eighteenth to the <unk> ought to be written in blood .
yet there are things in human garments which <name> tell you that <name> was a <unk>  a man about town .
avoid such beings .
<name> knew a very great deal .
he knew !
<unk> <unk> <unk>  " <name> he be brave who once to faithless foes has knelt ? "
and again ( stop pawing with your hooves , <unk> ! )
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that means roughly  but i perceive i am ahead of my <unk> .
begin at <unk> <unk> , <name> , and let us see if you have the spirit of regulus . '
now no one expected fireworks from gentle paddy <name> , <unk> of hartopp 's house , but , as must often be the case with growing boys , his mind was in abeyance for the time being , and he said , all in a rush , on behalf of regulus : <unk> magna <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , o carthage , thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of italy . '
even beetle , most lenient of critics , was interested at this point , though he did not join the <unk> of <unk> from the wiser heads of the form .
<unk> do n't mind me , ' said king , and <name> very kindly did not .
he ploughed on thus : 'he ( regulus ) is related to have removed from himself the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the head , and , being stern , to have placed his <unk> visage on the ground . '
since king loved <unk> ' about as much as he did <unk> ' or <unk> the form looked up hopefully .
but jove thundered not .
<unk> , ' <name> continued , 'he should have confirmed the sliding fathers as being the author of counsel never given under an alias . '
he stopped , conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the typhoon 's centre .
king 's opening voice was sweeter than <name> .
'i am painfully aware by bitter experience that i can not give you any idea of the passion , the power , the  the essential guts of the lines which you have so <unk> outraged in our presence .
but  ' the note changed , 'so far as in me lies , i <name> strive to bring home to you , <name> , the fact that there exist in latin a few pitiful rules of grammar , of <unk> , nay , even of <unk> , which were not created for your <unk> sport  your <unk> diversion .
you <name> , therefore , <name> , write out and bring to me to-morrow a <unk> <unk> translation of the ode , together with a full list of all adjectives  an adjective is not a verb , <name> , as the lower third <name> tell you  all adjectives , their number , case , and <unk> .
even now i have n't begun to deal with you faithfully . '
'i  i 'm very sorry , sir , ' <name> stammered .
'you mistake the symptoms , <name> .
you are possibly discomfited by the <unk> , but sorrow <unk> some sort of mind , intellect , nous .
your rendering of <unk> alone stamps you as lower than the beasts of the field .
<name> some one take the taste out of our mouths ?
and  talking of tastes  ' he coughed .
there was a distinct flavour of chlorine gas in the air .
up went an eyebrow , though king knew perfectly well what it meant .
'mr .
hartopp 's st  science class next door , ' said <unk> .
'oh yes .
i had forgotten .
our newly established modern side , of course .
perowne , open the windows ; and winton , go on once more from <unk> <unk> . '
'and hastened away , ' said winton , <unk> by his mourning friends , into  into illustrious banishment .
but i got that out of <unk> , sir , ' he added in one conscientious breath .
'i am aware .
the master generally knows his ass 's crib , though i acquit you of any intention that way .
can you suggest anything for <unk> <unk> ?
only " <unk> exile " ?
i fear " <unk> " is a good word ruined .
no !
you ca n't in this case improve on <unk> .
now then for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the whole force of it lies in the <unk> . '
<unk> he knew , ' winton suggested .
<unk> than that , i think . '
'he who knew well , ' <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
" well though he knew . "
i do n't like <unk> 's " <unk> . "
it 's <unk> street . '
'well though he knew what the savage <unk> was  was getting ready for him , ' said winton .
<unk> .
had in store for him . '
<unk> he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people <unk> his return . '
<unk> ; but then how do you render <unk> ? '
'if it 's a free translation might n't <unk> and <unk> come to about the same thing , sir ? '
'nothing comes to " about the same thing " with <name> , winton .
as i have said , <name> was not a journalist .
no , i take it that his kinsmen bodily withstood his departure , whereas the crowd  <unk>  the democracy stood about <unk> pitying him and getting in the way .
now for that noblest of <unk>  <unk> si <unk> , ' and king ran off into the quotation : 'as though some tedious business o'er of clients ' court , his journey lay towards <unk> 's grassy floor or <unk> tarentum 's bay .
all right , winton .
beetle , when you 've quite finished dodging the fresh air yonder , give me the meaning of <unk>  and turn down your collar . '
'me , sir ?
<unk> , sir ?
oh !
stretching away in the direction of , sir . '
<unk> !
regulus was not a feature of the landscape .
he was a man , <unk> to death by torture .
<unk> , <unk>  knowing it  having achieved it for his country 's sake  ca n't you hear that <unk> cut like a knife ?  he moved off with some dignity .
that is why <name> out of the whole golden latin tongue chose the one word " <unk> "  which is utterly <unk> . '
the gross injustice of being asked to translate it , converted beetle into a young <name> martyr , till king buried his nose in his handkerchief again .
'i think they 've broken another <unk> next door , sir , ' said <unk> .
'they 're always doing it . '
the form coughed as more chlorine came in .
'well , i suppose we must be patient with the modern side , ' said king .
'but it is almost insupportable for this side .
<name> , what are you grinning at ? '
<name> 's mind had returned to him glowing and inspired .
he chuckled as he <unk> his <name> .
'it appears to amuse you , ' said king .
'let us participate .
what is it ? '
'the last two lines of the tenth ode , in this book , sir , ' was <unk> amazing reply .
'what ?
oh , i see .
non <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> aut <unk> <unk> <unk> latus [ 2 ] . '
king 's mouth twitched to hide a grin .
'was that done with intention ? '
[ footnote 2 : 'this side <name> not always be patient of rain and waiting on the threshold . ' ]
'i  i thought it fitted , sir . '
'it does .
it 's distinctly happy .
what put it into your thick head , paddy ? '
'i do n't know , sir , except we did the ode last term . '
'and you remembered ?
the same head that <unk> <unk> as a verb !
<name> , you are an enigma .
no !
this side <name> not always be patient of <unk> gases and waters .
i <name> make representations to our so-called <unk> .
meantime ( who shall say i am not just ? )
i <unk> you your <unk> pains and penalties in regard to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> .
i ought n't to do it , but this side is occasionally human .
by no means bad , paddy . '
'thank you , sir , ' said <name> , wondering how inspiration had visited him .
then king , with a few brisk remarks about science , headed them back to regulus , of whom and of <name> and rome and <unk> commercial carthage and of the democracy eternally futile , he explained , in all ages and climes , he spoke for ten minutes ; passing thence to the next ode  <unk> <unk>  where he fetched up , <unk> , upon  <unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ( thou <unk> because thou <unk> thyself as lower than the gods )  making it a text for a discourse on manners , morals , and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases , which lasted till the <name> rang .
then beetle , <unk> his books , observed to winton , 'when king 's really on tap he 's an interestin ' dog .
hartopp 's chlorine <unk> him . '
'yes ; but why did you tell me <unk> was " deluges , " you silly ass ? '
said winton .
'well , that <unk> him too .
look out , you <unk> old owl ! '
winton had cleared for action as the form poured out like puppies at play and was <unk> beetle .
stalky from behind collared winton low .
the three fell in confusion .
<unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' quoth stalky , <unk> <unk> <unk> locks .
'must n't <unk> with number five study .
do n't be too virtuous .
do n't brood over it .
'two n't count against you in your future <unk> .
cheer up , pater . '
<unk> him off my  er  essential guts , <name> you ? '
said beetle from beneath .
'he 's <unk> ' 'em . '
they dispersed to their studies .
* * * * * no one , the owner least of all , can explain what is in a growing boy's mind .
it might have been the blind ferment of <unk> ; <unk> random remarks about virtue might have stirred him ; like his betters he might have sought popularity by way of <unk> ; or , as the head asserted years later , the only known jest of his serious life might have worked on him , as a <unk> man 's one love colours and <unk> all his after days .
but , at the next lesson , mechanical drawing with mr. <unk> who as <unk> had very limited powers of punishment , winton fell suddenly from <name> and let loose a live mouse in the form-room .
the whole form , shrieking and leaping high , threw at it all the plaster cones , pyramids , and fruit in high relief  not to mention <unk>  that they could lay hands on .
mr. <unk> reported at once to the head ; winton owned up to his crime , which , <unk> in the upper third , pardonable at a price in the lower fourth , was , of course , rank <unk> on the part of a fifth form boy ; and so , by graduated stages , he arrived at the head 's study just before lunch , penitent , <unk> , annoyed with himself and  as the head said to king in the corridor after the meal  more human than he had known him in seven years .
'you see , ' the head drawled on , <unk> 's only fault is a certain <unk> and <unk> virtue .
so this comes very happily . '
'i 've never noticed any sign of it , ' said king .
winton was in king's house , and though king as <unk> might , and did , <unk> oppress his own province , once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the hands of the imperial authority king fought for him to the very last steps of caesar 's throne .
'well , you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the occasion , ' the head answered .
'it was . '
mr. king did not love mr. <unk> .
'it should have been a rat .
but  but  i hate to plead it  it 's the lad 's first offence . '
'could you have damned him more completely , king ? '
<unk> .
what is the penalty ? '
said king , in retreat , but keeping up a rear-guard action .
'only my usual few lines of <name> to be shown up by tea-time . '
the head 's eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where mullins , captain of the games ( <unk> , ' 'old pot , ' or <unk> ' mullins ) , was pinning up the usual wednesday notice  <unk> , middle , and little side football  a to k , l to z , 3 to <unk> <unk> you can not write out the head 's usual few ( which means five hundred ) latin lines and play football for one hour and three-quarters between the hours of <unk> and 5 p.m. winton had evidently no intention of trying to do so , for he <name> about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy foot .
yet it was law in the school , compared with which that of the medes and persians was no more than a non-committal resolution , that any boy , outside the first fifteen , who missed his football for any reason whatever , and had not a written excuse , duly signed by competent authority to explain his absence , would receive not less than three strokes with a <unk> from the captain of the games , generally a youth between seventeen and eighteen years , rarely under eleven stone ( <unk> ' was nearer thirteen ) , and always in hard condition .
king knew without inquiry that the head had given winton no such excuse .
'but he is practically a member of the first fifteen .
he has played for it all this term , ' said king .
'i believe his cap should have arrived last week . '
'his cap has not been given him .
officially , therefore , he is naught .
i rely on old pot . '
'but mullins is winton 's <unk> , ' king persisted .
pot mullins and pater winton were cousins and rather close friends .
'that <name> make no difference to mullins  or winton , if i know 'em , ' said the head .
'but  but , ' king played his last card desperately , 'i was going to recommend winton for extra <unk> in my house , now <unk> has gone . '
'certainly , ' said the head .
'why not ?
he <name> be excellent by tea-time , i <name> . '
at that moment they saw mr. <unk> , tripping down the corridor , waylaid by winton .
'it 's about that <unk> at mechanical drawing , ' winton opened , swinging across his path .
'yes , yes , highly disgraceful , ' mr. <unk> panted .
'i know it was , ' said winton .
'it  it was a cad 's trick because  ' 'because you knew i could n't give you more than fifty lines , ' said mr. <unk> .
'well , anyhow i 've come to apologise for it . '
'certainly , ' said mr. <unk> , and added , for he was a kindly man , 'i think that shows quite right feeling .
i 'll tell the head at once i'm satisfied . '
'no  no ! '
the boy 's still <unk> voice jumped from the growl to the squeak .
'i did n't mean that !
i  i did it on principle .
please do n't  er  do anything of that kind . '
mr. <unk> looked him up and down and , being an artist , understood .
'thank you , winton , ' he said .
'this shall be between ourselves . '
'you heard ? '
said king , indecent pride in his voice .
'of course .
you thought he was going to get <unk> to beg him off the <unk> . '
king denied this with so much warmth that the head laughed and king went away in a <unk> .
'by the way , ' said the head , 'i 've told winton to do his lines in your form-room  not in his study . '
<unk> , ' said king over his shoulder , for the head 's orders had saved winton and mullins , who was doing extra army work in the study , from an embarrassing afternoon together .
an hour later , king wandered into his still form-room as though by accident .
winton was hard at work .
'aha ! '
said king , rubbing his hands .
'this does not look like games , winton .
do n't let me arrest your facile pen .
whence this sudden love for <name> ? '
<unk> from the head , sir , for that <unk> this morning . '
<unk> thereof have reached us .
that was a lapse on your part into lower <unk> which i do n't quite understand . '
the <unk> ' of the <unk> before the sides settled to games came through the open window .
winton , like his house-master , loved fresh air .
then they heard paddy <name> , <unk> on duty , calling the roll in the field and marking <unk> .
winton wrote steadily .
king curled himself up on a desk , hands round knees .
one would have said that the man was <unk> over the boy 's misfortune , but the boy understood .
<unk> te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' king quoted presently .
'it is necessary to bear oneself as lower than the local gods  even than <unk> who are <unk> from effective retaliation .
i do wish you 'd tried that <unk> with me , pater . '
winton grinned ; then sobered 'it was a cad 's trick , sir , to play on mr .
<unk> . '
he peered forward at the <name> he was copying .
'well , " the sin i <unk> to each <unk> ghost "  ' king stopped himself .
'why do you <unk> like an owl ?
hand me the <unk> and i'll dictate .
no matter .
any <name> <unk> measures <name> serve .
i may peradventure recall a few . '
he began : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> memento <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> .
there you have it all , winton .
write that out twice and yet once again . '
for the next forty minutes , with never a glance at the book , king paid out the glorious <unk> ( and king could read latin as though it were alive ) , winton hauling them in and <unk> them away behind him as <unk> in a <unk> 's hold coil away deep-sea cable .
king broke from the <unk> to the <unk> and back again , pausing now and then to translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the <unk> texture of the ancient fabric .
he did not allude to the coming interview with mullins except at the last , when he said , 'i think at this juncture , pater , i need not ask you for the precise significance of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '
the ungrateful winton flushed angrily , and king loafed out to take five o'clock <unk> , after which he invited little hartopp to tea and a talk on <unk> .
hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam , and the two went up to king 's study about the same time as winton returned to the form-room beneath it to finish his lines .
then half a dozen of the second fifteen , who should have been washing , strolled in to <unk> with <unk> ' winton , whose misfortune and its consequences were common talk .
no one was more sincere than the long , red-headed , <unk> <unk> ' <name> , but , being a careless animal , he <unk> winton 's desk .
<unk> you for a silly ass ! '
said winton .
'do n't do that . '
no one is expected to be polite while under punishment , so <name> , sinking his <unk> , replied peacefully enough : 'well , do n't be <unk> , pater . '
'i 'm not , ' said winton .
'get out !
this ai n't your house form-room . '
<unk> do n't belong to you .
why do n't you go to your own study ? '
<name> replied .
'because mullins is there waitin ' for the victim , ' said stalky delicately , and they all laughed .
'you ought to have shaken that mouse out of your <unk> , pater .
that 's the way i did in my youth .
pater 's <unk> ' to his second childhood .
never mind , pater , we all respect you and your future <unk> . '
winton , still writhing , growled .
<name> leaning on the desk somehow shook it again .
then he laughed .
'what are you grinning at ? '
winton asked .
'i was only thinkin ' of you being sent up to take a lickin ' from pot .
i swear i do n't think it 's fair .
you 've never shirked a game in your life , and you 're as good as in the first fifteen already .
your cap ought to have been delivered last week , ought n't it ? '
it was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the privileges and <unk> of the first fifteen till the black <name> cap with the gold <unk> , made by <unk> exeter <unk> , had been actually set on his head .
ages ago , a <unk> and <unk> second fifteen had attempted to change this law , but the prefects of that age were still larger , and the lively experiment had never been repeated .
'will you , ' said winton very slowly , <unk> mind your own damned business , you cursed , clumsy , <unk> fool ? '
the form-room was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside .
<name> shifted his feet uneasily .
'well , i should n't like to take a lickin ' from pot , ' he said .
'would n't you ? '
winton asked , as he <unk> the sheets of lines with hands that shook .
'no , i should n't , ' said <name> , his <unk> growing more distinct on the bridge of his white nose .
'well , i 'm going to take it '  winton moved clear of the desk as he spoke .
'but you're going to take a lickin ' from me first . '
before any one realised it , he had flung himself neighing against <name> .
no <unk> were observed on either side , and the rest looked on amazed .
the two met confusedly , <name> trying to do what he could with his longer reach ; winton , insensible to blows , only concerned to drive his enemy into a corner and batter him to pulp .
this he managed over against the fire-place , where <name> dropped <unk> .
'now i 'm going to give you your lickin ' , ' said winton .
<unk> there till i get a <unk> and i 'll cut you to pieces .
if you move , i 'll <name> you out of the window . '
he wound his hands into the boy 's collar and <unk> , and had actually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one accord dropped on his head , shoulders , and legs .
he fought them <unk> in an awful hissing silence .
stalky 's sensitive nose was rubbed along the floor ; beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling and crowing against the wall ; perowne 's forehead was cut , and <unk> came out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through a whole week .
<unk> !
quite mad ! '
said stalky , and for the third time wriggled back to winton 's throat .
the door opened and king came in , hartopp 's little figure just behind him .
the mound on the floor panted and heaved but did not rise , for winton still squirmed <unk> .
'only a little play , sir , ' said perowne .
<unk> hit my head against a form . '
this was quite true .
'oh , ' said king .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , i presume , are the <unk> <unk> winton 's return to  mullins , eh ? '
'no , sir , ' said stalky behind his <unk> handkerchief .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> . '
'not bad !
you see , some of it sticks after all , ' king chuckled to hartopp , and the two masters left without further inquiries .
the boys sat still on the <unk> winton .
'well , ' said stalky at last , 'of all the putrid <unk> , pater , you are the  ' 'i 'm sorry .
i 'm awfully sorry , ' winton began , and they let him rise .
he held out his hand to the bruised and bewildered <name> .
'sorry , paddy .
i  i must have lost my temper .
i  i do n't know what 's the matter with me . '
<unk> lot of good that 'll do my face at tea , ' <name> grunted .
'why could n't you say there was something wrong with you instead of <unk> out like a lunatic ?
is my lip puffy ? '
'just a trifle .
look at my beak !
well , we got all these pretty marks at <unk>  <unk> ' to the zeal with which we played the game , ' said stalky , dusting himself .
'but d'you think you 're fit to be let loose again , pater ?
'sure you do n't want to kill another <unk> ?
i wish i was pot .
i 'd cut your <unk> young soul out . '
'i s'pose i ought to go to pot now , ' said winton .
'and let all the other asses see you lookin ' like this !
not much .
we'll all come up to number five study and wash off in hot water .
beetle , you are n't damaged .
go along and light the <unk> . '
'there 's a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere , ' perowne shouted after him .
<unk> round till you find it , and take it up . '
separately , by different roads , <name> 's jersey pulled half over his head , the boys repaired to number five study .
little hartopp and king , i am sorry to say , leaned over the <unk> of king 's landing and watched .
<unk> human , ' said little hartopp .
'your virtuous winton , having got himself into trouble , takes it out of my poor old paddy .
i wonder what precise lie paddy <name> tell about his face . '
'but surely you are n't going to embarrass him by asking ? '
said king .
<unk> boy won , ' said hartopp .
'to go back to what we were discussing , ' said king quickly , 'do you pretend that your modern system of <unk> unrelated facts about chlorine , for instance , all of which may be proved <unk> by the time the boys grow up , can have any real bearing on education  even the low type of it that <unk> expect ? '
'i maintain nothing .
but is it any worse than your chinese <unk> of <unk> syllables in a dead tongue ? '
<unk> , forsooth ! '
king fairly danced .
'the only living tongue on earth !
chinese !
on my word , hartopp ! '
'and at the end of seven years  how often have i said it ? '
hartopp went on ,  <unk> years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each , your victims go away with nothing , absolutely nothing , except , perhaps , if they 've been very attentive , a dozen  no , i 'll <name> you twenty  one score of totally unrelated latin <unk> which any child of twelve could have absorbed in two terms . '
'but  but ca n't you realise that if our system brings later  at any rate  at a pinch  a simple understanding  grammar and <unk> apart  a mere glimpse of the significance ( foul word ! )
of , we 'll say , one ode of <name> , one twenty lines of <name> , we 've got what we poor devils of ushers are striving after ? '
'and what might that be ? '
said hartopp .
<unk> , proportion , perspective  life .
your scientific man is the unrelated animal  the beast without background .
have n't you ever realised that in your atmosphere of stinks ? '
<unk> you make them lose life for the sake of living , eh ? '
<unk> again , hartopp !
i told you about paddy 's quotation this morning .
( but he made <unk> a verb , he did ! )
you yourself heard young corkran 's reference to <unk> <unk> .
it sticks  a little of it sticks among the barbarians . '
<unk> and essentially chinese , ' said little hartopp , who , alone of the common-room , refused to be <unk> by king .
'but i do n't yet understand how paddy came to be licked by winton .
paddy 's supposed to be something of a boxer . '
<unk> of vinegar made from <name> , ' king replied .
<unk> , like some other people , is patient and long-suffering , but he has his limits .
the head is <unk> him <unk> , too .
as i pointed out , the boy has practically been in the first fifteen since term began . '
'but , my dear fellow , i 've known you give a boy an <unk> and refuse him leave off games , again and again . '
'ah , but that was when there was real need to get at some <unk> who could n't be <unk> in any other way .
now , in our esteemed <unk> action i see nothing but  ' the conversation from this point does not concern us .
meantime winton , very penitent and especially polite towards <name> , was being cheered with cocoa in number five study .
they had some difficulty in <unk> the flood of his apologies .
he himself pointed out to <name> that he had attacked a <unk> for no reason whatever , and , therefore , deserved official punishment .
'i ca n't think what was the matter with me to-day , ' he mourned .
<unk> since that blasted <unk>  ' 'well , then , do n't think , ' said stalky .
'or do you want paddy to make a row about it before all the school ? '
here <name> was understood to say that he would see winton and all the school somewhere else .
'and if you imagine perowne and <unk> and me are goin ' to give evidence at a prefects ' meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience , you jolly well err , ' said beetle .
'i know what you did . '
'what ? '
croaked pater , out of the valley of his humiliation .
'you went <unk> .
i 've read all about it in <unk> . '
'what 's " going <unk> " ? '
winton asked .
'never you mind , ' was the reply .
'now , do n't you feel awfully weak and seedy ? '
'i am rather tired , ' said winton , sighing .
'that 's what you ought to be .
you 've gone <unk> and pretty soon you'll go to sleep .
but you 'll probably be liable to fits of it all your life , ' beetle concluded .
<unk> n't wonder if you murdered some one some day . '
<unk> up  you and your <unk> ! '
said stalky .
'go to mullins now and get it over , pater . '
'i call it filthy unjust of the head , ' said <name> .
<unk> , you've given me my lickin ' , old man .
i <name> pot 'll give you yours . '
'i 'm awfully sorry  awfully sorry , ' was winton 's last word .
it was the custom in that <unk> to deal with games ' <unk> between five o'clock <unk> and tea .
mullins , who was old enough to pity , did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the chill of the next morning for their punishments .
he was finishing off the last of the small fry and their excuses when winton arrived .
'but , please , mullins '  this was <unk> tertius , a dear little <unk> mother 's darling  'i had an awful hack on the knee .
i've been to the matron about it and she gave me some iodine .
i 've been rubbing it in all day .
i thought that would be an excuse off . '
'let 's have a look at it , ' said the impassive mullins .
'that 's a <unk>  about a week old .
touch your toes .
i 'll give you the iodine . '
<unk> yelled loudly as he had many times before .
the face of <unk> , aged eleven , a new boy that dark wet term , low in the house , low in the lower school , and lowest of all in his <unk> little mind turned white at the horror of the sight .
they could hear his working lips part <unk> as <unk> wailed his way out of hearing .
<unk> , <unk> !
what brings you here ? '
said mullins .
<unk> , sir , i went for a walk with <unk> tertius . '
'did you ?
then i bet you went to the <unk>  and you paid , didn't you ? '
a nod .
<unk> was too terrified to speak .
'of course , and i bet <unk> told you that old pot 'ud let you off because it was the first time . '
another nod with a ghost of a smile in it .
'all right . '
mullins picked <unk> up before he could guess what was coming , laid him on the table with one hand , with the other gave him three emphatic <unk> , then held him high in air .
'now you tell <unk> tertius that he 's got you a licking from me , and see you jolly well pay it back to him .
and when you 're prefect of games do n't you let any one shirk his <unk> without a written excuse .
where d'you play in your game ? '
<unk> , sir . '
'you can do better than that .
i 've seen you run like a young <unk> .
ask <unk> from me to try you as <unk> next game , <name> you ?
cut along . '
<unk> left , warm for the first time that day , enormously set up in his own esteem , and very hot against the deceitful <unk> .
mullins turned to winton .
'your name 's on the list , pater . '
winton nodded .
'i know it .
the head landed me with an <unk> for that <unk> at mechanical drawing .
no excuse . '
'he meant it then ? '
mullins jerked his head delicately towards the <unk> on the table .
'i heard something about it . '
winton nodded .
'a rotten thing to do , ' he said .
'ca n't think what i was doing ever to do it .
it counts against a fellow so ; and there 's some more too  ' 'all right , pater .
just stand clear of our <unk> , <name> you ? '
the little formality over , there was a pause .
winton swung round , yawned in pot 's astonished face and staggered towards the window-seat .
'what 's the matter with you , <name> ?
ill ? '
'no .
perfectly all right , thanks .
only  only a little sleepy . '
winton stretched himself out , and then and there fell deeply and placidly asleep .
'it is n't a faint , ' said the experienced mullins , 'or his pulse wouldn't act .
't is n't a fit or he 'd snort and twitch .
it ca n't be sunstroke , this term , and he has n't been <unk> for anything . '
he opened <unk> collar , packed a cushion under his head , threw a rug over him and sat down to listen to the regular breathing .
before long stalky arrived , on pretence of borrowing a book .
he looked at the window-seat .
<unk> anything wrong with winton lately ? '
said mullins .
<unk> anything wrong with my beak ? '
stalky replied .
<unk> went <unk> after <unk> , and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him about his <unk> .
you ought to see <unk> 's eye . '
'you mean that pater fought ? '
said mullins .
'like a devil .
then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now .
i expect he 'll be all right when he wakes up .
rummy business !
conscientious old <unk> .
you ought to have heard his apologies . '
'but pater ca n't fight one little bit , ' mullins repeated .
"twas n't fighting .
he just tried to murder every one . '
stalky described the affair , and when he left mullins went off to take counsel with the head , who , out of a cloud of blue smoke , told him that all would yet be well .
<unk> , ' said he , 'is a little stiff in his moral joints .
he 'll get over that .
if he asks you whether to-day 's doings <name> count against him in his  ' 'but you know it 's important to him , sir .
his people are n't  very well off , ' said mullins .
'that 's why i 'm taking all this trouble .
you must reassure him , pot .
i have <unk> him with new experiences .
oh , by the way , has his cap come ? '
'it came at dinner , sir . '
mullins laughed .
sure enough , when he waked at tea-time , winton proposed to take mullins all through every one of his day 's lapses from <name> , and 'do you think it <name> count against me ? '
said he .
'do n't you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career , ' said mullins .
'you 're all right .
and oh  here 's your first cap at last .
shove it up on the <unk> and come on to tea . '
they met king on their way , stepping statelily and rubbing his hands .
'i have applied , ' said he , 'for the services of an additional <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> absence .
your name , winton , seems to have found favour with the powers that be , and  and all things considered  i am disposed to give my support to the nomination .
you are therefore a <unk> . '
'then it did n't count against me , ' winton gasped as soon as they were out of hearing .
a captain of games can jest with a <unk> publicly .
'you utter ass ! '
said mullins , and caught him by the back of his stiff neck and ran him down to the hall where the <unk> , who sit below the salt , made him welcome with the economical <unk> of <unk> .
king and little hartopp were <unk> in the reverend <name> <unk> study at 10 p.m.  classical <unk> modern as usual .
<unk>  proportion  background , ' snarled king .
'that is the essence of the <unk> . '
<unk> of <unk> , ' little hartopp answered .
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> behind the soda-water .
'you men oppress me .
hartopp , what did you say to paddy in your dormitories to-night ?
even you could n't have overlooked his face . '
'but i did , ' said hartopp calmly .
'i was n't even humorous about it as some <unk> might have been .
i went straight through and said naught . '
'poor paddy !
now , for my part , ' said king , 'and you know i am not lavish in my praises , i consider winton a first-class type ; absolutely first-class . '
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> .
<unk> of the second class , i admit .
the very best type of second class but '  he shook his head  'it should have been a rat .
pater 'll never be anything more than a colonel of engineers . '
'what do you base that verdict on ? '
said king stiffly .
'he came to me after prayers  with all his conscience . '
'poor old pater .
was it the mouse ? '
said little hartopp .
'that , and what he called his uncontrollable temper , and his responsibilities as <unk> . '
'and you ? '
'if we had had what is <unk> called a <unk> he 'd have had hysterics .
so i recommended a dose of <unk> salts .
he 'll take it , too  conscientiously .
do n't eat me , king .
perhaps , he 'll be a <unk> . '
ten o'clock struck and the army class boys in the further studies coming to their houses after an hour 's extra work passed along the gravel path below .
some one was chanting , to the tune of <unk> sand and grey sand , ' dis te <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
he stopped outside mullins ' study .
they heard mullins ' window slide up and then stalky 's voice : 'ah !
<unk> , mullins , my <unk> <unk> .
we 're the waits .
we have come to inquire after the local <unk> .
is he doin ' as well as can be expected in his new <unk> ? '
'better than you <name> , in a sec , stalky , ' mullins grunted .
<unk> of that .
we thought he 'd like to know that paddy has been carried to the <unk> in <unk> ' delirium .
they think it 's concussion of the <name> . '
'why , he was all right at prayers , ' winton began earnestly , and they heard a laugh in the background as mullins slammed down the window .
<unk> , regulus , ' stalky sang out , and the light footsteps went on .
'you see .
it sticks .
a little of it sticks among the barbarians , ' said king .
<unk> , ' said the reverend <name> .
'go to bed . '
a translation <name> , <unk> .
v. ode 3 there are whose study is of smells , and to attentive schools rehearse how something mixed with something else makes something worse .
some cultivate in <unk> impure the clients of our body  these , increasing without <name> , cure , or cause , disease .
others the heated wheel <unk> , and all its offspring , whose concern is how to make it farthest roll and fastest turn .
me , much <unk> if the hour present , or to be paid for , brings me to <unk> by the power of wheels or wings ; me , in whose breast no flame hath burned life-long , save that by pindar lit , such <name> leaves cold : i am not turned aside to it more than when , sunk in thought profound of what the <unk> gods require , my steward ( friend but slave ) brings round logs for my fire .
the edge of the evening ( 1913 ) ah !
what avails the classic bent , and what the chosen word , against the <unk> incident that actually occurred ?
and what is <name> <unk> we press through paint and prose and rhyme  when nature in her nakedness defeats us every time ?
'hi !
hi !
hold your horses !
stop ! ...
well !
well ! '
a <name> man in a <unk> overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up pall mall .
'you do n't know me ?
you 're excusable .
i was n't wearing much of anything last time we met  in south africa . '
the scales fell from my eyes , and i saw him once more in a sky-blue army shirt , behind barbed wire , among dutch prisoners bathing at <unk> , more than a dozen years ago [ 3 ] .
'why , it 's zigler  <unk> o .
zigler ! '
i cried .
'well , i am glad to see you . '
[ footnote 3 : 'the captive ' : <unk> and discoveries . ]
'oh no !
you do n't work any of your english on me .
" so glad to see you , <unk> know  an ' <unk> ! "
do you reside in this village ? '
'no .
i 'm up here buying stores . '
'then you take my automobile .
where to ? ...
oh , i know them !
my lord <unk> is one of the directors .
<unk> , drive to the army and navy <unk> supply association limited , <name> street , <unk> . '
he settled himself on the deep <unk> <unk> cushions , and his smile was like the turning on of all the electrics .
his teeth were whiter than the <name> fittings .
he smelt of rare soap and cigarettes  such cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an automatic lighter .
on my side of the car was a <unk> mirror , card and <unk> case .
i looked at him inquiringly .
'yes , ' he nodded , 'two years after i quit the cape .
she 's not an ohio girl , though .
she 's in the country now .
is that right ?
she 's at our little place in the country .
we 'll go there as soon as you 're through with your <unk> .
engagements ?
the only engagement you 've got is to grab your grip  get your bag from your hotel , i mean  and come right along and meet her .
you are the captive of my bow and spear now . '
'i surrender , ' i said meekly .
'did the zigler automatic gun do all this ? '
i pointed to the car fittings .
<unk> !
think of your <unk> ' that !
well , no .
the zigler is a great gun  the greatest ever  but life 's too short , an ' too interestin ' , to squander on pushing her in military society .
i 've leased my rights in her to a <unk> citizen full of <unk> and moral uplift .
if those things weigh with the <unk> of europe , he <name> make good and  i shall be surprised .
excuse me ! '
he bared his head as we passed the statue of the great <name> outside buckingham palace .
'a very great <name> ! '
said he .
'i have enjoyed her hospitality .
she represents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world .
the next is the one we are going to .
mrs. zigler uses 'em , and they break her up every week on returned empties . '
'oh , you mean the stores ? '
i said .
<unk> .
zigler means it more .
they are quite <unk> in their outlook .
i guess i 'll wait outside and pray while you wrestle with 'em . '
my business at the stores finished , and my bag <unk> from the hotel , his moving palace slid us into the country .
'i owe it to you , ' zigler began as smoothly as the car , 'to tell you what i am now .
i represent the business end of the american invasion .
not the blame cars themselves  i would n't be found dead in one  but the tools that make 'em .
i am the zigler <unk> tool and <unk> trust .
the trust , sir , is entirely my own  in my own inventions .
i am the <unk> <unk> <unk>  the lightest <unk> on the market  one price , one power , one guarantee .
i am the <unk> <unk> , <unk> company for <unk> bodies ; and i am the rush <unk> for military <unk>  absolutely silent  which the continent <unk> under royalty .
with three exceptions , the british are n't wise to it yet .
that 's all i represent at present .
you saw me take off my hat to your late <name> ?
i owe every cent i have to that great an ' good <name> .
yes , sir , i came out of africa , after my eighteen months ' <unk> and <unk> treatment and <unk> , as her prisoner of war , like a giant refreshed .
there was n't anything could hold me , when i 'd got my hooks into it , after that experience .
and to you as a representative british citizen , i say here and now that i regard you as the founder of the family fortune  <name> 's and mine . '
'but i only gave you some papers and tobacco . '
'what more does any citizen need ?
the <unk> <name> would n't have helped me as much then ; an '  talking about south africa , tell me  ' we talked about south africa till the car stopped at the georgian lodge of a great park .
'we 'll get out here .
i want to show you a rather <unk> view , ' said zigler .
we walked , perhaps , half a mile , across <unk> turf , past a lake , entered a dark <unk> wood , ticking with the noise of pheasants ' feet , and came out suddenly , where five rides met , at a small classic <name> between <unk> <unk> statues which faced a circle of turf , several acres in extent .
<name> <unk> , of a size that i had never seen before , walled the <unk> circle like cliffs of riven obsidian , except at the lower end , where it gave on to a stretch of undulating bare ground ending in a <unk> slope <unk> away .
'that 's where the old <unk> <unk> used to be , ' said zigler .
'that <unk> is called <name> 's <name> .
<name> <unk> and mrs. siddons an ' <unk> an ' all that crowd used to act plays here for king <name> the third .
was n't it ?
well , <name> is the only king i play .
let it go at that .
this circle was the stage , i guess .
the kings an ' the nobility sat in <name> 's <name> .
i forget who <unk> these statues at the door .
they 're the comic and tragic muse .
but it 's a <unk> view , ai n't it ? '
the sunlight was leaving the park .
i caught a glint of silver to the southward beyond the wooded ridge .
'that 's the ocean  the channel , i mean , ' said zigler .
'it 's twenty-three miles as a man flies .
a <unk> view , ai n't it ? '
i looked at the severe <unk> , the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues , at the blue-green shadows on the <unk> grass , and at the still bright plain in front where some deer were feeding .
'it 's a most dramatic contrast , but i think it would be better on a summer 's day , ' i said , and we went on , up one of the noiseless rides , a quarter of a mile at least , till we came to the <unk> front of an enormous georgian pile .
four footmen revealed themselves in a hall <name> with pictures .
'i hired this off of my lord <unk> , ' zigler explained , while they helped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of <unk> and <unk> ancestors .
<unk> .
they always look at me too , as if i'd blown in from the gutter .
which , of course , i have .
that 's <name> , <name> <unk> .
old man <name> painted her .
do you see any likeness to my lord <unk> ?
why , have n't you ever met up with him ?
he was captain mankeltow  my <name> british artillery captain that blew up my gun in the war , an ' then tried to bury me against my religious principles [ 4 ] .
<unk> .
his father died and he got the lordship .
that was about all he got by the time that your british <unk> were through with him .
so he said i 'd oblige him by hiring his ranch .
it 's a hell an ' a half of a proposition to handle , but <name>  mrs. <unk>  understands it .
come right in to the parlour and be very welcome . '
[ footnote 4 : " the captive " : <unk> and discoveries . ]
he guided me , hand on shoulder , into a babble of high-pitched talk and laughter that filled a vast drawing-room .
he introduced me as the founder of the family fortunes to a little , lithe , <unk> woman whose speech and greeting were of the <unk> south .
she in turn presented me to her mother , a <unk> <unk> old <name> with a cap of priceless venetian point , hands that must have held many hearts in their time , and a dignity as unquestioned and <unk> as an empress .
she was , indeed , a <name> of <name> , who , on their own ground , <unk> the <unk> of <name> .
the rest of the company came from buffalo , cincinnati , <name> and chicago , with here and there a softening southern strain .
a party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece surmounted by a <unk> .
two portly men , half hidden by a cased harp , discussed , over sheaves of typewritten documents , the terms of some contract .
a knot of matrons talked servants  <name> <unk> <name>  across the grand piano .
a youth ravaged an old bookcase , while beside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves , dead three hundred years , but now leaping to life and warning under the shaded <unk> .
in a corner half-a-dozen girls examined the glazed tables that held the decorations  english and foreign  of the late lord <unk> .
'see heah !
would this be the <unk> of the <unk> ? '
one said , pointing .
'i <unk> likely .
no !
the garter has " <name> swore "  i know that much .
this is " <unk> <unk> " something . '
'oh , what 's that cunning little copper cross with " for <unk> " ? '
a third cried .
'say !
look at here ! '
said the young man at the bookcase .
'here 's a first edition of <unk> cross and a <unk> 's birds right next to it  just like so many best sellers .
look , <unk> ! '
the girl beneath the picture half turned her body but not her eyes .
'you do n't tell me ! '
she said slowly .
<unk> women amounted to something after all . '
'but woman 's scope , and outlook was <unk> <unk> in those days , ' one of the matrons put in , from the piano .
<unk> ?
for her ?
if they <unk> , i guess she was the <unk> .
who was she ?
peters , <unk> 's the <unk> ? '
a thin butler , in charge of two footmen removing the <unk> , slid to a table and handed her a <unk> book .
he was <unk> by one of the men behind the harp , who wished to get a telephone call through to edinburgh .
'the local office shuts at six , ' said peters .
'but i can get through to '  he named some town  'in ten minutes , sir . '
'that suits me .
you 'll find me here when you 've hitched up .
oh , say , peters !
we  mister <unk> an ' me  ai n't goin ' by that early morning train to-morrow  but the other one  on the other line  whatever they call it . '
'the nine twenty-seven , sir .
yes , sir .
early breakfast <name> be at half-past eight and the car <name> be at the door at nine . '
<unk> ! '
an imperious young voice called .
'what 's the <unk> with lord <unk> 's <unk> of the <unk> ?
we <unk> n't find it <unk> . '
'well , miss , i have heard that that order is usually returned to his majesty on the death of the holder .
yes , miss . '
then in a whisper to a footman , 'more butter for the <unk> in king <name> 's corner . '
he stopped behind my chair .
'your room is number eleven , sir .
may i trouble you for your keys ? '
he left the room with a <unk> maiden called <name> who had announced she would not go to bed <unk> <name> , <name> , <unk> takes me  so there ! '
he very kindly looked in on me for a moment as i was dressing for dinner .
'not at all , sir , ' he replied to some compliment i paid him .
'i <unk> the late lord <unk> for fifteen years .
he was very abrupt in his movements , sir .
as a rule i never received more than an <unk> notice of a journey .
we used to go to syria frequently .
i have been twice to babylon .
mr. and mrs. zigler 's requirements are , comparatively speaking , few . '
'but the guests ? '
'very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their <unk> .
extremely simple , if i may say so , sir . '
i had the privilege of taking mrs. <name> in to dinner , and was rewarded with an entirely new , and to me rather shocking view , of <name> <name> , who , she said , had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and fire , and had surrendered the remnant to aliens .
'my brother , suh , ' she said , <unk> at <unk> in order that <unk> should <unk> new england to-day .
if i took any interest in any <unk> outside of my son-in-law <unk> <unk> , i should say that my brother 's death had been amply avenged . '
the man at her right took up the challenge , and the war spread .
her eyes twinkled over the flames she had lit .
'do n't these folk , ' she said a little later , <unk> you of arabs <unk> under the pyramids ? '
'i 've never seen the pyramids , ' i replied .
<unk> !
i did n't know you were as english as all that . '
and when i laughed , 'are you ? '
<unk> .
it saves trouble . '
'now that 's just what i find so significant among the english '  this was <name> 's mother , i think , with one elbow well forward among the salted almonds .
'oh , i know how you feel , madam <name> , but a <unk> like myself  i 'm buffalo  even though we come over every year  notices the <name> for comfort in england .
there 's so little conflict or uplift in british society . '
'but we like being comfortable , ' i said .
'i know it .
it 's very characteristic .
but ai n't it a little , just a little , lacking in <unk> an ' imagination ? '
'they have n't any need for <unk> , ' madam <name> struck in .
'they have n't any <name> island standards to live up to . '
'but we can <unk> , ' the buffalo woman charged on .
'now you have done it ! '
i whispered to the old <name> as the blessed word <unk> ' woke up all the old arguments for and against .
there was not a dull moment in that dinner for me  nor afterwards when the boys and girls at the piano played the <unk> tunes of their own land , while their elders , <unk> interested , <unk> into the discussion of that land 's future , till there was talk of <unk> .
when all the company had been set to tables zigler led me into his <unk> study , where i noticed he kept his <unk> , and spoke simply as a child , gravely as a bishop , of the years that were past since our last meeting .
'that 's about all , i guess  up to date , ' he said when he had unrolled the bright map of his fortunes across three continents .
<unk> ' <name> suits me .
so does your country , sir .
my own country ?
you heard what that detroit man said at dinner .
" a government of the alien , by the alien , for the alien . "
mother 's right , too .
<name> killed us .
from the highest motives  but he killed us .
oh , say , that reminds me .
<unk> kill a man from the highest motives ? '
'not from any motive  as far as i remember . '
'well , i have .
it do n't weigh on my mind any , but it was interesting .
life is interesting for a <name>  for any  man in england .
<unk> !
life in england is like settin ' in the front row at the theatre and never knowin ' when the whole blame drama wo n't spill itself into your lap .
i did n't always know that .
i lie abed now , and i blush to think of some of the breaks i made in south africa .
about the british .
not your official method of doin ' business .
but the spirit .
i was 'way , 'way off on the spirit .
are you acquainted with any other country where you 'd have to kill a man or two to get at the national spirit ? '
'well , ' i answered , 'next to marrying one of its women , killing one of its men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country .
i take it you killed a british citizen . '
'why , no .
our syndicate confined its operations to aliens  <unk> aliens ... . <unk> know an english lord called lundie [ 5 ] ?
looks like a <unk> and soap advertisement .
i imagine he was in your supreme court before he came into his lordship . '
[ footnote 5 : 'the <unk> ' : actions and reactions . ]
'he is a lawyer  what we call a law lord  a judge of appeal  not a real hereditary lord . '
'that 's as much beyond me as this ! '
zigler slapped a fat <unk> on the table .
'but i <unk> this unreal law lord lundie is kind o ' real in his decisions ?
i judged so .
and  one more question .
<unk> meet a man called walen ? '
'd'you mean <unk> , the editor of  ? '
i mentioned the journal .
'that 's him .
<unk> like a tough , talks like a maxim , and trains with kings . '
'he does , ' i said .
<unk> knows all the crowned heads of europe intimately .
it 's his hobby . '
'well , there 's the whole outfit for you  <unk> ' my lord <unk> , <unk> mankeltow , an ' me .
all active murderers  specially the law lord  or accessories after the fact .
and what do they hand you out for that , in this country ? '
<unk> years , i believe , ' was my reply .
he reflected a moment .
<unk> , ' he said , and followed it with a <unk> .
<unk> months at the cape is my limit .
say , murder ai n't the <unk> ' event those <unk> in the magazines make out .
it develops naturally like any other proposition ... . say , <unk> play this golf game ?
it 's come up in the states from maine to california , an ' we 're <unk> ' all the champions in sight .
not a business man 's play , but interestin ' .
i 've got a <unk> in the park here that they tell me is the finest inland course ever .
i had to pay extra for that when i hired the <unk>  last year .
it was just before i signed the papers that our murder <unk> .
my lord <unk> he asked me down for the week-end to fix up something or other  about peters and the linen , i think 't was .
mrs. zigler took a holt of the proposition .
she understood peters from the word " go . "
there was n't any <unk> ; only fifteen or twenty folk .
a full house is thirty-two , <name> tells me .
'guess we must be near on that to-night .
in the smoking-room here , my lord <unk>  mankeltow that was  introduces me to this walen man with the nose .
he 'd been in the war too , from start to finish .
he knew all the columns and generals that i'd <unk> with in the days of my zigler gun .
we kinder fell into each other 's arms an ' let the harsh world go by for a while .
<unk> he introduces me to your lord lundie .
he was a new proposition to me .
if he had n't been a lawyer he 'd have made a lovely <unk> .
i thought i had played poker some .
another of my breaks .
<unk> !
it cost me eleven hundred dollars besides what <name> said when i retired .
i have no fault to find with your hereditary aristocracy , or your judiciary , or your press .
<unk> we all went to church across the park here ... . <unk> !
think o' your <unk> ' my religion !
i 've become an <unk> since i married .
<unk> ... . after lunch walen did his <unk> stunt in the <unk> here .
he was long on kings .
and continental crises .
i do not pretend to follow british domestic politics , but in the <unk> business a man has to know something of international possibilities .
at present , you british are settin ' in <unk> on dynamite <unk> .
walen 's talk put me wise on the location and size of some of the <unk> .
<unk> !
'after that , we four went out to look at those <unk> i was <unk> ' .
we each took a club .
mine '  he glanced at a great tan bag by the fire-place  'was the beginner 's friend  the <unk> .
well , sir , this golf proposition took a holt of me as quick as  quick as death .
they had to <unk> me off the greens when it got too dark to see , and then we went back to the house .
i was walkin ' ahead with my lord <unk> <unk> beginners ' golf .
( i was the man who ought to have been killed by rights . )
we cut 'cross lots through the woods to <name> 's <name>  that place i showed you this afternoon .
lundie and walen were , maybe , twenty or thirty <name> behind us in the dark .
<unk> and i stopped at the theatre to admire at the ancestral <unk> .
he took me right under the biggest  king somebody 's yew  and while i was <unk> ' it with my handkerchief , he says , " look heah ! "
just as if it was a rabbit  and down comes a <unk> into the theatre with no more noise than the dead .
my rush <unk> is the only one on the market that allows that sort of <unk> work ... . what ?
a <unk>  with two men in it .
both men jump out and start <unk> ' with the engines .
i was starting to tell mankeltow  i ca n't remember to call him <unk> any more  that it looked as if the <name> british flying corps had got on to my rush <unk> at last ; but he steps out from under the yew to these two stealthy <unk> and says , " what 's the trouble ?
can i be of any service ? "
he thought  so did i  't was some of the boys from <unk> or salisbury .
well , sir , from there on , the situation developed like a <unk> in hell .
the man on the nigh side of the machine whirls round , pulls his gun and fires into mankeltow 's face .
i laid him out with my <unk> automatically .
any one who shoots a friend of mine gets what 's comin ' to him if i 'm within reach .
he drops .
mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief .
the man the far side of the machine starts to run .
lundie down the ride , or it might have been walen , shouts , " what 's happened ? "
mankeltow says , " collar that chap . "
'the second man runs <unk> round the machine , one hand <unk> ' behind him .
mankeltow heads him off to me .
he breaks blind for walen and lundie , who are runnin ' up the ride .
there 's some sort of mix-up among 'em , which it 's too dark to see , and a thud .
walen says , " oh , well collared ! "
lundie says , " that 's the only thing i never learned at harrow ! " ...
mankeltow runs up to 'em , still <unk> ' his neck , and says , " he did n't fire at me .
it was the other chap .
where is he ? "
' " i 've stretched him alongside his machine , " i says .
' " are they <unk> ? "
says lundie .
' " no .
<unk> .
i ca n't make it out , " says mankeltow .
' " look at here , " says walen , kind of <unk> .
" this man ai n't <unk> at all .
did n't you hear somethin ' crack when he lit , lundie ? "
' " my god ! "
says lundie .
" did i ?
i thought it was my suspenders "  no , he said " braces . "
<unk> there i left them and sort o ' tiptoed back to my man , <unk> ' he'd revived and quit .
but he had n't .
that darned <unk> had hit him on the back of the neck just where his helmet stopped .
he 'd got his .
i knew it by the way the head rolled in my hands .
then the others came up the ride <unk> ' their load .
no <unk> ' that shuffle on grass .
d'you remember it  in south africa ?
<unk> .
' " hsh ! "
says lundie .
" do you know i 've broken this man 's neck ? "
' " same here , " i says .
' " what ?
both ? "
says mankeltow .
' " nonsense ! "
says lord lundie .
" who 'd have thought he was that out of training ?
a man ought n't to fly if he ai n't fit . "
' " what did they want here , anyway ? "
said walen ; and mankeltow says , " we ca n't leave them in the open .
some one 'll come .
<name> 'em to <name> 's <name> . "
we <unk> 'em again and laid 'em out on a stone bench .
they were still dead in spite of our best attentions .
we knew it , but we went through the motions till it was quite dark .
'wonder if all murderers do that ?
" we want a light on this , " says walen after a spell .
" there ought to be one in the machine .
why did n't they light it ? "
'we came out of <name> 's <name> , and shut the doors behind us .
some stars were showing then  same as when cain did his little act , i guess .
i climbed up and searched the machine .
she was very well equipped , i found two electric torches in <unk> alongside her <unk> by the rear seat .
' " what make is she ? "
says mankeltow .
' " continental <unk> , " i says .
" my engines and my rush <unk> . "
<unk> whistles .
" here  let me look , " he says , and <unk> the other torch .
she was sure well equipped .
we gathered up an armful of cameras an ' maps an ' <unk> an ' an album of mounted photographs which we took to <name> 's <name> and spread on a marble-topped table ( i 'll show you to-morrow ) which the king of naples had presented to grandfather <unk> .
walen starts to go through 'em .
we wanted to know why our friends had been so prejudiced against our society .
' " wait a minute , " says lord lundie .
" lend me a handkerchief . "
'he pulls out his own , and walen <unk> his <unk> bandanna , and lundie covers their faces .
" now , " he says , " we 'll go into the evidence . "
'there was n't any flaw in that evidence .
walen read out their last observations , and mankeltow asked questions , and lord lundie sort o' <unk> , and i looked at the photos in the album .
<unk> see a <unk> <unk> of england for military purposes ?
it's interestin ' but indecent  like turnin ' a man upside down .
none of those <unk> <unk> of forts could have been taken without my rush <unk> .
' " i wish we was as thorough as they are , " says mankeltow , when walen stopped <unk> ' .
' " we 've been thorough enough , " says lord lundie .
" the evidence against both accused is conclusive .
any other country would give 'em seven years in a fortress .
we should probably give 'em eighteen months as first-class <unk> .
but their case , " he says , " is out of our hands .
we must review our own .
mr. zigler , " he said , " <name> you tell us what steps you took to bring about the death of the first accused ? "
i told him .
he wanted to know specially whether i 'd stretched first accused before or after he had fired at mankeltow .
mankeltow testified he 'd been shot at , and exhibited his neck as evidence .
it was scorched .
' " now , mr. walen , " says lord lundie .
" <name> you kindly tell us what steps you took with regard to the second accused ? "
' " the man ran directly at me , me lord , " says walen .
" i said , 'oh no , you do n't , ' and hit him in the face . "
<unk> lundie lifts one hand and <unk> second accused 's face .
there was a bruise on one cheek and the <name> was all <unk> with grass .
he was a <unk> man .
' " what happened after that ? "
says lord lundie .
' " to the best of my remembrance he turned from me towards your lordship . "
'then lundie goes ahead .
" i stooped , and caught the man round the ankles , " he says .
" the sudden check threw him partially over my left shoulder .
i jerked him off that shoulder , still holding his ankles , and he fell heavily on , it would appear , the point of his <name> , death being instantaneous . "
' " death being instantaneous , " says walen .
<unk> lundie takes off his gown and wig  you could see him do it  and becomes our <unk> .
" that 's our case , " he says .
" i know how i should direct the jury , but it 's an undignified business for a lord of appeal to lift his hand to , and some of my learned brothers , " he says , " might be disposed to be facetious . "
'i guess i ca n't be properly <unk> .
any one who steered me out of that trouble might have had the laugh on me for generations .
but i'm only a millionaire .
i said we 'd better search second accused in case he 'd been carryin ' concealed weapons .
' " that certainly is a point , " says lord lundie .
" but the question for the jury would be whether i exercised more force than was necessary to prevent him from usin ' them . "
i did n't say anything .
he was n't <unk> my language .
second accused had his gun on him sure enough , but it had jammed in his <unk> .
he was too fleshy to reach behind for business purposes , and he did n't look a <unk> anyway .
both of 'em carried <unk> of private letters .
by the time walen had translated , we knew how many children the fat one had at home and when the thin one reckoned to be married .
too bad !
<unk> .
<unk> walen to me while we was <unk> ' their jackets ( they was not in uniform ) : " ever read a book called the <unk> , mr .
zigler ? "
' " not that i recall at the present moment , " i says .
' " well , do , " he says .
" you 'd appreciate it .
you 'd appreciate it now , i assure you . "
' " i 'll remember , " i says .
" but i do n't see how this song and dance helps us any .
here 's our corpses , here 's their machine , and <unk> bound to come . "
' " heavens !
that reminds me , " says lundie .
" what time 's dinner ? "
' " half-past eight , " says mankeltow .
" it 's half-past five now .
we knocked off golf at twenty to , and if they had n't been such silly asses , <unk> pistols like civilians , we 'd have had them to dinner .
why , they might be sitting with us in the smoking-room this very minute , " he says .
then he said that no man had a right to take his profession so seriously as these two <unk> .
' " how interestin ' ! "
says lundie .
" i 've noticed this impatient attitude toward their victim in a good many murderers .
i never understood it before .
of course , it 's the disposal of the body that <unk> 'em .
now , i wonder , " he says , " who our case <name> come up before ?
let 's run through it again . "
'then walen whirls in .
he 'd been <unk> ' his nails in a corner .
we was all nerved up by now ... . me ?
the worst of the bunch .
i had to think for <name> as well .
' " we can't be tried , " says walen .
" we mustn't be tried !
it 'll make an infernal international stink .
what did i tell you in the smoking-room after lunch ?
the tension 's at <unk> already .
this 'ud snap it .
ca n't you see that ? "
' " i was thinking of the legal aspect of the case , " says lundie .
" with a good jury we 'd likely be acquitted . "
' " acquitted ! "
says walen .
" who 'd dare acquit us in the face of what 'ud be demanded by  the other party ?
did you ever hear of the war of jenkins ' ear ?
<unk> hear of <name> and <unk> ?
<unk> hear of an ultimatum ?
you know who these two idiots are ; you know who we are  a lord of appeal , a viscount of the english peerage , and me  me knowing all i know , which the men who know dam ' well know that i do know !
it's our necks or <unk> .
which do you think this government would choose ?
we can't be tried ! "
he says .
' " then i expect i 'll have to resign me club , " lundie goes on .
" i don't think that 's ever been done before by an <unk> member .
i must ask the secretary . "
i guess he was kinder <unk> for the minute , or maybe 'twas the lordship comin ' out on him .
' " rot ! "
says mankeltow .
" walen 's right .
we ca n't afford to be tried .
we 'll have to bury them ; but my <unk> locks up all the tools at five o'clock . "
' " not on your life ! "
says lundie .
he was on deck again  as the <unk> lawyer .
" right or wrong , if we attempt concealment of the bodies we 're done for . "
" 'i 'm glad of that , " says mankeltow , " because , after all , it ain't cricket to bury 'em . "
<unk>  but i know i ai n't english  that consideration did n't worry me as it ought .
an ' besides , i was thinkin '  i had to  an ' i 'd begun to see a light 'way off  a little <unk> ' light o ' salvation .
' " then what are we to do ? "
says walen .
" zigler , what do you advise ?
your neck 's in it too . "
' " gentlemen , " i says , " something lord lundie let fall a while back gives me an idea .
i move that this committee <unk> big claus and little claus , who have elected to commit suicide in our midst , to leave the premises as they came .
i 'm asking you to take big chances , " i says , " but they 're all we 've got , " and then i broke for the <unk> .
'do n't tell me the english ca n't think as quick as the next man when it 's up to them !
they lifted 'em out o ' <name> 's <name>  reverent , but not <unk> ' time  whilst i found out what had brought her down .
one cylinder was <unk> ' .
i did n't stop to fix it .
my <unk> <name> hold up on six .
we 've proved that .
if her crew had relied on my <unk> , they 'd have been half-way home by then , instead of takin ' their seats with hangin ' heads like they was ashamed .
they ought to have been ashamed too , playin ' <unk> in a british peer 's park !
i took big chances <unk> ' her without controls , but 't was a dead still night an' a clear run  you saw it  across the theatre into the park , and i prayed she 'd rise before she hit high timber .
i set her all i dared for a quick lift .
i told mankeltow that if i gave her too much nose she 'd be liable to <unk> and flop .
he did n't want another inquest on his estate .
no , sir !
so i had to fix her up in the dark .
<unk> !
'i took big chances , too , while those other three held on to her and i worked her up to full power .
my <unk> 's no <unk> to pull against .
but i climbed out just in time .
i 'd hitched the <unk> ' lamp to her tail so 's we could track her .
otherwise , with my rush <unk> , we might 's well have <unk> an owl out of a barn .
she left just that way when we let her go .
no sound except the propellers  <unk> !
<unk> !  there was a dip in the ground ahead .
it hid her lamp for a second  but there 's no such thing as time in real life .
then that lamp travelled up the far slope slow  too slow .
then it kinder lifted , we judged .
then it sure was <unk> ' .
then it lifted good .
d'you know why ?
our four naked <unk> ' souls was out there underneath her , <unk> ' her heavens high .
yes , sir .
we did it ! ...
and that lamp kept <unk> ' and <unk> ' .
then she <unk> !
my god , she <unk> twice , which was what i 'd been afraid of all along !
then she straightened up , and went away <unk> ' to <name> , for that blessed <name> of our <name> got smaller and smaller till we could n't track it any more .
then we breathed .
we had n't breathed any since their arrival , but we did n't know it till we breathed that time  all together .
then we dug our <unk> out of our palms an ' came alive again  in <unk> .
<unk> spoke first .
" we therefore commit their bodies to the air , " he says , an ' puts his cap on .
' " the deep  the deep , " says walen .
" it 's just twenty-three miles to the channel . "
' " poor chaps !
poor chaps ! "
says mankeltow .
" we 'd have had 'em to dinner if they had n't lost their heads .
i ca n't tell you how this distresses me , <unk> . "
' " well , look at here , <name> , " i says .
" it 's only god 's own <name> you an ' me ai n't lyin ' in <name> 's <name> now , and if that fat man had known enough to fetch his gun around while he was runnin ' , lord lundie and walen would have been alongside us . "
' " i see that , " he says .
" but we 're alive and they 're dead , do n't ye know . "
' " i know it , " i says .
" that 's where the dead are always so damned unfair on the survivors . "
' " i see that too , " he says .
" but i 'd have given a good deal if it hadn't happened , poor chaps ! "
' " amen ! "
says lundie .
then ?
oh , then we <unk> walked back two an ' two to <name> 's <name> an ' lit matches to see we had n't left anything behind .
walen , he had confiscated the <unk> before they left .
there was the first man 's pistol which we 'd forgot to return him , lyin ' on the stone bench .
mankeltow puts his hand on it  he never touched the trigger  an ' , bein ' an automatic , of course the blame thing <name> off  spiteful as a <unk> !
' " look out !
they 'll have one of us yet , " says walen in the dark .
but they did n't  the lord had n't quit being our shepherd  and we heard the bullet <unk> across the veldt  quite like old times .
<unk> !
' " swine ! "
says mankeltow .
'after that i did n't hear any more " poor chap " talk ... . me ?
i never worried about killing my man .
i was too busy <unk> ' how a british jury might regard the proposition .
i guess lundie felt that way too .
'oh , but say !
we had an interestin ' time at dinner .
folks was expected whose auto had <name> up on the road .
they had n't wired , and peters had laid two extra places .
we noticed 'em as soon as we sat down .
i 'd hate to say how noticeable they were .
mankeltow with his neck bandaged ( he'd caught a relaxed throat <unk> ' ) sent for peters and told him to take those empty places away  if you please .
it takes something to rattle peters .
he was rattled that time .
nobody else noticed anything .
and now ... ' 'where did they come down ? '
i asked , as he rose .
'in the channel , i guess .
there was nothing in the papers about 'em .
shall we go into the <unk> , and see what these boys and girls are doin ? '
but say , ai n't life in england <unk> ' ?
rebirth if any god should say " i <name> restore the world her yesterday whole as before my judgment blasted it "  who would not lift heart , eye , and hand in passion o'er the gift ?
if any god should <name> to wipe from mind the memory of this ill which is mankind in soul and substance now  who would not bless even to tears his <unk> ?
if any god should give us leave to fly these present deaths we live , and safely die in those lost lives we lived ere we were born  what man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn ?
for we are what we are  so broke to blood and the strict works of war  so long subdued to sacrifice , that threadbare death commands hardly observance at our <unk> hands .
yet we were what we were , and , fashioned so , it pleases us to stare at the far show of unbelievable years and shapes that flit , in our own likeness , on the edge of it .
the horse marines ( <unk> ) the <unk> .
hon .
<unk> .
<unk> , secretary of state for war [ 6 ] , was questioned in the house of commons on <name> 8th about the <unk> which the war office is using for the purpose of teaching recruits to ride .
lord <unk> asked the war secretary if <unk> were to be supplied to all the cavalry regiments for teaching recruits to ride .
'the <name> lord , ' replied mr. <unk> , 'is doubtless alluding to certain dummy horses on <unk> which have been tested with very satisfactory results . ' ...
the mechanical steed is a wooden horse with an astonishing tail .
it is painted brown and mounted on swinging rails .
the recruit leaps into the saddle and pulls at the reins while the <unk> rocks the animal to and fro with his foot .
the <unk> are being made at <unk> .
they are quite cheap .
 daily paper .
[ footnote 6 : now viscount <unk> of <unk> . ]
my instructions to mr. leggatt , my engineer , had been accurately obeyed .
he was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul , from coventry via london , to southampton docks to await my arrival ; and very pretty she looked , under the steamer 's side among the railway lines , at six in the morning .
next to her new paint and varnish i was most impressed by her four brand-new <unk> .
'but i did n't order new <unk> , ' i said as we moved away .
'these are <unk> , too . '
<unk> , ' said leggatt .
<unk> <unk> . '
'then there has been a mistake . '
'oh no , sir ; they 're gratis . '
the number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of <unk> <unk> <unk> is so limited that i believe i asked leggatt for an explanation .
'i do n't know that i could very well explain , sir , ' was the answer .
'it 'ud come better from mr. pyecroft .
he 's on leaf at portsmouth  staying with his uncle .
his uncle 'ad the body all night .
i 'd defy you to find a scratch on her even with a microscope . '
'then we <name> go home by the portsmouth road , ' i said .
and we went at those speeds which are allowed before the <unk> begins or the police are thawed out .
we were blocked near portsmouth by a battalion of regulars on the move .
<unk> manoeuvres just ending , ' said leggatt .
'they 've had a fortnight in the downs . '
he said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind portsmouth town railway station , where he slowed at a <unk> shop .
the door was open , and a small old man sat on three <unk> swinging his feet over a stooping blue back .
'you call that <unk> ' 'em ? '
he piped .
'can you see your face in 'em yet ?
no !
then shine 'em , or i 'll give you a <unk> ' you 'll remember ! '
'if you stop <unk> ' me in the mouth perhaps i 'd do better , ' said pyecroft 's voice meekly .
we blew the horn .
pyecroft arose , put away the brushes , and received us not otherwise than as a king in his own country .
'are you going to leave me up here all day ? '
said the old man .
pyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room .
'it 's his <unk> , ' pyecroft explained .
'you ca n't shine <unk> feet  and he has n't had his breakfast . '
'i have n't had mine either , ' i said .
<unk> for two more , uncle , ' pyecroft sang out .
'go out an ' buy it then , ' was the answer , 'or else it 's <unk> . '
pyecroft turned to leggatt , gave him his <unk> orders , and despatched him with the coppers .
'i have got four new <unk> on my car , ' i began impressively .
'yes , ' said mr. pyecroft .
'you have , and i <name> say '  he patted my car 's bonnet  'you earned 'em . '
'i want to know why  , ' i went on .
<unk> justifiable .
you have n't noticed anything in the papers , have you ? '
'i 've only just landed .
i have n't seen a paper for weeks . '
'then you can lend me a virgin ear .
there 's been a scandal in the <name> service  the army , i believe they call 'em . '
a bag of <unk> pitched on the counter .
<unk> that , ' said the uncle from within .
pyecroft rigged a small <unk> , while i took down the shutters , and sold a young <name> in <unk> two bunches of mixed greens and one soft orange .
<unk> stuff to handle on an empty stomach , ai n't it ? '
said pyecroft .
'what about my new <unk> ? '
i insisted .
'oh , any amount .
but the question is '  he looked at me steadily  'is this what you might call a court-martial or a <unk> inquiry ? '
<unk> a <unk> , ' said i .
'that being so , ' said pyecroft , 'we can rapidly arrive at facts .
last thursday  the shutters go behind those baskets  last thursday at five bells in the forenoon watch , otherwise <unk> a.m. , your mr. leggatt was discovered on westminster bridge laying his course for the old <name> road . '
'but that does n't lead to southampton , ' i interrupted .
'then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses .
be that as it may , we found him in that latitude , simultaneous as <name> and me was <unk> route for waterloo to rejoin our respective ships  or navies i should say .
<name> was a <unk> , which meant being on leaf , same as me , from a french <unk> at portsmouth .
a party of her trusty and well-beloved petty officers 'ad been seeing london , <unk> by the <unk> .
chaplain .
<name> 'ad detached himself from the squadron and was <unk> ' on his own when i joined him , in company of copious <unk> .
but , <name> you , your mr. leggatt <name> the line at the girls .
loud and long he <name> it . '
'i 'm glad of that , ' i said .
'you may be .
he adopted the <unk> formation from the first .
" yes , " he said , when we was <unk> him at  but you would n't know the pub  " i am going to southampton , " he says , " and i 'll stretch a point to go via portsmouth ; but , " says he , " seeing what sort of one hell of a time invariably <unk> when we cruise together , mr. pyecroft , i do not feel myself justified towards my generous and long-suffering employer in takin ' on that kind of ballast as well . "
i assure you he considered your interests . '
'and the girls ? '
i asked .
'oh , i left that to <name> .
i 'm a <unk> by nature .
so we embarked strictly <unk> <unk> .
but i should tell you , in case he did n't , that your mr. leggatt 's care for your interests 'ad extended to <unk> the car in matting and <unk> to preserve her <unk> .
she was all <unk> up like an <unk> baby . '
'he is careful about his <unk> , ' i said .
'for a man with no service experience i should say he was fair <unk> on the subject .
if we 'd been marines he could n't have been more pointed in his allusions to our <unk> socks .
however , we reduced him to a <unk> condition , and embarked for portsmouth .
i 'd seldom rejoined my <unk> <unk> automobile , avec a fur coat and goggles .
nor 'ad <name> . '
'did <name> say much ? '
i asked , helplessly turning the handle of the <unk> .
'that 's where i pitied the pore beggar .
he 'ad n't the language , so to speak .
he was confined to <unk> and <unk> 's and copious <unk> jews !
the french are very badly fitted with <unk> .
and then our mr. leggatt drove .
he drove . '
'was he in a very <unk> condition ? '
'not him !
we recognised the value of his cargo from the outset .
he had n't a chance to get more than moist at the edges .
after which we went to sleep ; and now we 'll go to breakfast . '
we entered the back room where everything was in order , and a screeching canary made us welcome .
the uncle had added sausages and piles of buttered toast to the <unk> .
the coffee , cleared with a piece of <unk> , was a revelation .
leggatt , who seemed to know the premises , had run the car into the <name> <unk> where her <unk> back almost blocked up the windows .
he minded shop while we ate .
pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap in the door .
the uncle ordered him in , after breakfast , to wash up , and he jumped in his gaiters at the old man 's commands as he has never jumped to mine .
'to <unk> the <unk> , ' said pyecroft , lighting his pipe .
'my slumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve , and by vile language from your mr .
leggatt . '
'i  i  ' leggatt began , a <unk> duster in one hand and a cup in the other .
'when you 're wanted aft you 'll be sent for , mr. leggatt , ' said pyecroft <unk> .
'it 's clean mess decks for you now .
<unk> once more , we was on a lonely and desolate ocean near <unk> , surrounded by gorse bushes , and a boy scout was stirring my stomach with his little <unk> . '
' " you count ten , " he says .
' " very good , boy jones , " i says , " count 'em , " and i hauled him in over the gunnel , and ten i gave him with my large flat hand .
the remarks he passed , lying face down tryin ' to bite my leg , would have reflected credit on any service .
having finished i dropped him overboard again , which was my gross political error .
i ought to 'ave killed him ; because he began <unk>  rapid and accurate  in a <unk> direction .
few equatorial <unk> are to be apprehended when <unk> .
's little pets take to <unk> ' .
make a note o ' that !
three minutes later we were stopped and boarded by scouts  up our backs , down our necks , and in our boots !
the last i heard from your mr. leggatt as he went under , <unk> ' 'em off his cap , was thanking heaven he 'd covered up the new <unk> with mats .
an <unk> soul ! '
'not a scratch on her body , ' said leggatt , pouring out the <unk> .
'and <name> ? '
said i .
'oh , <name> thought the much advertised social revolution had begun , but his mackintosh hampered him .
'you told me to bring the mackintosh , ' leggatt whispered to me .
'and when i 'ad 'em half convinced he was a french vicomte coming down to visit the commander-in-chief at portsmouth , he tried to take it off .
seeing his uniform underneath , some sucking sherlock holmes of the pink eye patrol ( they called him <name> ) deduced that i was n't speaking the truth .
<name> said i was tryin ' to sneak into portsmouth unobserved  unobserved <name> you !  and join hands with the enemy .
it <unk> that the scouts was conducting a <unk> against <unk> forces , ably assisted by all branches of the service , and they was so afraid the car would n't count ten points to them in the fray , that they 'd have scalped us , but for the intervention of an umpire  also in short <unk> .
a fleshy sight ! '
here mr. pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded .
'that umpire , ' he said suddenly , 'was our mr. morshed  a gentleman whose acquaintance you have already made and profited by , if i mistake not [ 7 ] . '
[ footnote 7 : <unk> lawful occasions , ' <unk> and discoveries . ]
'oh , was the navy in it too ? '
i said ; for i had read of wild doings occasionally among the boy scouts on the portsmouth road , in which navy , army , and the world at large seemed to have taken part .
'the navy was in it .
i was the only one out of it  for several seconds .
our mr. morshed failed to recognise me in my fur <unk> , and my <unk> ' winks at 'im behind your goggles did n't arrive .
but when <name> darling had told his story , i saluted , which is difficult in furs , and i stated i was bringin ' him dispatches from the north .
my mr. morshed <unk> on the instant .
i 've never known his <unk> <unk> out of order yet .
" go and guard your blessed road , " he says to the <unk> orphan asylum standing at attention all round him , and , when they was removed  " pyecroft , " he says , still <unk> voce , " what in hong-kong are you doing with this dun-coloured <unk> ? "
'it was your mr. leggatt 's <unk> matting which caught his eye .
she did resemble a <unk> , especially about the <unk> .
at these remarks i naturally threw myself on 'is bosom , so far as service conditions permitted , and revealed him all , mentioning that the car was yours .
you know his way of working his lips like a rabbit ?
yes , he was quite pleased .
" his car ! "
he kept murmuring , working his lips like a rabbit .
" i owe 'im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me .
i'll keep the car . "
'your mr. leggatt now injected some <unk> remarks to the effect that he was your chauffeur in charge of your car , and , as such , capable of so acting .
mr. morshed threw him a <unk> .
it sufficed .
did n't it suffice , mr .
leggatt ? '
'i knew if something did n't happen , something worse would , ' said leggatt .
'it never fails when you 're aboard . '
'and <name> ? '
i demanded .
<unk> was , so to speak , <unk> in a <unk> flat through his unfortunate lack of language .
i had to introduce him as part of the <unk> <unk> , and he was put under arrest , too .
then we sat on the grass and smoked , while <name> and co. violently annoyed the traffic on the portsmouth road , till the umpires , all in short <unk> , conferred on the valuable lessons of the <unk> and added up points , same as at <unk> .
i did n't hear their conclusions , but our mr. morshed delivered a farewell address to <name> and co. , tellin ' 'em they ought to have deduced from a hundred signs about me , that i was a friendly bringin ' in dispatches from the north .
we left 'em tryin ' to find those signs in the scout book , and we reached mr. morshed 's hotel at portsmouth at <unk> p.m. <unk> automobile .
here <unk> the first chapter . '
<unk> the second , ' i said .
the uncle and leggatt had finished washing up and were seated , smoking , while the damp duster dried at the fire .
<unk> what time was it , ' said pyecroft to leggatt , 'when our mr. morshed began to talk about uncles ? '
'when he came back to the bar , after he 'd changed into those <unk> clothes , ' said leggatt .
'that 's right .
" pye , " said he , " have you an uncle ? "
" i have , " i says .
" here 's <unk> to him , " and i finished my <name> and <unk> to you , uncle . '
'that 's right , ' said pyecroft 's uncle sternly .
'if you had n't i 'd have belted you worth <unk> ' , <name> .
i had the body all night . '
pyecroft smiled affectionately .
'so you 'ad , uncle , an ' beautifully you looked after her .
but as i was saying , " i have an uncle , too , " says mr. morshed , dark and lowering .
" yet somehow i ca n't love him .
i want to <unk> the beggar .
volunteers to <unk> my uncle , one pace to the front . "
'i took <name> with me the regulation distance .
<name> was getting interested .
your mr. leggatt preserved a strictly <unk> attitude .
' " you 're a pressed man , " says our mr. morshed .
" i owe your late employer much , so to say .
the car <name> manoeuvre all night , as requisite . "
'mr .
leggatt come out <name> as your employee , and , by <unk> 's divine <name> , instead of arguing , he pleaded his new paint and varnish which was mr. morshed 's one vital spot ( he 's lootenant on one of the new <unk> 's now ) .
" true , " says he , " paint 's an <unk> thing .
i'll give you one hour to arrange a modus <unk> .
full bunkers and steam ready by 9 p.m. to-night , if you please . "
'even so , mr. leggatt was far from content .
i 'ad to arrange the details .
we run her into the yard here . '
pyecroft nodded through the window at my car 's glossy <unk> .
'we took off the body with its mats and put it in the stable , <unk> ( and that yard 's a tight fit for extensive repairs ) the body of uncle 's blue delivery cart .
it overhung a trifle , but after i 'd lashed it i knew it would n't fetch loose .
thus , in our composite cruiser , we repaired once more to the hotel , and was immediately dispatched to the <unk> in the high street where we took aboard one <unk> which was waiting for us . '
<unk> aboard what ? '
i cried .
'one <unk> <unk> <unk> , with pure green <unk> and <unk> tail , pair <unk> glass eyes , complete set <unk> grinnin ' teeth , and two <unk> nostrils which , protruding from the brown papers , produced the tout <unk> of a <unk> sacrifice in the <unk> campaign .
do i make myself comprehensible ? '
<unk> .
did you say anything ? '
i asked .
'only to <name> .
to him , i says , wishing to try him .
" <unk> à <unk> <unk> .
je say mon <unk> .
eel <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
to me , says he , " vous <unk> ate <unk> !
<unk> de la vee ! "
and i saw by his eye he'd taken on for the full term of the war .
<name> was a blue-eyed , <unk> beggar of a useful make and <unk> ' habits .
your mr. leggatt he only groaned . '
leggatt nodded .
'it was like <unk> , ' he said .
'it was like <unk> . '
'once more , then , ' pyecroft swept on , 'we returned to the hotel and partook of a sumptuous repast , under the able and genial <unk> of our mr. morshed , who laid his <unk> unreservedly before us .
" in the first place , " he says , opening out <unk> , " my uncle , who , i regret to say , is a <unk> , has sold his alleged soul to dicky <unk> for a feathery hat and a pair o ' gilt spurs .
<name> , <unk> <unk> ! "
so <name> , you 'll be glad to hear  ' 'one minute , pye , ' i said .
'who is dicky <unk> ? '
'i do n't usually mingle myself up with the <unk> of the <name> service , but it <unk> that he was secretary o ' state for civil war , an ' he 'd been issuing mechanical <unk> <unk> which doctors recommend for <unk>  to the british cavalry in loo of real meat horses , to learn to ride on .
do n't you remember there was quite a stir in the papers owing to the cavalry not <unk> ' 'em ?
but that 's a minor item .
the main point was that our uncle , in his capacity of <unk> , <name> you , had wrote to the papers highly <unk> ' o' dicky <unk> 's mechanical substitutes an 'ad thus obtained promotion  all same as a <unk> stoker <unk> ' <unk> up the service under a pious captain .
at that point of the narrative we caught a phosphorescent glimmer why the <unk> might have been issued ; but none the less the navigation was intricate .
omitting the fact it was dark and cloudy , our <unk> lay somewhere in the south downs with his brigade , which was <unk> ' at <unk> manoeuvres on a large scale  red army <unk> blue , et <unk> ; an ' all we 'ad to go by was those flapping <unk> and your mr. leggatt 's groans . '
'i was thinking what the downs mean after dark , ' said leggatt angrily .
'they was worth thinkin ' of , ' said pyecroft .
'when we had studied the map till it fair spun , we decided to <name> forth and creep for uncle by hand in the dark , dark night , an ' present 'im with the <unk> .
so we embarked at <unk> <unk> 'one minute again , please .
how much did <name> understand by that time ? '
i asked .
<unk> unto the day  or night , perhaps i should say .
he told our mr. morshed he 'd follow him more sang <unk> , which is french for dead , drunk , or damned .
barrin ' 'is <unk> o ' language , there was n't a blemish on <name> .
but what i wished to imply was , when we climbed into the back parts of the car , our lootenant morshed says to me , " i doubt if i 'd <unk> my <unk> about too lavish , mr. pyecroft .
we ought to be sitting on five pounds ' worth of selected fireworks , and i think the rockets are your end . "
not being able to smoke with my 'ead over the side i threw it away ; and then your mr. leggatt , <unk> been as nearly mutinous as it pays to be with my mr. morshed , arched his back and drove . '
'where did he drive to , please ? '
said i .
<unk> , in search of any or either or both armies ; <unk> , of course , in search of our <unk> .
not finding him on the road , we ran about the grass looking for him .
this took us to a great many places in a short time .
ow <unk> that lilac did smell on top of that first down  <unk> ' its <unk> ' little heart out ! '
'i 'ad n't <unk> to notice , ' said mr. leggatt .
'the downs were full o' <unk> , and we 'd no lights . '
'we 'ad the <unk> to look at the map by .
did n't you notice the old <name> at the window where we saw the man in the <unk> ?
i thought <unk> as <unk> ' rig was <unk> , so to speak . '
'i tell you i 'ad n't <unk> to notice , ' leggatt repeated .
'that 's odd .
then what might 'ave made you tell the sentry at the first camp we found that you was the daily express <unk> ? '
'you ca n't touch pitch without being defiled , ' leggatt answered .
<unk> told the officer in the bath we were umpires ? '
'well , he asked us .
that was when we found the territorial battalion <unk> ' in slow time .
it lay on the left flank o ' the blue army , and it <unk> as it lay , too .
but it gave us our position as regards the respective armies .
we wandered a little more , and at <unk> p.m. , not having had a road under us for twenty minutes , we scaled the heights of something or other  which are about six hundred feet high .
here we <unk> to tighten the lashings of the <unk> , and we smelt leather and horses three counties deep all round .
we was , as you might say , in the thick of it . '
' " ah ! "
says my mr. morshed .
" my <unk> has indeed broadened .
what a little thing is an uncle , mr. pyecroft , in the presence o ' these <unk> ' constellations !
simply ludicrous ! "
he says , " to waste a <unk> on an individual .
we must <unk> it .
but we must get their <unk> up first .
touch off one rocket , if you please . "
'i touched off a green <unk> which rose several thousand metres , and burst into gorgeous stars .
" reproduce the manoeuvre , " he says , " at the other end o ' this ridge  if it do n't end in another <name> . "
so we steamed down the ridge a mile and a half east , and then i let <name> touch off a pink rocket , or he 'd <name> ' kissed me .
that was his only way to express his emotions , so to speak .
their heads come up then all around us to the extent o ' thousands .
we hears bugles like cocks crowing below , and on the top of it a most impressive sound which i 'd never enjoyed before because <unk> i 'd always been an <unk> part of it , so to say  the noise of 'ole armies gettin ' under arms .
they must 'ave anticipated a night attack , i imagine .
most impressive .
then we 'eard a <unk> .
" <unk> !
<unk> !
this is childish ! "
says lootenant morshed .
" we ca n't wait till they 've finished cutting chaff for their horses .
we must make 'em understand we 're not to be trifled with .
<unk> 'em with another rocket , mr .
pyecroft . "
' " it 's barely possible , sir , " i remarks , " that that 's a searchlight <unk> ' up , " and by the time we backed into a providential chalk cutting ( which was where our first tyre went <unk> ) she broke out to the northward , and began searching the ridge .
a smart bit o ' work . '
"twas n't a <unk> .
the inner tube had nipped because we <unk> so , ' leggatt interrupted .
<unk> your mr. leggatt was <unk> ' repairs , another searchlight broke out to the southward , and the two of 'em swept our ridge on both sides .
right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a hill , so to speak , crowned with what looked like a little fort .
morshed saw it before the beams shut off .
" that 's the key of the position ! "
he says .
" occupy it at all hazards . "
' " i have n't half got occupation for the next twenty minutes , " says your mr. leggatt , <unk> ' and <unk> ' in the dark .
<name> , now , 'ow morshed changed his tactics to suit 'is environment .
" right ! "
says he .
" i 'll stand by the ship .
mr. pyecroft and <name> , oblige me by doubling along the ridge to the east with all the <unk> and crackers you can <name> without spilling .
read the directions careful for the <unk> , mr. pyecroft , and touch them off at <unk> intervals .
<name> represents musketry an ' maxim fire under your command .
remember , it 's death or salisbury <unk> !
<unk> both ! "
'by these means and some moderately 'ard runnin ' , we distracted 'em to the eastward .
<unk> , you may not be aware , are same as bombs , with the <unk> left out .
in confined spots like <unk> , they knock a <unk> silly .
but you should read the directions <unk> .
in the intervals of the slow but <unk> fire of my <unk> , <name> , who had found a <unk> in the dark a little lower down , gave what you might call a <unk> reproduction o ' <unk> musketry .
they was large size crackers , and he concluded with the dull , <unk> thud o ' blind shells <unk> ' on soft ground . '
'how did he manage that ? '
i said .
'you throw a lighted <unk> into water and you 'll see , ' said pyecroft .
'thus , then , we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the surrounding landscapes fair <unk> and <unk> at us .
the <unk> or service might 'ave 'ad their doubts about the rockets but they could n't overlook our <unk> .
both sides tumbled out full of initiative .
i told <name> no two <unk> 'ad any right to be as happy as us , and we went back along the ridge to the derelict , and there was our mr. morshed <unk> ' his <unk> over fifty square mile o ' country with " attend , all ye who list to hear ! "
out of the fifth reader .
he 'd got as far as " and roused the shepherds o ' stonehenge , the rangers o ' <unk> " when we come up , and he <name> our attention to its truth as well as its beauty .
that 's rare in poetry , i 'm told .
he went right on to  " the red glare on <unk> roused those beggars at carlisle "  which he pointed out was poetic license for leith hill .
this allowed your mr. leggatt time to finish <unk> ' up his <unk> .
i 'eard the sweat 'op off his nose . '
'you know what it is , sir , ' said poor leggatt to me .
'it <unk> across my mind , as i listened to what was <unk> ' , that it might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up , but such considerations weighed not with our valiant leader .
' " mr. pyecroft , " he says , " it ca n't have escaped your notice that we 'ave one angry and <unk> intelligent army in front of us , an ' another <unk> angry and equally intelligent army in our rear .
what 'ud you recommend ? "
'most men would have besought 'im to do a lateral glide while there was yet time , but all i said was : " the <unk> is n't expended yet , sir . "
'he laid his hand on my shoulder .
" pye , " says he , " there 's worse men than you in loftier places .
they shall 'ave it .
none the less , " he remarks , " the ice is <unk> packing . "
'i may 'ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large armies , both deprived of their night 's sleep , was awake , as you might say , and <unk> ' into each other 's arms .
here <unk> the second chapter . '
he filled his pipe slowly .
the uncle had fallen asleep .
leggatt lit another cigarette .
'we then proceeded <unk> automobile along the ridge in a westerly direction towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed by the searchlight , but which on inspection ( your mr. leggatt bumped into an <unk> ' reef of it ) proved to be a <unk> ; <unk> , a <unk> pile of about three million <unk> , brought up there for the sheep , i suppose .
on all sides , excep ' the one we 'd come by , the ground fell away moderately quick , and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an ' full of harsh words of command .
' " i said it was the key to the position , " lootenant morshed remarks .
" trot out <unk> ! "
which we rightly took to read , " <unk> the <unk> . "
' " <unk> la ! "
says <name> in a <unk> tone , an ' <unk> <unk> on the flank .
' " silence ! "
says the lootenant .
" this is the <name> navy , not newmarket " ; and we carried <unk> to the top of the <unk> clump as directed .
<unk> to the inequalities of the <unk> ( i do think your mr. leggatt might have had a <unk> in his <name> ) he would n't rock free on the <unk> , and while <unk> ' him , his <unk> tail fetched adrift .
our lootenant was quick to seize the advantage .
' " remove that transformation , " he says .
" substitute one <name> candle .
<unk> is superior to <name> <unk> . "
'so we substituted .
he arranged the <unk> de <unk> in the shape of large drums  not saucers , <name> you  drums of coloured fire , with printed instructions , at proper distances round <unk> .
there was a brief <unk> while we dug ourselves in among the <unk> by hand .
then he touched off the fires , not omitting the <name> candle , and , you may take it from me , all was visible .
<unk> shone out in his naked splendour , red to port , green to starboard , and one white light at his bows , as per board o ' trade regulations .
only he did n't so much rock , you might say , as shrug himself , in a manner of speaking , every time the candle went off .
one ca n't have everything .
but the rest surpassed our highest expectations .
i think <unk> was noblest on the starboard or green side  more like when a man thinks he 's seeing mackerel in hell , do n't you know ?
and yet i 'd be the last to <unk> the effect of the port light on his teeth , or that <unk> look in his left eye .
he knew there was something going on he did n't approve of .
he looked worried . '
'did you laugh ? '
i said .
'i 'm not much of a wag myself ; nor it was n't as if we 'ad time to allow the spectacle to sink in .
the coloured fires was supposed to burn ten minutes , whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the <name> service would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half .
they <unk> our <unk> allusion as soon as it was across the <unk> , so to speak .
they were quite chafed at it .
of course , 'ad we reflected , we might have known that <unk> ' illuminated <unk> to an army that was learnin ' to ride on 'em partook of the nature of a double <unk> , as the french say  same as <unk> the tiller lines at a man who 's had a hanging in the family .
i knew the cox of the <unk> galley 'arf killed for a similar <unk> but we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive .
that was why we shifted .
we could <unk> tear our <unk> ' officer away .
he put his head on one side , and kept <unk> ' .
the only thing he 'ad neglected to provide was a line of retreat ; but your mr. leggatt  an <unk> soul in the last stage of wet prostration  here took command of the van , or , rather , the rear-guard .
we walked downhill beside him , holding on to the <unk> to prevent her <unk> .
these technical details , <unk> , are beyond me . '
he waved his pipe towards leggatt .
'i saw there was two <unk> ruts <unk> ' down <unk> somewhere , ' said leggatt .
'that was when the soldiers stopped laughin ' , and begun to run uphill . '
<unk> , <unk> , stroll ! '
pyecroft corrected .
'the dervish rush took place later . '
'so i laid her in these ruts .
that was where she must 'ave scraped her <unk> a bit .
then they turned sharp right  the ruts did  and then she stopped <unk> in a <unk> , sir ; but i 'll swear it was all of a one in three <unk> .
i think it was a <unk> .
we waited there , ' said leggatt .
'but not for long , ' said pyecroft .
'the lights were towering out of the drums on the position we 'ad so valiantly abandoned ; and the <name> service was <unk> ' it en <unk> .
when numerous bodies of <unk> trained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite directions , each remarking briskly , " what the <unk> did you do that for ? "
<unk> , as you might say , is practically assured .
they didn't ask for extraneous aids .
if we 'd come out with sworn <unk> of what we 'd done they would n't 'ave believed us .
they wanted each other's company exclusive .
such was the effect of <unk> on their <unk> feelings .
<unk> , i call it !
events transpired with the utmost velocity and rapidly increasing pressures .
there was a few remarks about dicky <unk> and mechanical horses , and then some one was smacked  hard by the sound  in the middle of a remark . '
'that was the man who kept calling for the <unk> dragoons , ' said leggatt .
'he got as far as drag ... ' 'was it ? '
said pyecroft dreamily .
'well , he could n't say they didn't come .
they all came , and they all fell to <unk> ' whether the infantry should 'ave <unk> for a regimental pet or the cavalry should keep him for stud purposes .
hence the issue was soon clouded with <unk> .
our commander said we 'ad sowed the good seed , and it was bearing abundant fruit .
( they weigh between four and seven pounds apiece . )
seein ' the children 'ad got over their shyness , and 'ad really begun to play games , we backed out o ' the pit and went down , by steps , to the camp below , no man , as you might say , making us afraid .
here we enjoyed a front view of the battle , which rolled with renewed impetus , owing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute .
all arms were freely represented ; cavalry , on this occasion only , acting in concert with artillery .
they argued the relative merits of horses <unk> feet , so to say , but they did n't neglect <unk> .
the wounded rolling downhill with the <unk> informed us that he had long ago been <unk> , and the smallest souvenirs were worth a man 's life .
speaking broadly , the <name> service appeared to be a shade out of 'and , if i may venture so far .
they did not pay prompt and <unk> obedience to the " retires " or the " cease fires " or the " for <unk> 's sake come to bed , <unk> " of their officers , who , i regret to say , were <unk> <unk> at the heads of their respective units . '
'how did you find that out ? '
i asked .
'on account of lootenant morshed going to the mess tent to call on his uncle and raise a drink ; but all hands had gone to the front .
we thought we 'eard somebody bathing behind the tent , and we found an <unk> gentleman tryin ' to drown a boy in <unk> in a <unk> .
he kept him under with a bicycle , so to speak .
he 'ad nearly accomplished his fell design , when we frustrated him .
he was in a highly <unk> condition and full o ' juice de spree .
" <unk> not what i am , " he says .
" my wife 'll tell me that quite soon enough .
<unk> rather what i've been , " he says .
" i 've been <unk> ' here , " he says .
" i commanded 'em in the <unk> , " he says , " and , gawd forgive me , " he says , <unk> <unk> , " i 've spent this holy evening telling their colonel they was a set of educated <unk> .
hark to 'em ! "
we could , without <unk> ourselves ; but how he picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in that <unk> party up the hill i do n't know .
" they 've marched and fought thirty mile to-day , " he shouts , " and now they 're <unk> ' the intestines out of the cavalry up yonder !
they wo n't stop this side the gates o ' delhi , " he says .
" i commanded their ancestors .
there 's nothing wrong with the service , " he says , wringing out his trousers on his lap .
" <unk> pardon me for <unk> ' 'em !
same old game  same young beggars . "
'the boy in the <unk> , languishing on a chair , puts in a claim for one drink .
" let him go dry , " says our friend in <unk> .
" he 's a reporter .
he run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if i could furnish 'im with particulars about the mutiny in the army .
you <unk> <unk> <unk> , " he says , shakin ' his finger at 'im  for he was <unk> annoyed  " i 'll teach you to defile what you can't <unk> !
when my regiment 's in a state o ' mutiny , i 'll do myself the honour of informing you personally .
you particularly ignorant and very <unk> little man , " he says , " you 're no better than a <unk> 's donkey !
if there was n't dirty linen to wash , you 'd starve , " he says , " and why i have n't drowned you <name> be the <unk> ' regret of my life . "
'well , we sat with 'em and 'ad drinks for about half-an-hour in front of the mess tent .
he 'd <name> ' killed the reporter if there had n't been witnesses , and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle ; so we acted as <unk> <unk> , in a sense .
i do n't hold with the press mingling up with service matters .
they draw false conclusions .
now , <name> you , at a moderate estimate , there were seven thousand men in the fighting line , half of 'em hurt in their professional feelings , an ' the other half <unk> ' in the <unk> , as you might say .
all due to <unk> !
if you 'ad n't seen it you would n't 'ave believed it .
and yet , <name> you , not one single unit of 'em even resorted to his belt .
they confined themselves to natural <unk>  hands and the <unk> .
i thought <name> was havin ' fits , till it <unk> the same thought had impressed him in the french language .
he called it <unk> , i believe .
seven thousand men , with seven thousand rifles , belts , and bayonets , in a violently agitated condition , and not a <unk> blow struck from first to last .
the old gentleman <name> our attention to it as well .
it was quite noticeable .
<unk> of ammunition was the <unk> cause of the battle <unk> ' .
a <unk> came in , <unk> ' his nose on both cuffs , and sayin ' he 'ad 'ad snuff .
the <unk> followed .
he was , so to speak , <unk> ' .
we thought it best to shift our moorings without <unk> ' attention ; so we shifted .
they 'ad called the cows 'ome by then .
the <name> service was going to <unk> all round us , as happy as the ship 's monkey when he 's been playin ' with the paints , and lootenant morshed and <name> kept <unk> ' to port and starboard of the <unk> , <unk> ' the <unk> applause which the multitude would 'ave given 'em if they'd known the facts .
on the other 'and , as your mr. leggatt observed , they might 'ave killed us .
'that would have been about five bells in the middle watch , say half-past two .
a <unk> evening .
there was but little to be gained by entering portsmouth at that hour , so we turned off on the grass ( this was after we had found a road under us ) , and we cast anchors out at the stern and prayed for the day .
'but your mr. leggatt he had to make and mend <unk> all our watch below .
it <unk> she had been running on the rim o ' two or three wheels , which , very properly , he had n't reported till the close of the action .
and that 's the reason of your four new <unk> .
mr. morshed was of opinion you 'd earned 'em .
do you dissent ? '
i stretched out my hand , which pyecroft crushed to pulp .
'no , pye , ' i said , deeply moved , 'i agree entirely .
but what happened to <name> ? '
'we returned him to his own navy after breakfast .
he would n't have kept much longer without some one in his own language to tell it to .
i don't know any man i ever took more compassion on than <name> .
'is sufferings swelled him up <unk> , and all he could do on the hard was to kiss lootenant morshed and me , and your mr. leggatt .
he deserved that much .
a cordial beggar . '
pyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table , and the low <name> on my car 's back in the yard .
'too early to drink to him , ' he said .
'but i feel it just the same . '
the uncle , sunk in his chair , snored a little ; the canary answered with a shrill <unk> .
pyecroft picked up the duster , threw it over the cage , put his finger to his lips , and we tiptoed out into the shop , while leggatt brought the car round .
'i 'll look out for the news in the papers , ' i said , as i got in .
'oh , we <unk> that !
nothing <unk> excep ' a statement to the effect that some territorial battalions had played about with turnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres the <unk> do n't know all he gets for his money .
farewell ! '
we moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the station to <unk> for london .
<unk> your pardon , sir , ' said a sergeant in charge of the baggage , 'but would you mind <unk> ' a bit till we get the <unk> past ? '
'certainly , ' i said .
'you do n't happen to have a <unk> among your <name> , do you ? '
the rattle of our reverse drowned his answer , but i saw his eyes .
one of them was <unk> , about four days old .
the legend of mirth the four archangels , so the legends tell , <name> , <name> , <name> , <unk> , being first of those to whom the power was shown , stood first of all the host before the throne , and when the charges were allotted burst <unk> from out the assembly first .
zeal was their spur that bade them strictly heed their own high judgment on their lightest deed .
zeal was their spur that , when relief was given , urged them unwearied to fresh toil in heaven ; for honour 's sake perfecting every task beyond what e'en perfection 's self could ask ... . and allah , who created zeal and pride , knows how the twain are <unk> allied .
it chanced on one of heaven 's <unk> days , the four and all the host having gone their ways each to his charge , the shining courts were void save for one seraph whom no charge employed , with <unk> wings and <unk> brow .
to whom the word : <unk> , what dost thou ? '
'by the permission , ' came the answer soft , 'little i do nor do that little oft .
as is the <name> in heaven so on earth where by the <name> i strive to make men mirth . '
he ceased and sped , hearing the word once more : <unk> , go thy way and greet the four . '
systems and <unk> <unk> , the seraph came upon the four , at last , guiding and guarding with devoted mind the tedious generations of mankind who lent at most unwilling ear and eye when they could not escape the ministry ... .
yet , patient , faithful , firm , persistent , just toward all that gross , indifferent , facile dust , the archangels laboured to discharge their trust by precept and example , prayer and law , advice , reproof , and rule , but , labouring , saw each in his fellow 's countenance confessed , the doubt that <unk> : 'have i done my best ? '
even as they sighed and turned to toil anew , the seraph hailed them with observance due ; and after some fit talk of higher things touched tentative on mundane happenings .
this they permitting , he , emboldened thus , <unk> of <unk> promiscuous .
and , since the large contention less avails than instances observed , he told them tales  tales of the shop , the bed , the court , the street , intimate , elemental , indiscreet : occasions where confusion <unk> swift piles jest on jest as <unk> pile the drift .
whence , one by one , beneath derisive skies , the victims bare , bewildered heads arise : tales of the passing of the spirit , graced with humour blinding as the doom it faced : stark tales of <unk> that broke aside to tears , by laughter swallowed ere they dried : tales to which neither <name> nor gain <unk> , but only ( allah be exalted ! )
true , and only , as the seraph showed that night , <unk> to the limits of delight .
these he rehearsed with artful pause and halt , and such pretence of memory at fault , that soon the four  so well the bait was thrown  came to his aid with memories of their own  matters dismissed long since as small or vain , whereof the high significance had lain hid , till the <unk> <unk> made it plain .
then as enlightenment came broad and fast , each marvelled at his own oblivious past until  the gates of laughter opened wide  the four , with that bland seraph at their side , while they recalled , compared , and <unk> , in utter mirth forgot both zeal and pride .
high over heaven the lamps of midnight burned ere , weak with merriment , the four returned , not in that order they were wont to keep  <unk> to <unk> answering , sweep for sweep , in awful <unk> heard afar , but <unk> adrift 'twixt <name> and <name> .
reeling a planet 's orbit left or right as laughter took them in the <unk> night ; or , by the point of some remembered jest , winged and brought helpless down through <unk> <unk> , where the blank worlds that gather to the birth leaped in the womb of darkness at their mirth , and e'en gehenna 's <unk> understood .
they were not damned from human brotherhood .
not first nor last of heaven 's high host , the four that night took place beneath the throne once more .
o lovelier than their morning majesty , the understanding light behind the eye !
o more compelling than their old command , the <unk> friendly gesture of the hand !
o sweeter than their zealous fellowship , the wise <unk> that passed from lip to lip !
o well and roundly , when command was given , they told their tale against themselves to heaven , and in the silence , waiting on the word , received the peace and pardon of the lord !
'my son 's <unk> ( 1913 ) he had suffered from the disease of the century since his early youth , and before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it .
he and a few friends had rearranged heaven very comfortably , but the <unk> of earth , which they called society , was even greater fun .
it demanded work in the shape of many <unk> daily ; hours of brilliant talk with brilliant talkers ; some sparkling correspondence ; a few silences ( but on the understanding that their own turn should come soon ) while other people expounded philosophies ; and a fair number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , theatres , <unk> , and <unk> shows ; the whole trimmed with <unk> to women whose hair smelt of <unk> .
such strong days sent <unk> midmore back to his flat assured that he and his friends had helped the world a step nearer the truth , the <name> , and the new order .
his temperament , he said , led him more towards concrete data than abstract ideas .
people who investigate detail are apt to be tired at the day 's end .
the same temperament , or it may have been a woman , made him early attach himself to the immoderate left of his cause in the capacity of an <unk> in social relations .
and since the immoderate left contains plenty of women anxious to help <name> <unk> with large independent incomes to arrive at <unk> of essentials , <unk> midmore 's lot was far from contemptible .
at that hour fate chose to play with him .
a widowed aunt , widely separated by nature , and more widely by marriage , from all that midmore 's mother had ever been or desired to be , died and left him possessions .
mrs. midmore , having that summer embraced a creed which denied the existence of death , naturally could not stoop to burial ; but midmore had to leave london for the dank country at a season when social regeneration works best through long , cushioned conferences , two by two , after tea .
there he faced the bracing ritual of the british funeral , and was wept at across the raw grave by an elderly <unk> female with a long nose , who called him <unk> <name> ' ; and there he was congratulated behind an echoing <unk> by a man he mistook for a mute , who turned out to be his aunt 's lawyer .
he wrote his mother next day , after a bright account of the funeral : 'so far as i can understand , she has left me between four and five hundred a year .
it all comes from ther land , as they call it down here .
the unspeakable attorney , sperrit , and a <unk> daughter , who <unk> to herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except " huntin ' , " insisted on taking me to see it .
ther land is brown and green in alternate slabs like chocolate and <unk> cakes , speckled with occasional peasants who do not utter .
in case it should not be wet enough there is a wet <name> in the middle of it .
ther house is by the <name> .
i shall look into it later .
if there should be any little memento of <name> that you care for , let me know .
did n't you tell me that <unk> furniture is coming into the market again ?
<name> 's old maid  it is called <name> <unk>  tells me that <name> promised it thirty pounds a year .
the <name> does not .
hence , i suppose , the tears at the funeral .
but that is close on ten per cent of the income .
i fancy <name> has destroyed all her private papers and records of her vie <unk> , if , indeed , life be possible in such a place .
the sperrit man told me that if i had means of my own i might come and live on ther land .
i did n't tell him how much i would pay not to !
i can not think it right that any human being should exercise mastery over others in the merciless fashion our <unk> social system permits ; so , as it is all mine , i intend to sell it whenever the unholy sperrit can find a purchaser . '
and he went to mr. sperrit with the idea next day , just before returning to town .
<unk> so , ' said the lawyer .
'i see your point , of course .
but the house itself is rather old-fashioned  hardly the type <unk> demand nowadays .
there 's no park , of course , and the bulk of the land is let to a <unk> , a mr. <name> .
as long as he pays his rent , he ca n't be turned out , and even if he did n't '  mr. sperrit 's face relaxed a shade  'you might have a difficulty . '
'the property brings four hundred a year , i understand , ' said midmore .
'well , hardly  <unk> .
<unk> land and income tax , <unk> , fire insurance , cost of collection and repairs of course , it returned two hundred and eighty-four pounds last year .
the repairs are rather a large item  owing to the <name> .
i call it <unk>  out of <name> , you know . '
midmore looked at his watch impatiently .
'i suppose you can find somebody to buy it ? '
he repeated .
'we <name> do our best , of course , if those are your instructions .
then , that is all except '  here midmore half rose , but mr. sperrit 's little grey eyes held his large brown ones firmly  <unk> about <name> <unk> , mrs. <unk> 's maid .
i may tell you that we did not draw up your <unk> last <name> .
she grew secretive towards the last  elderly people often do  and had it done in london .
i expect her memory failed her , or she mislaid her notes .
she used to put them in her <unk> ... . my motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station , mr. midmore ... but , as i was saying , whenever she made her <name> with us , mrs. <unk> always left <name> thirty pounds per annum .
<name> , the wills ! '
a clerk with a <unk> head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like cards , and breathed heavily behind midmore .
'it 's in no sense a legal obligation , of course , ' said mr. sperrit .
'ah , that one is dated <name> the 11th , eighteen <unk> . '
midmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good <name> : 'well , i suppose she 'd better have it  for the present at any rate . '
he escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fifty-four pounds a year was not exactly four hundred , and that <name> 's long nose annoyed him .
then he returned , first-class , to his own affairs .
of the two , perhaps three , experiments in social relations which he had then in hand , one interested him acutely .
it had run for some months and promised most variegated and interesting developments , on which he dwelt luxuriously all the way to town .
when he reached his flat he was not well prepared for a <unk> letter explaining , in the diction of the immoderate left which <unk> its i 's and <unk> its t 's , that the <name> had realised greater attractions in another soul .
she <unk> , rather than pleaded , the gospel of the immoderate left as her justification , and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to express herself in and on her own life , through which , she pointed out , she could pass but once .
she added that if , later , she should discover midmore was <unk> <unk> to her needs , ' she would tell him so .
that midmore had himself written much the same sort of epistle  barring the hint of return  to a woman of whom his needs for <unk> had caused him to weary three years before , did not assist him in the least .
he expressed himself to the <unk> in terms essential but not complimentary .
then he reflected on the detached criticism of his best friends and her best friends , male and female , with whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their <name> adventure was in flower .
he recalled , too  this must have been about midnight  her analysis from every <name> , remote and most intimate , of the mate to whom she had been <unk> under the base convention which is styled marriage .
later , at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a little , he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell appointed ; desolate , desiring , with no god to call upon .
about eleven o'clock next morning <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> called upon him 'for they had made appointment together ' to see how he took it ; but the janitor told them that job had gone  into the country , he believed .
midmore 's relief when he found his story was not written across his aching temples for mr. sperrit to read  the defeated lover , like the successful one , believes all earth privy to his soul  was put down by mr. sperrit to quite different causes .
he led him into a <unk> .
the rest of the house seemed to be full of people , singing to a loud piano idiotic songs about cows , and the hall smelt of damp cloaks .
'it 's our evening to take the <name> <unk> , ' mr. sperrit explained .
'it 's " high tide on the coast of <unk> . "
i hoped you 'd come back .
there are scores of little things to settle .
as for the house , of course , it stands ready for you at any time .
i could n't get <name> out of it  nor could <name> for that matter .
she 's the sister , is n't she , of the nurse who brought you down here when you were four , she says , to recover from measles ? '
'is she ?
was i ? '
said midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth .
'd'you suppose i could stay there the night ? '
thirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk>  <unk> ! '
mr. sperrit had to raise his voice above the din .
'well , if i asked you to stay here , i should never hear the last of it from <name> .
she 's a little cracked , of course , but the soul of devotion and capable of anything .
ne sit <unk> , you know . '
'thank you .
then i 'll go .
i 'll walk . '
he stumbled out dazed and sick into the <name> twilight , and sought the square house by the <name> .
it was not a dignified entry , because when the door was <unk> and <name> exclaimed , he took two valiant steps into the hall and then fainted  as men sometimes <name> after twenty-two hours of strong emotion and little food .
'i 'm sorry , ' he said when he could speak .
he was lying at the foot of the stairs , his head on <name> 's lap .
'your 'ome is your castle , sir , ' was the reply in his hair .
'i smelt it was n't drink .
you lay on the sofa till i get your supper . '
she settled him in a drawing-room <name> with yellow silk , heavy with the smell of dead leaves and oil lamp .
something murmured soothingly in the background and overcame the noises in his head .
he thought he heard horses ' feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks and grass .
it passed close to the shuttered <unk> .
but each <name> mourn his own , she saith , and sweeter woman ne'er <name> breath than my son 's wife , <name> ... <unk>  <unk>  <unk>  calling .
the hoofs broke into a canter as <name> entered with the tray .
'and then i 'll put you to bed , ' she said .
<unk> 's coming in the morning . '
midmore asked no questions .
he dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and would have pitied it all over again , but the food and warm <name> and water drugged him to instant sleep .
<name> 's voice wakened him , asking whether he would have <unk> , foot , or <unk> , ' which he understood were the baths of the establishment .
<unk> you try all three , ' she suggested .
'they 're all yours , you know , sir . '
he would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight , but her words struck him pleasantly .
everything his eyes opened upon was his very own to keep for ever .
the carved <unk> <unk> bed , obviously worth hundreds ; the wavy walnut <name> and <name> chairs  he had seen worse ones labelled twenty guineas apiece ; the oval <unk> mirror ; the delicate <unk> wire <unk> ; the heavy <unk> curtains were his  all his .
so , too , a great garden full of birds that faced him when he shaved ; a mulberry tree , a <unk> , and a dull , <unk> <name> that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away .
peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee that he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing , all set round with mysterious doors and <unk> prints .
he spent two hours after breakfast in exploring his new possessions .
his heart leaped up at such things as <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in a tiled passage , a <unk> malacca cane , boxes and boxes of unopened stationery , <unk> , bunches of keys , and at the bottom of a <unk> <unk> a little leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven shillings in silver .
'you used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after your measles , ' said <name> as he slipped the money into his pocket .
'now , this was your pore dear auntie 's <unk> . '
she opened a low door .
'oh , i forgot about mr. <name> !
there he is . '
an enormous old man with <unk> red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an empire chair , his cap in his hands .
<name> withdrew sniffing .
the man looked midmore over in silence , then jerked a thumb towards the door .
'i reckon she told you who i be , ' he began .
'i 'm the only farmer you 've got .
nothin ' goes off my place 'thout it walks on its own feet .
what about my <unk> ? '
'well , what about it ? '
said midmore .
'that 's just what i be come about .
the county councils are getting more particular .
did ye know there was swine fever at <unk> 's ?
there be .
it 'll 'ave to be in brick . '
'yes , ' said midmore politely .
'i 've bin at your aunt that was , plenty times about it .
i do n't say she was n't a just woman , but she did n't read the lease same way i did .
i be used to bein ' put upon , but there 's no doing any longer 'thout that <unk> . '
'when would you like it ? '
midmore asked .
it seemed the easiest road to take .
'any time or other suits me , i reckon .
he ai n't <unk> ' where he is , an ' i paid eighteen shillin ' for him . '
he crossed his hands on his stick and gave no further sign of life .
'is that all ? '
midmore stammered .
'all now  excep "  he glanced <unk> at the table beside him  <unk> my <unk> .
where 's that <name> ? '
midmore rang the <name> .
<name> came in with a bottle and a glass .
the old man helped himself to four stiff fingers , rose in one piece , and stumped out .
at the door he cried ferociously : 'do n't suppose it 's any odds to you whether i 'm drowned or not , but them <unk> want a wheel and winch , they do .
i be too old for <unk> ' 'em with the bar  my time o ' life . '
'good riddance if 'e was drowned , ' said <name> .
'but do n't you mind him .
he 's only <unk> ' himself .
your pore dear auntie used to give 'im 'is usual  't is n't the whisky you drink  an ' send 'im about 'is business . '
'i see .
now , is a <unk> the same thing as a <unk> ? '
<name> nodded .
<unk> needs one , too , but 'e ai n't entitled to it .
you look at 'is lease  third drawer on the left in that bombay <unk>  an ' next time 'e comes you ask 'im to read it .
that 'll choke 'im off , because 'e ca n't ! '
there was nothing in midmore 's past to teach him the message and significance of a <unk> lease of the late <unk> , but <name> interpreted .
'it do n't mean anything <unk> , ' was her cheerful conclusion , <unk> you must n't get rid of him anyhow , an ' 'e can do what 'e likes always .
lucky for us 'e do farm ; and if it was n't for 'is woman  ' 'oh , there 's a mrs. <name> , is there ? '
<unk> , no ! '
the <unk> do n't marry .
they keep .
that 's his fourth since  to my knowledge .
he was a takin ' man from the first . '
'any families ? '
'they 'd be grown up by now if there was , would n't they ?
but you can't spend all your days <unk> ' 'is interests .
that 's what gave your pore aunt 'er indigestion .
'ave you seen the <unk> ? '
midmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure .
but there was no denying that the late colonel <unk> 's <unk> <unk> were good at their filthy job .
he loaded one , took it out and pointed  merely pointed  it at a <unk> which rose out of a shrubbery behind the kitchen , and the flaming bird came down in a long slant on the lawn , stone dead .
<name> from the <unk> said it was a lovely shot , and told him lunch was ready .
he spent the afternoon gun in one hand , a map in the other , beating the bounds of his lands .
they lay altogether in a shallow , uninteresting valley , flanked with woods and bisected by a <name> .
up stream was his own house ; down stream , less than half a mile , a low red farm-house squatted in an old orchard , beside what looked like small <unk> on the thames .
there was no doubt as to ownership .
mr. <name> saw him while yet far off , and bellowed at him about <unk> and <unk> .
these last were two great sliding shutters of <unk> oak across the <name> , which were <unk> up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip of iron , and when <name> opened them they at once let out half the water .
midmore watched it shrink between its <unk> banks like some <unk> trick .
this , too , was his very own .
'i see , ' he said .
'how interesting !
now , what 's that <name> for ? '
he went on , pointing to an old ship 's <name> in a rude belfry at the end of an <unk> .
'was that a chapel once ? '
the <unk> giant seemed to have difficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely .
'yes , ' he said at last .
'my chapel .
when you 'ear that <name> ring you'll 'ear something .
nobody but me 'ud put up with it  but i reckon it don't make any odds to you . '
he slammed the gates down again , and the <name> rose behind them with a suck and a grunt .
midmore moved off , conscious that he might be safer with <name> to hold his conversational hand .
as he passed the front of the farm-house a smooth fat woman , with neatly parted grey hair under a widow 's cap , <unk> to him deferentially through the window .
by every teaching of the immoderate left she had a perfect right to express herself in any way she pleased , but the curtsey revolted him .
and on his way home he was hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his mouth , who <unk> and danced round him .
'what did that beast want ? '
he demanded of <name> at tea .
<unk> ?
he only wanted to know if you 'ad any telegrams to send .
<unk> go anywhere so long as 't is n't across running water .
that gives 'im 'is <unk> .
even talkin ' about it for fun like makes 'im shake . '
'but why is n't he where he can be properly looked after ? '
'what 'arm 's 'e doing ?
e 's a <unk> , but 'is family can pay for 'im .
if 'e was locked up 'e 'd die all off at once , like a wild rabbit .
won't you , please , look at the drive , sir ? '
midmore looked in the fading light .
the neat gravel was pitted with large <unk> holes , and there was a punch or two of the same sort on the lawn .
'that 's the <unk> comin ' 'ome , ' <name> explained .
'your pore dear auntie always let 'em use our drive for a short cut after the colonel died .
the colonel would n't so much because he preserved ; but your auntie was always an <unk> till 'er <unk> . '
'is n't there some one who can rake it over or  or something ? '
said midmore vaguely .
'oh yes .
you 'll never see it in the morning , but  you was out when they came 'ome an ' mister fisher  he 's the master  told me to tell you with 'is compliments that if you was n't <unk> ' and cared to 'old to the old understanding ' , is <unk> is at your service same as before .
'e thought , perhaps , you might n't know , and it 'ad slipped my mind to tell you .
it 's good gravel , mister fisher 's , and it binds beautiful on the drive .
we 'ave to draw it , o ' course , from the pit , but  ' midmore looked at her helplessly .
<unk> , ' said he , 'what am i supposed to do ? '
'oh , let 'em come through , ' she replied .
'you never know .
you may want to <unk> yourself some day . '
that evening it rained and his misery returned on him , the worse for having been diverted .
at last he was driven to paw over a few score books in a <unk> room called the library , and realised with horror what the late colonel <unk> 's mind must have been in its prime .
the volumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew .
he opened and thrust them back , one after another , till crude coloured illustrations of men on horses held his eye .
he began at random and read a little , moved into the drawing-room with the volume , and settled down by the fire still reading .
it was a foul world into which he peeped for the first time  a <unk> , <unk> hell of <unk> , swindlers , <unk> mothers , <unk> dependent virgins selling themselves <unk> for cash and lands : jews , tradesmen , and an <unk> spawn of <unk> characters ( i give midmore 's own criticism ) , but he read on , fascinated , and behold , from the pages leaped , as it were , the brother to the <unk> man of the <name> , bellowing at a landlord ( here midmore realised that he was that very animal ) for new barns ; and another man who , like himself again , objected to <unk> on gravel .
outrageous as thought and <name> were , the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation .
he dug out other volumes by the same author , till <name> came in with a silver candlestick .
<unk> , ' said he , 'did you ever hear about a character called <name> <unk>  and <unk> ? '
'why , o ' course , ' said she .
'the colonel used to come into the kitchen in 'is <unk> an ' read us all those <unk> . '
'oh , lord ! '
said midmore , and went to bed with a book called <unk> cross under his arm , and a <unk> <name> into a stranger world the <unk> moon never looked upon .
* * * * * here we omit much .
but midmore never denied that for the <unk> in sensation the urgent needs of an ancient house , as interpreted by <name> pointing to daylight through <unk> held in place by moss , gives an edge to the pleasure of social research elsewhere .
equally he found that the reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror if one knows one can at <name> bathe the soul in the society of <unk> ( all the <unk> had chronic <unk> ) , village idiots ( <name> had taken midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the <unk> ) , and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an <unk> outrage .
towards spring midmore filled his house with a few friends of the immoderate left .
it happened to be the day when , all things and <name> working together , a <unk> of bricks , another of sand , and some bags of lime had been despatched to build <name> his almost <unk> <unk> .
midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some idea of showing them <name> as a type of 'the peasantry . '
they hit the minute when <name> , hoarse with rage , was ordering <unk> , mate , carts and all off his premises .
the visitors disposed themselves to listen .
'you never give me no notice about changin ' the pig , ' <name> shouted .
the pig  at least eighteen inches long  reared on end in the old sty and smiled at the company .
'but , my good man  ' midmore opened .
'i ai n't !
for aught you know i be a dam ' sight worse than you be .
you ca n't come and <unk> <unk> with me .
you are <unk> ' <unk> !
all you men go clean away an ' do n't set foot on my land till i bid ye . '
'but you asked '  midmore felt his voice jump up  'to have the <unk> built . '
<unk> i did .
that 's no reason you should n't send me notice to change the pig .
<unk> ' down on me like this 'thout warnin ' !
that pig 's got to be got into the <unk> an ' all . '
'then open the door and let him run in , ' said midmore .
'do n't you <unk> <unk> with me !
take all your dam ' men 'ome off my land .
i wo n't be treated <unk> . '
the carts moved off without a word , and <name> went into the house and slammed the door .
'now , i hold that is enormously significant , ' said a visitor .
'here you have the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppression  the frenzy of fear . '
the company looked at midmore with grave pain .
'but he did worry my life out about his <unk> , ' was all midmore found to say .
others took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the gospels of the immoderate left the earth would soon be covered with <unk> little ' <unk> , built in the intervals of <unk> by 'the peasant ' himself .
midmore felt grateful when the door opened again and mr. <name> invited them all to retire to the road which , he pointed out , was public .
as they turned the corner of the house , a <unk> woman in a <unk> cap <unk> to each of them through the window .
instantly they <name> pictures of that woman 's lot , deprived of all vehicle for <unk>  'the set grey life and <unk> end , ' one quoted  and they discussed the tremendous significance of village theatricals .
even a month ago midmore would have told them all that he knew and <name> had dropped about <name> 's forms of <unk> .
now , for some strange reason , he was content to let the talk run on from village to metropolitan and world drama .
<name> advised him after the visitors left that 'if he wanted to do that again ' he had better go up to town .
'but we only sat on cushions on the floor , ' said her master .
'they 're too old for <unk> , ' she retorted , 'an ' it 's only the beginning of things .
i 've seen what i've seen .
besides , they talked and laughed in the passage going to their baths  such as took 'em . '
'do n't be a fool , <name> , ' said midmore .
no man  unless he has loved her  <name> casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head .
'very good , ' she snorted , 'but that cuts both ways .
an ' now , you go down to <name> 's this evenin ' and put him where he ought to be .
he was in his right about you givin ' 'im notice about changin ' the pig , but he <unk> any right to turn it up before your company .
no manners , no <unk> .
he 'll understand . '
midmore did his best to make him .
he found himself <unk> the old man in speech and with a <name> quite new in all his experience .
he wound up  it was a plagiarism from a <unk>  by telling mr. <name> that he looked like a turkey-cock , had the morals of a parish bull , and need never <name> for a new <unk> as long as he or midmore lived .
'very good , ' said the giant .
'i reckon you thought you 'ad something against me , and now you 've come down an ' told it me like man to man .
quite right .
i do n't bear malice .
now , you send along those bricks an' sand , an ' i 'll make a do to build the <unk> myself .
if you look at my lease you 'll find out you 're bound to provide me materials for the repairs .
only  only i thought there 'd be no 'arm in my askin ' you to do it throughout like . '
midmore fairly gasped .
'then , why the devil did you turn my carts back when  when i sent them up here to do it throughout for you ? '
mr. <name> sat down on the <unk> , his eyebrows knitted in thought .
'i 'll tell you , ' he said slowly .
"twas too dam ' like <unk> ' a <unk> baby .
my woman , she said so too . '
for a few seconds the teachings of the immoderate left , whose humour is all their own , wrestled with those of mother earth , who has her own humours .
then midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand .
in due time mr. <name> laughed too  crowing and wheezing <unk> till it broke from him in roars .
they shook hands , and midmore went home grateful that he had held his tongue among his companions .
when he reached his house he met three or four men and women on <unk> , very muddy indeed , coming down the drive .
feeling hungry himself , he asked them if they were hungry .
they said they were , and he bade them enter .
<name> took their horses , who seemed to know him .
<name> took their battered hats , led the women upstairs for <unk> , and presently fed them all with <unk> , <unk> eggs , <unk> toast , and drinks from a <unk> <unk> case which midmore had never known that he possessed .
'and i <name> say , ' said miss <name> sperrit , her spurred foot on the fender and a smoking <unk> in her whip hand , <unk> does one <unk> .
she always did since i was eight . '
<unk> , miss , was when you began to <unk> , ' said <name> , setting down more buttered toast .
'and so , ' the <unk> .
was saying to midmore , 'when he got to your brute <name> 's land , we had to whip 'em off .
it 's a regular <unk> for 'em .
they know it .
why '  he dropped his voice  'i do n't want to say anything against <name> as your tenant , of course , but i do believe the old scoundrel 's perfectly capable of putting down poison . '
<unk> 's capable of anything , ' said midmore with immense feeling ; but once again he held his tongue .
they were a queer community ; yet when they had stamped and jingled out to their horses again , the house felt hugely big and disconcerting .
this may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life .
it ran in odd channels that summer  a riding school , for instance , near hayes common and a shooting ground near <unk> <unk> .
a man who has been <unk> or <unk> for half the day is not at his london best of evenings ; and when the bills for his amusements come in he <unk> his expenses in other directions .
so a cloud settled on midmore 's name .
his london world talked of a <unk> of heart and a tightening of <unk> which signified <unk> to the cause .
one man , a confidant of the old expressive days , attacked him <unk> and demanded account of his soul 's progress .
it was not furnished , for midmore was calculating how much it would cost to <unk> stables so dilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting <unk> horses into them .
the man went away , and served up what he had heard of the <unk> episode as a little newspaper sketch , calculated to annoy .
midmore read it with an eye as practical as a woman 's , and since most of his experiences had been among women , at once sought out a woman to whom he might tell his sorrow at the <unk> of his own familiar friend .
she was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised heart  she knew all about it  had found <unk> , with a long o , in another quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be betrayed to other loyal friends .
as his hints pointed directly towards facile <unk> , and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse from a dealer , <unk> way , he felt he had done good work .
later , when his friend , the scribe , talked to him <unk> of <unk> gardens ' and those <unk> to which every man who follows the wider morality is entitled , midmore lent him a <unk> note which he had got back on the price of a <unk> bay <unk> .
so true it is , as he read in one of the late colonel <unk> 's books , that 'the young man of the present day would sooner lie under an <unk> against his morals than against his knowledge of <unk> . '
midmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to ride and , above all , to jump on a <unk> bay <unk> with black points and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences .
he did not wish many people except mr. <name> , who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind the <unk> , to be privy to the matter , which he rightly foresaw would take him to the autumn .
so he told such friends as hinted at country week-end visits that he had practically let his newly inherited house .
the rent , he said , was an object to him , for he had lately lost large sums through <unk> <unk> .
he would name no names , but they could guess .
and they guessed loyally all round the circle of his acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much .
there remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to <unk> .
they were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal , of course , but as curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted .
midmore met them in a suburban train , coming up to town , not twenty minutes after he had come off two hours ' advanced tuition ( one guinea an hour ) over <unk> in a hall .
he had , of course , changed his <name> , but his too heavy <unk> shook a little among the newspapers .
on the inspiration of the moment , which is your natural liar 's best hold , he told them that he was condemned to a <unk> .
he would lie in semi-darkness drinking milk , for weeks and weeks , cut off even from letters .
he was astonished and delighted at the ease with which the usual lie <unk> the unusual intellect .
they swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live on nuts and fruit ; but he saw in the woman 's eyes the exact reason she would set forth for his retirement .
after all , she had as much right to express herself as he purposed to take for himself ; and midmore believed strongly in the fullest equality of the sexes .
that retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world .
the <name> who had written the <unk> letter ten months before sent him another of eight pages , <unk> all the motives that were leading her back to him  should she come ?  now that he was ill and alone .
much might yet be <unk> , she said , out of the waste of jarring lives and piteous <unk> .
it needed only a hand .
but midmore needed two , next morning very early , for a <unk> diversion , among wet <unk> , called <unk> . '
'you have n't a bad seat , ' said miss sperrit through the <unk> .
'but you 're worrying him . '
'he pulls so , ' midmore grunted .
'let him alone , then .
look out for the branches , ' she shouted , as they whirled up a <unk> ride .
cubs were plentiful .
most of the hounds attached themselves to a <unk> youngster of education who scuttled out of the woods into the open fields below .
'hold on ! '
some one shouted .
<unk> 'em , midmore .
that 's your brute <name> 's land .
it 's all wire . '
'oh , <name> , stop ! '
mrs. sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a <unk> .
<unk> be damned !
i had it all out a fortnight ago .
come on ! '
this was midmore , <unk> into it a little lower down .
'_i knew that ! '
<name> cried over her shoulder , and she flitted across the open pasture , humming to herself .
'oh , of course !
if some people have private information , they can afford to thrust . '
this was a <unk> habit into which miss sperrit had <unk> down the ride .
'what !
<unk> got <name> to heel ?
you never did that , sperrit . '
this was mr. fisher , <unk> , enlarging the breach midmore had made .
'no , confound him ! '
said the father testily .
'go on , sir !
<unk> ter <unk>  you 've kicked half the ditch into my eye already . '
they killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him to make for  a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> to which the <unk> .
had been denied access for the last fifteen seasons .
he expressed his gratitude before all the field and mr. <name> , at mr. <unk> farm-house door .
'and if there should be any poultry claims  ' he went on .
'there wo n't be , ' said midmore .
'it 's too like cheating a sucking child , is n't it , mr .
<name> ? '
'you 've got me ! '
was all the reply .
'i be used to bein ' put upon , but you 've got me , mus ' midmore . '
midmore pointed to a new brick <unk> built in strict disregard of the terms of the <unk> 's lease .
the gesture told the tale to the few who did not know , and they shouted .
such pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings when men and women elsewhere are at their brightest .
but midmore preferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch , reading works of a <unk> vulgarity ; or , by invitation , to dine with the <unk> and savages of their kidney .
these did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing .
they lied , except about horses , <unk> and of necessity , not for <unk> sake ; and , men and women alike , they expressed themselves along their chosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals .
then midmore would go home and identify them , one by one , out of the <unk> books by mr. <unk> , on the table beside the sofa .
at first they looked upon him coolly , but when the tale of the removed wire and the <unk> gorse had gone the rounds , they accepted him for a person willing to play their games .
true , a faction suspended judgment for a while , because they shot , and hoped that midmore would serve the glorious <unk> of <unk> rather than the unkempt god of <unk> .
but after he had shown his choice , they did not ask by what intellectual process he had arrived at it .
he hunted three , sometimes four , times a week , which necessitated not only one bay <unk> ( <unk> : <unk> .
) , but a <unk> <unk> chestnut ( <unk> ) , and a black mare , rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk ( <unk> ) , who so evidently preferred to <name> a <name> that it would have been cruel to have <unk> her .
besides , with that handling she could be sold at a profit .
and besides , the hunt was a quiet , intimate , kindly little hunt , not anxious for strangers , of good report in the field , the servant of one <unk> , given to hospitality , riding well its own horses , and , with the exception of midmore , not <unk> .
but as miss sperrit observed , after the <unk> .
had said some things to him at a gate : 'it is a pity you do n't know as much as your horse , but you <name> in time .
it takes years and <unk> .
i 've been at it for fifteen and i 'm only just learning .
but you 've made a decent <unk> . '
so he kicked off in wind and wet and mud , wondering quite sincerely why the bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day , or what <unk> he could find on off days in chasing grooms and <unk> round <unk> .
to make sure he <unk> himself one week-end of heavy <unk> rain , and re-entered his lost world in the character of <unk> fresh from a <unk> .
they all agreed , with an eye over his shoulder for the next comer , that he was a different man ; but when they asked him for the symptoms of nervous strain , and led him all through their own , he realised he had lost much of his old skill in lying .
his three <unk> absence , too , had put him hopelessly behind the london field .
the movements , the allusions , the slang of the game had changed .
the couples had rearranged themselves or were <unk> in fresh triangles , whereby he put his foot in it badly .
only one great soul ( he who had written the account of the <unk> episode ) stood untouched by the vast flux of time , and midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity .
a woman took him , in the wet forenoon , to a <unk> on the <unk> of impulse in humanity , which struck him as a <unk> <unk> of mr. <name> 's domestic arrangements , plus a clarion call to <unk> civilisation into common-sense . '
'and you 'll come to tea with me to-morrow ? '
she asked , after lunch , nibbling <unk> nuts from a saucer .
midmore replied that there were great arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for so long .
'but you 've come back like a giant refreshed ... .
i <name> that <name> '  this was the <name> of the twelve and the <unk> letter  'will be with us too .
she has misunderstood herself , like so many of us , ' the woman murmured , 'but i think eventually ... ' she flung out her thin little hands .
<unk> , these are things that each lonely soul must adjust for itself . '
'indeed , yes , ' said midmore with a deep sigh .
the old tricks were <unk> in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a <unk> .
he passed into an abrupt reverie , shook his head , as though stung by tumultuous memories , and departed without any ceremony of farewell to  catch a <unk> express where a man meets associates who talk horse , and weather as it affects the horse , all the way down .
what worried him most was that he had missed a day with the hounds .
he met <name> 's keen old eyes without <unk> ; and the drawing-room looked very comfortable that wet evening at tea .
after all , his visit to town had not been wholly a failure .
he had burned quite a bushel of letters at his flat .
a flat  here he reached mechanically towards the worn volumes near the sofa  a flat was a consuming animal .
as for <name> ... he opened at random on the words : 'his lordship then did as desired and disclosed a <unk> of considerable strength and variety . '
midmore reflected : 'and i used to think ... .
but she was n't ... . we were all <unk> and <unk> together ... .
i did n't babble much  thank goodness  but i skirted . '
he turned the pages backward for more <unk> <unk> , and read : 'when at length they rose to go to bed it struck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs , that the man before him walked very <unk> . '
he laughed aloud at the fire .
'what about to-morrow ? '
<name> asked , entering with garments over her shoulder .
'it 's never stopped raining since you left .
you 'll be plastered out of sight an ' all in five minutes .
you 'd better wear your next best , 'ad n't you ?
i 'm afraid they 've shrank .
'ad n't you best try 'em on ? '
'here ? '
said midmore .
<unk> yourself .
i bathed you when you was n't larger than a leg o' lamb , ' said the <unk> .
<unk> , one of these days i shall get a valet , and a married butler . '
'there 's many a true word spoke in jest .
but nobody 's <unk> to-morrow . '
'why ?
have they <unk> the meet ? '
'they say it only means slipping and <unk> in the mud , and they all 'ad enough of that to-day .
<name> told me so just now . '
'oh ! '
it seemed that the word of mr. sperrit 's confidential clerk had weight .
<unk> came down to help mr. <name> lift the gates , ' <name> continued .
'the <unk> ?
they are perfectly easy to handle now .
i 've put in a wheel and a winch . '
'when the <name> 's really up they must be took clean out on account of the rubbish <unk> ' 'em .
that 's why <name> came down . '
midmore grunted impatiently .
<unk> has talked to me about that <name> ever since i came here .
it 's never done anything yet . '
'this 'as been a dry summer .
if you care to look now , sir , i 'll get you a lantern . '
she paddled out with him into a large wet night .
half-way down the lawn her light was reflected on shallow brown water , pricked through with grass blades at the edges .
beyond that light , the <name> was <unk> and kicking among hedges and tree-trunks .
'what on earth <name> happen to the big <unk> ? '
was midmore 's first word .
'it generally 'as to be <unk> after a flood .
ah ! '
she raised her lantern .
'there 's two <unk> <unk> ' against the <unk> .
now , that wo n't do the roses any good . '
'this is too absurd .
there ought to be some decently <unk> system  for  for dealing with this sort of thing . '
he peered into the rushing gloom .
there seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket .
in town he had noticed nothing .
'it ca n't be <unk> , ' said <name> .
'it 's just what it does do once in just so often .
we 'd better go back . '
all earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards the hoarse <name> .
somebody wailed from the house : <unk> o ' the water !
come 'ere !
'fraid o ' the water ! '
'that 's <name> .
wet always takes 'im that way , ' she explained .
the idiot charged into them , shaking with terror .
<unk> <name> !
how brave of <name> !
come into the hall .
what <name> got now ? '
she <unk> .
it was a sodden note which ran : 'dear <name>  mr. <unk> , with whom i rode home this afternoon , told me that if this wet keeps up , he 's afraid the <unk> he built last year , where <unk> old <unk> was , <name> go , as the dam did once before , he says .
if it does it 's bound to come down the <name> .
it may be all right , but perhaps you had better look out .
c.s . '
'if <unk> 's dam goes , that means ... .
i 'll 'ave the drawing-room carpet up at once to be on the safe side .
the <unk> is in the <unk> . '
'wait a minute .
<name> 's gates are out , you said ? '
<unk> .
he 'll need it if <unk> 's pond goes ... .
i 've seen it once . '
'i 'll just slip down and have a look at <name> .
light the lantern again , please , <name> . '
'you wo n't get him to stir .
he 's been there since he was born .
but she do n't know anything .
i 'll fetch your waterproof and some <unk> . '
<unk> o ' the water !
'fraid o ' the water ! '
<name> sobbed , pressed against a corner of the hall , his hands to his eyes .
'all right , <name> .
<name> can help play with the carpet , ' <name> answered , as midmore went forth into the darkness and the <unk> all round .
he had never seen such an utterly <unk> state of affairs .
there was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive .
'hi !
<name> !
did you get my note ?
i came down to make sure .
i thought , afterwards , <name> might funk the water ! '
'it 's me  miss sperrit , ' midmore cried .
'yes , we got it , thanks . '
'you 're back , then .
oh , good ! ...
is it bad down with you ? '
'i 'm going to <name> 's to have a look . '
'you wo n't get him out .
<unk> i met <name> <unk> .
i told him he hadn't any business <unk> water for his idiotic trout without <unk> the dam . '
'how far up is it ?
i 've only been there once . '
'not more than four miles as the water <name> come .
he says he 's opened all the <unk> . '
she had turned and fallen into step beside him , her hooded head bowed against the thinning rain .
as usual she was humming to herself .
'why on earth did you come out in this weather ? '
midmore asked .
'it was worse when you were in town .
the rain 's taking off now .
if it was n't for that pond , i would n't worry so much .
there 's <name> 's <name> .
come on ! '
she broke into a run .
a cracked <name> was <unk> feebly down the valley .
'keep on the road ! '
midmore shouted .
the ditches were snorting <unk> on either side , and towards the <unk> the fields were afloat and beginning to move in the darkness .
<unk> me going off it !
there 's his light burning all right . '
she halted <unk> at a little rise .
'but the flood 's in the orchard .
look ! '
she swung her lantern to show a front rank of old <unk> reflected in still , <unk> waters beyond the <unk> hedge .
they could hear above the <unk> of the gorged <unk> , shrieks in two keys as monotonous as a <unk> .
'the high one 's the pig . '
miss sperrit laughed .
'all right !
i 'll get her out .
you stay where you are , and i 'll see you home afterwards . '
'but the water 's only just over the road , ' she objected .
'never mind .
do n't you move .
promise ? '
'all right .
you take my stick , then , and feel for holes in case anything 's washed out anywhere .
this is a lark ! '
midmore took it , and stepped into the water that moved <unk> as yet across the farm road which ran to <name> 's front door from the raised and <unk> public road .
it was half way up to his knees when he knocked .
as he looked back miss sperrit 's lantern seemed to float in <unk> .
'you ca n't come in or the water 'll come with you .
i 've <unk> up all the cracks , ' mr. <name> shouted from within .
'who be ye ? '
'take me out !
take me out ! '
the woman shrieked , and the pig from his sty behind the house urgently seconded the motion .
'i 'm midmore !
<unk> 's old <unk> is likely to go , they say .
come out ! '
'i told 'em it would when they made a <unk> of it .
't was n't ever <unk> proper .
but it 's a middlin ' wide valley .
she 's got room to spread ... . keep still , or i 'll take and duck you in the cellar ! ...
you go 'ome , mus ' midmore , an ' take the law o ' mus ' <unk> soon 's you've changed your socks . '
<unk> you , are n't you coming out ? '
'to catch my death o ' cold ?
i 'm all right where i be .
i 've seen it before .
but you can take her .
she 's no sort o ' use or sense ... .
climb out through the window .
did n't i tell you i 'd plugged the <unk> , you fool 's daughter ? '
the parlour window opened , and the woman flung herself into midmore 's arms , nearly knocking him down .
mr. <name> leaned out of the window , pipe in mouth .
'take her 'ome , ' he said , and added <unk> : 'two women in one house , two cats an ' one mouse , two dogs an ' one bone  which i <name> leave alone .
i 've seen it before . '
then he shut and fastened the window .
'a trap !
a trap !
you had ought to have brought a trap for me .
i 'll be drowned in this wet , ' the woman cried .
'hold up !
you ca n't be any <unk> than you are .
come along ! '
midmore did not at all like the feel of the water over his <unk> .
<unk> !
come along ! '
miss sperrit 's lantern , not fifty yards away , waved cheerily .
the woman threshed towards it like a panic-stricken goose , fell on her knees , was jerked up again by midmore , and pushed on till she collapsed at miss sperrit 's feet .
'but you wo n't get <unk> if you go straight to mr. <unk> house , ' said the unsympathetic maiden .
'o gawd !
o gawd !
i wish our <unk> father 'ud forgive me my sins an' call me 'ome , ' the woman sobbed .
'but i wo n't go to 'is 'ouse !
i wo n't . '
'all right , then .
stay here .
now , if we run , ' miss sperrit whispered to midmore , 'she 'll follow us .
not too fast ! '
they set off at a considerable trot , and the woman lumbered behind them , bellowing , till they met a third lantern  <name> holding <name> 's hand .
she had got the carpet up , she said , and was escorting <name> past the water that he dreaded .
'that 's all right , ' miss sperrit pronounced .
'take mrs. <name> back with you , <name> , and put her to bed .
i 'll take <name> with me .
you aren't afraid of the water now , are you , <name> ? '
'not afraid of anything now . '
<name> reached for her hand .
'but get away from the water quick . '
'i 'm coming with you , ' midmore interrupted .
'you most certainly are not .
you 're drenched .
she threw you twice .
go home and change .
you may have to be out again all night .
it 's only half-past seven now .
i 'm perfectly safe . '
she flung herself lightly over a stile , and hurried uphill by the <unk> , out of reach of all but the boasts of the flood below .
<name> , dead silent , <unk> mrs. <name> to the house .
'you 'll find your things laid out on the bed , ' she said to midmore as he came up .
i 'll attend to  to this .
she's got nothing to cry for . '
midmore raced into dry <name> , and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight of the lantern just turning into the <unk> ' gate .
he came back by way of <name> 's farm , where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of shining water , for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping overhead , though the <name> was <unk> than ever .
now there was only that doubtful mill-pond to look after  that and his swirling world abandoned to himself alone .
'we shall have to sit up for it , ' said <name> after dinner .
and as the drawing-room commanded the best view of the rising flood , they watched it from there for a long time , while all the clocks of the house bore them company .
"tis n't the water , it 's the mud on the <unk> after it goes down that i mind , ' <name> whispered .
'the last time <unk> 's mill broke , i remember it came up to the second  no , third  step o ' mr. <name> 's stairs . '
'what did <name> do about it ? '
'he made a notch on the step .
'e said it was a record .
just like 'im . '
'it 's up to the drive now , ' said midmore after another long wait .
'and the rain stopped before eight , you know . '
'then <unk> 's dam 'as broke , and that 's the first of the <unk> . '
she stared out beside him .
the water was rising in sudden pulses  an inch or two at a time , with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden increase of the <name> 's proper thunder .
'you ca n't stand all the time .
take a chair , ' midmore said presently .
<name> looked back into the bare room .
'the carpet bein ' up does make a difference .
thank you , sir , i <name> 'ave a <unk> . '
<unk> over the drive now , ' said midmore .
he opened the window and leaned out .
'is that wind up the valley , <name> ? '
'no , that 's it !
but i 've seen it before . '
there was not so much a roar as the <unk> drive of a tide across a jagged reef , which put down every other sound for twenty minutes .
a wide sheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house stood , pushed round either corner , rose again and stretched , as it were , yawning beneath the moonlight , joined other sheets waiting for them in unsuspected hollows , and lay out all in one .
a puff of wind followed .
'it 's right up to the wall now .
i can touch it with my finger . '
midmore bent over the window-sill .
'i can 'ear it in the cellars , ' said <name> dolefully .
'well , we 've done what we can !
i think i 'll 'ave a look . '
she left the room and was absent half an hour or more , during which time he saw a full-grown tree hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots .
then a <unk> knocked against the wall , caught on an iron <unk> just outside , and made a <unk> ripple .
the cascade through the <unk> diminished .
'it 's dropping , ' <name> cried , as she returned .
'it 's only <unk> ' into my cellars now . '
'wait a minute .
i believe  i believe i can see the <unk> on the edge of the drive just showing ! '
in another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel again , tilting all its water towards the shrubbery .
'the pond 's gone past , ' <name> announced .
'we shall only 'ave the common flood to contend with now .
you 'd better go to bed . '
'i ought to go down and have another look at <name> before daylight . '
'no need .
you can see 'is light burnin ' from all the upstairs windows . '
'by the way .
i forgot about her .
where 've you put her ? '
'in my bed . '
<name> 's tone was ice .
'i was n't going to undo a room for that stuff . '
'but it  it could n't be helped , ' said midmore .
'she was half drowned .
one must n't be <unk> , <name> , even if her position isn't quite  er  regular . '
<unk> !
i was n't <unk> ' about that . '
she leaned forward to the window .
'there 's the edge of the lawn showin ' now .
it falls as fast as it rises .
<unk> '  the change of tone made midmore jump  'did n't you know that i was 'is first ?
that's what makes it so hard to bear . '
midmore looked at the long <unk> back and had no words .
she went on , still talking through the black <unk> : 'your pore dear auntie was very kind about it .
she said she 'd make all allowances for one , but no more .
never any more ... . then , you didn't know 'oo <name> was all this time ? '
'your nephew , i always thought . '
'well , well , ' she spoke <unk> .
<unk> 's business being <unk> business , i suppose no one thought to tell you .
but <name> made 'is own way for <unk> from the beginnin ' ! ...
but her upstairs , she never produced anything .
just an <unk> , as you might say .
<unk> over an ' went to sleep straight off .
she 'ad the impudence to ask me for 'ot <unk> . '
'did you give it to her , ' said midmore .
'me ?
your <name> ?
no ! '
the memory of <name> 's outrageous rhyme at the window , and <unk> long nose ( he thought it looked interested at the time ) as he passed the copies of mrs. <unk> 's last four wills , overcame midmore without warning .
'this damp is givin ' you a cold , ' said <name> , rising .
'there you go again !
<unk> 's a sure sign of it .
better go to bed .
you ca n't do any thin ' excep "  she stood rigid , with crossed arms  <unk> me . '
'well .
what about you ? '
midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his pocket .
'now you know about it , what are you goin ' to do  sir ? '
she had the answer on her <name> cheek before the sentence was finished .
'go and see if you can get us something to eat , <name> .
and beer . '
'i <unk> ' the larder 'll be in a swim , ' she replied , 'but old bottled stuff do n't take any harm from wet . '
she returned with a tray , all in order , and they ate and drank together , and took observations of the falling flood till <name> opened its <unk> eyes on the wreck of what had been a fair garden .
midmore , cold and annoyed , found himself humming : 'that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass , that ebb swept out the flocks to sea .
there is n't a rose left , <name> !
an <unk> ebb and flow it was to many more than mine and me .
but each <name> mourn his ...
it 'll cost me a hundred . '
'now we know the worst , ' said <name> , 'we can go to bed .
i 'll lay on the kitchen sofa .
his light 's burnin ' still . '
'and she ? '
<unk> old cat !
you ought to 'ear 'er snore ! '
at ten o'clock in the morning , after a maddening hour in his own garden on the edge of the retreating <name> , midmore went off to confront more damage at <name> 's .
the first thing that met him was the pig , snowy white , for the water had washed him out of his new sty , calling on high heaven for breakfast .
the front door had been forced open , and the flood had registered its own height in a brown <unk> on the walls .
midmore chased the pig out and called up the stairs .
'i be abed o ' course .
which step 'as she rose to ? '
<name> cried from above .
'the fourth ?
then it 's beat all records .
come up . '
'are you ill ? '
midmore asked as he entered the room .
the red eyelids blinked cheerfully .
mr. <name> , beneath a sumptuous <unk> quilt , was smoking .
<unk> !
i 'm only <unk> ' god i ai n't my own landlord .
take that cheer .
what 's she done ? '
'it has n't gone down enough for me to make sure . '
<unk> <unk> o ' yourn 'll be middlin ' far down the <name> by now ; an' your <unk> have gone after 'em .
i saved my chickens , though .
you'd better get mus ' sperrit to take the law o ' <unk> an ' 'is <unk> . '
'no , thanks .
i 've trouble enough without that . '
<unk> ye ? '
mr. <name> grinned .
'how did ye make out with those two women o ' mine last night ?
i lay they fought . '
'you infernal old scoundrel ! '
midmore laughed .
'i be  an ' then again i <unk> n't , ' was the placid answer .
'but , <name> , she would n't <name> ' left me last night .
fire or flood , she would n't . '
'why did n't you ever marry her ? '
midmore asked .
<unk> of good money .
she was willin ' without . '
there was a step on the gritty mud below , and a voice humming .
midmore rose quickly saying : 'well , i suppose you 're all right now . '
'i be .
i ai n't a landlord , nor i ai n't young  nor anxious .
oh , <unk> midmore !
would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin ' regular if i married her ?
<name> said maybe 'twould . '
'did he ? '
midmore turned at the door .
'and what did <name> say about it ? '
<unk> ? '
mr. <name> chuckled as the joke took him .
'oh , he's none o' mine .
he 's <name> 's look-out . '
midmore slammed the door and ran downstairs .
'well , this is a  sweet  mess , ' said miss sperrit in shortest skirts and heaviest <unk> .
'i had to come down and have a look at it .
" the old mayor climbed the belfry tower . "
<unk> up all night nursing your family ? '
<unk> that !
is n't it cheerful ? '
he pointed through the door to the stairs with small <unk> on the last three <unk> .
'it 's a record , though , ' said she , and hummed to herself : 'that flood strewed wrecks upon the grass , that ebb swept out the flocks to sea . '
'you 're always singing that , are n't you ? '
midmore said suddenly as she passed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at all angles .
'am i ?
now i come to think of it i believe i do .
they say i always hum when i ride .
have you noticed it ? '
'of course i have .
i notice every  ' 'oh , ' she went on hurriedly .
'we had it for the village <unk> last <name>  " the brides of enderby . " '
'no !
" high tide on the coast of <unk> . " '
for some reason midmore spoke sharply .
'just like that . '
she pointed to the <unk> walls .
'i say ... . let's get this furniture a little straight ... . you know it too ? '
'every word , since you sang it of course . '
'when ? '
'the first night i ever came down .
you rode past the drawing-room window in the dark singing it  " and sweeter woman  " ' 'i thought the house was empty then .
your aunt always let us use that short cut .
<unk> n't we better get this out into the passage ?
it 'll all have to come out anyhow .
you take the other side . '
they began to lift a <unk> table .
their words came <unk> between gasps and their faces were as white as  a newly washed and very hungry pig .
'look out ! '
midmore shouted .
his legs were whirled from under him , as the table , grunting madly , <unk> and knocked the girl out of sight .
the wild boar of <name> could not have cut down a couple more scientifically , but this little pig lacked his ancestor 's nerve and fled shrieking over their bodies .
'are you hurt , darling ? '
was midmore 's first word , and 'no  i 'm only winded  dear , ' was miss sperrit 's , as he lifted her out of her corner , her hat over one eye and her right cheek a <unk> of mud .
they fed him a little later on some <unk> that they found in <name> 's quiet barn , a pail of <unk> out of the dairy , and a quantity of onions from a shelf in the <unk> .
<unk> , most likely , ' said <name> .
'you 'll hear about this . '
'what does it matter ?
they ought to have been gilded .
we must buy him . '
'and keep him as long as he lives , ' she agreed .
'but i think i ought to go home now .
you see , when i came out i did n't expect ... did you ? '
'no !
yes ... .
it had to come ... .
but if any one had told me an hour ago ! ...
<name> 's unspeakable parlour  and the mud on the carpet . '
'oh , i say !
is my cheek clean now ? '
'not quite .
lend me your <unk> again a minute , darling ... . what a <unk> you came ! '
'you ca n't talk .
'remember when your <name> hit that table and you said " blast " !
i was just going to laugh . '
'you did n't laugh when i picked you up .
you were going " <unk> " like a little owl . '
'my dear child  ' 'say that again ! '
'my dear child .
( do you really like it ?
i keep it for my best friends . )
my <unk> child , i thought i was going to be sick there and then .
he knocked every ounce of wind out of me  the <name> !
but i must really go . '
they set off together , very careful not to join hands or take arms .
'not across the fields , ' said midmore at the stile .
'come round by  by your own place . '
she flushed indignantly .
'it <name> be yours in a little time , ' he went on , shaken with his own audacity .
'not so much of your little times , if you please ! '
she shied like a colt across the road ; then instantly , like a colt , her eyes lit with new curiosity as she came in sight of the <unk> .
'and not quite so much of your airs and graces , madam , ' midmore returned , 'or i wo n't let you use our drive as a short cut any more . '
'oh , i 'll be good .
i 'll be good . '
her voice changed suddenly .
'i swear i 'll try to be good , dear .
i 'm not much of a thing at the best .
what made you ... <unk> 'i 'm worse  worse !
miles and oceans worse .
but what does it matter now ? '
they halted beside the <unk> .
'i see ! '
she said , looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front door porch where <name> was slapping a wet mat to and fro .
'_i see ... . now , i really must go home .
no !
do n't you come .
i must speak to mother first all by myself . '
he watched her up the hill till she was out of sight .
the floods the rain it rains without a stay in the hills above us , in the hills ; and presently the floods break way whose strength is in the hills .
the trees they suck from every cloud , the valley <name> they roar aloud  <unk> for the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the first wood down is sere and small , from the hills , the <unk> off the hills ; and then come by the bats and all we cut last year in the hills ; and then the roots we tried to cleave but found too tough and had to leave  <unk> through the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the eye shall look , the ear shall hark to the hills , the doings in the hills , and rivers <unk> in the dark with tokens from the hills .
now what is weak <name> surely go , and what is strong must prove it so .
stand fast in the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the floods they shall not be afraid  nor the hills above 'em , nor the hills  of any fence which man has made betwixt him and the hills .
the waters shall not reckon twice for any work of man 's device , but bid it down to the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the floods shall sweep corruption clean  by the hills , the blessing of the hills  that more the meadows may be green <unk> from the hills .
the crops and cattle shall increase , nor little children shall not cease  go  plough the lowlands , lowlands , lowlands under the hills !
the <unk> when all the world would have a matter hid , since truth is seldom friend to any crowd , men write in fable , as old <unk> did , jesting at that which none <name> name aloud .
and this they needs must do , or it <name> fall unless they please they are not heard at all .
when desperate folly daily <unk> to work confusion upon all we have , when diligent sloth <unk> freedom 's death , and banded fear <unk> honour 's grave  even in that certain hour before the fall unless men please they are not heard at all .
needs must all please , yet some not all for need needs must all toil , yet some not all for gain , but that men taking pleasure may take heed , whom present toil shall snatch from later pain .
thus some have toiled but their reward was small since , though they pleased , they were not heard at all .
this was the lock that lay upon our lips , this was the yoke that we have undergone , denying us all pleasant <unk> as in our time and generation .
our pleasures <unk> age past recall .
and for our pains  we are not heard at all .
what man hears aught except the groaning guns ?
what man <unk> aught save what each instant brings ?
when each man 's life all <unk> life <unk> , what man shall pleasure in imaginings ?
so it hath fallen , as it was bound to fall , we are not , nor we were not , heard at all .
the vortex ( <name> 1914 ) 'thy lord spoke by inspiration to the <name> . '
<name> koran .
i have , to my grief and loss , suppressed several notable stories of my friend , the hon .
a.m. penfentenyou [ 8 ] , once minister of woods and <unk> in de <unk> 's first administration ; later , premier in all but name of one of our great and growing dominions ; and now , as always , the idol of his own province , which is two and one-half the size of england .
[ footnote 8 : see 'the <unk> , ' actions and reactions . ]
for this reason i hold myself at <name> to deal with some portion of the truth concerning penfentenyou 's latest visit to our shores .
he arrived at my house by car , on a hot summer day , in a white waistcoat and <unk> , sweeping black frock-coat and glistening <unk>  a little rounded , perhaps , at the edges , but agile as ever in mind and body .
'what is the trouble now ? '
i asked , for the last time we had met , penfentenyou was floating a <unk> pound <name> for his beloved but unscrupulous province , and i did not wish to entertain any more of his financial friends .
'we , ' penfentenyou replied <unk> , 'have come to have a voice in your councils .
by the way , the voice is coming down on the evening train with my agent-general .
i thought you would n't mind if i invited 'em .
you know we 're going to share your burdens henceforward .
you'd better get into training . '
'certainly , ' i replied .
'what 's the voice like ? '
'he 's in <name> , ' said penfentenyou .
'he 's got it , and he 's got it bad .
he 'll give it to you , ' he said .
'what 's his name ? '
'we call him all sorts of names , but i think you 'd better call him mr. lingnam .
you wo n't have to do it more than once . '
'what 's he suffering from ? '
'the empire .
he 's pretty nearly cured us all of <unk> at home .
p'raps he 'll cure you . '
'very good .
what am i to do with him ? '
'do n't you worry , ' said penfentenyou .
'he 'll do it . '
and when mr. lingnam appeared half-an-hour later with the agent-general for penfentenyou 's dominion , he did just that .
he advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides .
he said he had been observing to the agent-general that it was both politically immoral and <unk> <unk> that forty-four million people should bear the entire weight of the defences of our mighty empire , but , as he had observed ( here the agent-general evaporated ) , we stood now upon the threshold of a new <name> in which the <unk> and self-respecting ( <unk> ) dominions would rightly and <unk> , as <unk> in <unk> , shoulder their share of any burden which the <unk> council of the future should <unk> .
the agent-general was already arranging for drinks with penfentenyou at the other end of the garden .
mr. lingnam swept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme .
we dined at eight .
at nine mr. lingnam was only drawing abreast of things imperial .
at ten the agent-general , who earns his salary , was shamelessly dozing on the sofa .
at eleven he and penfentenyou went to bed .
at midnight mr. lingnam brought down his <unk> despatch box with the newspaper clippings and set to <unk> the empire in <name> .
i remember that he had three alternative plans .
as a dealer in words , i <unk> for the <unk> third  <unk> <unk> senatorial <unk> '  which he then elaborated in detail for three-quarters of an hour .
at half-past one he urged me to have <name> and to remember that nothing mattered except the idea .
then he retired to his room , accompanied by one glass of cold water , and i went into the <unk> garden and prayed to any power that might be off duty for the blood of mr. lingnam , penfentenyou , and the agent-general .
to me , as i have often observed elsewhere , the hour of earliest <name> is fortunate , and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most comfortable counsellor .
'wait ! '
it said , all among the night 's expectant <unk> .
<unk> is also a day .
wait upon the event ! '
i went to bed so at peace with god and man and guest that when i waked i visited mr. lingnam in pyjamas , and he talked to me <unk> for half-an-hour before his bath .
later , the agent-general said he had letters to write , and penfentenyou invented a cabinet crisis in his adored dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the forenoon .
but i said firmly , 'mr .
lingnam wishes to see a little of the country round here .
you are coming with us in your own car . '
'it 's a hired one , ' penfentenyou objected .
'yes .
paid for by me as a <unk> , ' i replied .
'and yours has a top , and the weather looks <unk> , ' said the agent-general .
<unk> has n't a <unk> .
even our goggles were hired . '
'i 'll lend you goggles , ' i said .
'my car is under repairs . '
the hireling who had looked to be returned to london spat and growled on the drive .
she was an open car , capable of some eighteen miles on the flat , with <unk> <unk> and a perpetual <unk> .
'it wo n't make the least difference , ' sighed the agent-general .
<unk> only raise his voice .
he did it all the way coming down . '
'i say , ' said penfentenyou suspiciously , 'what are you doing all this for ? '
<unk> of the empire , ' i answered , as mr. lingnam tripped up in <unk> and <unk> .
'now , mr. lingnam <name> tell us exactly what he wants to see .
he probably knows more about england than the rest of us put together . '
'i read it up yesterday , ' said mr. lingnam simply .
while we stowed the <unk> ( one can never make too sure with a hired car ) he outlined a very pretty and instructive little day 's run .
'you 'll drive , of course ? '
said penfentenyou to him .
'it 's the only thing you know anything about . '
this astonished me , for your greater <unk> are rarely <unk> , but mr. lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the present and enjoy our conversation .
well settled on the back seat , he did not once lift his eyes to the mellow landscape around him , or throw a word at the life of the english road which to me is one renewed and <unk> orgy of delight .
the <unk> scouts of the automobile association ; their natural enemies , the unjust police ; our natural enemies , the deliberate <unk> cattle , <unk> at all corners , the <unk> <unk> a furlong behind ; <unk> that pulled <unk> , rifle galleries , and swings , and sucked <unk> from wayside ponds in defiance of the <unk> ; <unk> , their <unk> piled high with road metal ; uniformed village nurses , one per seven statute miles , flitting by on their wheels ; <unk> full of pink children <unk> unconcernedly past roaring , brazen <unk> ; the wayside rector with virgins in attendance , their faces screwed up against our dust ; <unk> of every shape charging down at every <name> ; red flags of <unk> ; detachments of <unk> <unk> ; <unk> of flagrant children playing in <unk> , and the wise , educated english dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his <unk> would but cease from trying to save him , passed and <unk> us in sunlit or shaded <unk> .
but mr. lingnam only talked .
he talked  we all sat together behind so that we could not escape him  and he talked above the worn <unk> and a certain maddening swish of one badly patched tire  and he talked of the <unk> of the empire against all conceivable dangers except himself .
yet i was neither brutally rude like penfentenyou , nor <unk> bored like the agent-general .
i remembered a certain <name> <unk> who delighted the <unk> arms on the borders of the new forest with nine '  it should have been ten  <unk> of a single income of two hundred <unk> placing the imaginary person in  but i could not recall the list of towns further than <unk> , <name> , bagdad , and <unk> . '
this last i must have murmured aloud , for the agent-general suddenly became human and went on : <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> islands  ' 'what ? '
growled penfentenyou .
'nothing , ' said the agent-general , squeezing my hand affectionately .
'only we have just found out that we are brothers . '
<unk> , ' said mr. lingnam .
'that 's what i 've been trying to lead up to .
we 're all brothers .
d'you realise that fifteen years ago such a conversation as we 're having would have been unthinkable ?
the empire would n't have been ripe for it .
to go back , even ten years  ' 'i 've got it , ' cried the agent-general .
' " brighton , cincinnati , and <unk> ! "
god bless r.l.s . !
go on , uncle <name> .
i can endure much now . '
mr. lingnam went on like our <unk> , slowly and loudly .
he admitted that a man <unk> with a central idea  and , after all , the only thing that mattered was the idea  might become a bore , but the world 's work , he pointed out , had been done by bores .
so he laid his bones down to that work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the <name> of allah , who alone closes the mouths of his prophets .
and we wasted more than fifty miles of summer 's vivid own england upon him the while .
about two o'clock we topped <unk> rising and looked down on the village of <unk> <name> , which lies just across a single railway line , spanned by a red brick bridge .
the thick , thunderous <name> airs brought us gusts of <name> from a <unk> <unk> in full blast near the pond on the village green .
drums , too , thumped and banners waved and <unk> flashed at the far end of the broad village street .
mr. lingnam asked why .
'nothing imperial , i 'm afraid .
it looks like a <unk> ' <unk>  one of our big mutual benefit societies , ' i explained .
'the idea only needs to be <unk> to imperial scale  ' he began .
'but it means that the pub .
<name> be crowded , ' i went on .
'what 's the matter with lunching by the roadside here ? '
said penfentenyou .
'we 've got the <unk> . '
'have n't you ever heard of <unk> <name> <unk> ? '
i demanded , and be became the administrator at once , saying , '_i see !
lingnam can drive us in and we 'll get some , while <unk> '  this was the hireling chauffeur , whose views on beer we knew not  <unk> out lunch here .
that 'll be better than eating at the pub .
we can take in the <unk> ' <unk> as well , and perhaps i can buy some newspapers at the station . '
'true , ' i answered .
'the railway station is just under that bridge , and we 'll come back and lunch here . '
i indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly <unk> at the head of <unk> rise .
as <unk> got out the <unk> , a detachment of regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road .
'ah ! '
said mr. lingnam , the <unk> roll in his voice .
'all europe is an armed camp , groaning , as i remember i once wrote , under the weight of its accoutrements . '
'oh , hop in and drive , ' cried penfentenyou .
'we want that beer ! '
it made no difference .
mr. lingnam could have <unk> the empire from a tight rope .
he continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled .
'the danger to the younger nations is of being drawn into this vortex of <unk> , ' he went on , dodging the rear of the soldiery .
<unk> past troops , ' i hinted .
'it saves 'em dust .
and we overtake on the right as a rule in england . '
<unk> ! '
mr. lingnam <unk> over .
'that 's another detail which needs to be <unk> throughout the empire .
but to go back to what i was saying .
my idea has always been that the component parts of the empire should take counsel among themselves on the approach of war , so that , after we have decided on the merits of the <unk> <unk> , we can <unk> what part each dominion shall play whenever war is , unfortunately , a possibility . '
we neared the <unk> railway bridge , and the hireling knocked piteously at the grade .
mr. lingnam changed <unk> , and she hoisted herself up to a joyous <unk> !  from the <unk> .
as we topped the arch we saw a <unk> ' band with banners marching down the street .
'that 's all very fine , ' said the agent-general , 'but in real life things have a knack of happening without approaching  ' * * * * * ( some schools of thought hold that time is not ; and that when we attain complete enlightenment we shall behold past , present , and future as one awful whole .
i myself have nearly achieved this . )
* * * * * we dipped over the bridge into the village .
a boy on a bicycle , loaded with four paper <unk> , <unk> towards us , out of an alley on our right .
he bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent , and naturally took his left .
mr. lingnam swerved frantically to the right .
penfentenyou shouted .
the boy looked up , saw the car was like to squeeze him against the bridge wall , flung himself off his machine and across the narrow pavement into the nearest house .
he slammed the door at the precise moment when the car , all brakes set , <unk> the abandoned bicycle , shattering three of the <unk> and jerking the fourth over the <unk> <unk> into mr. lingnam 's arms .
there was a dead stillness , then a hiss like that of escaping steam , and a man who had been running towards us ran the other way .
'why !
i think that those must be bees , ' said mr. lingnam .
they were  four full swarms  and the first living objects which he had remarked upon all day .
some one said , 'oh , god ! '
the agent-general went out over the back of the car , crying resolutely : 'stop the traffic !
stop the traffic , there ! '
penfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a door-bell , so i had both their rugs , which  for i am an <unk>  i threw over my head .
while i was <unk> my trousers into my socks  for i am an <unk> of experience  mr. lingnam picked up the <unk> <unk> and with a single magnificent gesture ( he told us afterwards he thought there was a river beneath ) hurled it over the parapet of the bridge , ere he ran across the road towards the village green .
now , the station platform immediately below was crowded with <unk> and their friends waiting to welcome a delegation from a sister court .
i saw the box burst on the flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward <unk> like shrapnel .
but the result was stimulating rather than <unk> .
all those well-dressed people below shouted like sodom and gomorrah .
then they moved as a unit into the <unk> , the <unk> , and other places , shut doors and windows and <unk> aloud , while the incoming train whistled far down the line .
i <unk> round cross-legged on the back seat , like a <unk> beauty beneath her veil , and saw penfentenyou , his <unk> over his ears , dancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a <unk> woman at an upper window , who only <unk> and shook her head .
a little child , carrying a kitten , came smiling round a corner .
suddenly ( but these things moved me no more than so many yards of <unk> <unk> ) the kitten leaped spitting from her arms , the child burst into tears , penfentenyou , still dancing , snatched her up and tucked her under his coat , the woman 's countenance blanched , the front door opened , penfentenyou and the child pressed through , and i was alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows and calling children home .
a voice cried : 'you 've <unk> 'em !
you 've <unk> 'em !
throw dust on 'em and they 'll settle ! '
i did not <name> to throw dust on any created thing .
i needed both hands for my draperies and two more for my stockings .
besides , the bees were doing me no hurt .
they recognised me as a member of the county <unk> ' association who had paid his annual subscription and was entitled to a free seat at all <unk> exhibitions .
the quiver and the <unk> of the hireling car , or it might have been the <unk> banners and the arrogant big drum , inclined many of them to go up street , and pay court to the advancing <unk> ' band .
so they went , such as had not followed mr. lingnam in his flight toward the green , and i looked out of two <unk> eyes instead of half a one at the approaching musicians , while i listened with both ears to the delayed train 's second whistle down the line beneath me .
the forester 's band no more knew what was coming than do troops under sudden fire .
indeed , there were the same extravagant gestures and <unk> as attend wounds and deaths in war ; the very same uncanny <unk> of speech  for the <unk> was cut off at <unk> , even as a man drops with a syllable on his tongue .
they clawed , they slapped , they fled , leaving behind them a trophy of banners and <unk> <unk> arranged round the big drum .
then that end of the street also shut its windows , and the village , stripped of life , lay round me like a reef at low tide .
though i am , as i have said , an <unk> in good standing , i never realised that there were so many bees in the world .
when they had woven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other , there remained reserves enough to form <unk> and <unk> on all <unk> and <unk> , without diminishing the multitudes in the three oozing <unk> , or drawing on the fourth ( railway ) battalion in charge of the station below .
the prisoners in the <unk> and other places there cried out a great deal ( i argued that they were dying of the heat ) , and at regular intervals the <unk> called and called to a <unk> who was not on duty , and the train whistled as it <name> nearer .
then penfentenyou , <unk> and <unk> politician of the type that <unk> at the price of all the higher emotions , appeared at the window of the house on my right , broken and <unk> with mirth , the woman beside him , and the child in his arms .
i saw his mouth open and shut , he hollowed his hands round it , but the <unk> of the motor and the bees drowned his words .
he pointed dramatically across the street many times and fell back , tears running down his face .
i turned like a hooded <unk> in a heavy <unk> ( not knowing when my trousers would come out of my socks again ) through one hundred and eighty degrees , and in due time bore on the village green .
there was a salmon in the pond , rising short at a cloud of <unk> to the tune of <unk> ; but there was none to <unk> him .
the <unk> were empty , <unk> sat still on their red sticks before white screens , and the <unk> horses of the <unk> revolved <unk> .
all was <name> , green turf , bright water , and this greedy <unk> fish .
when i had identified it by its grey gills and <unk> as lingnam , i prostrated myself before allah in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer .
then i turned to the purple penfentenyou at the window , and wiped my eyes on the rug edge .
he raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the crack : 'did you see him ?
have they got you ?
i can see lots of things from here .
it 's like a <unk> circus ! '
'can you see the station ? '
i replied , nodding toward the right rear <unk> .
he twisted and <unk> sideways , but could not command that beautiful view .
'no !
what 's it like ? '
he cried .
<unk> ! '
i shouted .
the <unk> woman frowned ; so did penfentenyou , and , i think , apologised to her for my language .
'you 're always so extreme , ' he fluted reproachfully .
'you forget that nothing matters except the idea .
besides , they are this <name> 's bees . '
he closed the window , and introduced us through it in dumb show ; but he contrived to give the impression that i was the specimen under glass .
a spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy .
the train had lost <name> at last , and was coming into the station directly beneath me to see what was the matter .
happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all along the compartments , but none answered their songs or greetings .
she halted , and the people began to get out .
then they began to get in again , as their friends in the <unk> advised .
all did not catch the warning , so there was <unk> at the doors , but those whom the bees caught got in first .
still the bees , more bent on their own business than wanton torture , kept to the south end of the platform by the <unk> , and that was why the completely exposed <unk> at the north end of the train did not at first understand the <unk> sealed <unk> when the latter shouted to him many times to 'get on out o ' this . '
'where are you ? '
was the reply .
'and what for ? '
'it do n't matter where i am , an ' you 'll get <unk> in a minute if you do n't shift , ' said the <unk> .
<unk> 'em at parson 's meadow and they can walk up over the fields . '
that <unk> , <unk> idiot , leaning out of the cab , took the <unk> 's orders as an insult to his dignity , and roared at the shut offices : 'you 'll give me <unk> , <name> you ?
look 'ere , i 'm not in the <unk> of  ' his outstretched hand flew to his neck ... . do you know that if you sting an <unk> it is the same as stinging his train ?
she starts with a jerk that nearly <unk> the <unk> , and runs , barking like a dog , till she is out of sight .
nor does she think about spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her .
i had to do all that .
there was a man called <name> , and his wife <name>  a cheery , <unk> couple  who interested me immensely before they battered their way into a small detached building , already densely occupied .
there was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a <unk> umbrella and twirled it dizzily , which was so new a game that i applauded aloud .
when they had thoroughly cleared the ground , the bees set about making comb for publication at the <unk> counter .
presently some bold hearts tiptoed out of the <unk> over the loud gravel with the consciously modest air of men leaving church , climbed the wooden staircase to the bridge , and so reached my level , where the inexhaustible <unk> were still vomiting squadrons and <unk> .
there was little need to bid them descend .
they had wrapped their heads in handkerchiefs , so that they looked like the disappointed dead <unk> back to purgatory .
only one old gentleman , <unk> draped in a banner embroidered <unk> and fortitude , ' ran the gauntlet <unk> , shouting as he passed me , 'it 's night or <unk> , mister . '
they let him in at the white <unk> , the pub .
where i should have bought the beer .
after this the day <unk> .
i fell to reckoning how long a man in a turkish bath , weakened by excessive laughter , could live without food , and specially drink ; and how long a <unk> <name> could hold out under the same conditions .
obviously , since her one practical joke costs her her life , the <name> can have but small sense of humour ; but her fundamentally dismal and <unk> outlook on life impressed me beyond words .
she had paralysed locomotion , wiped out trade , social intercourse , mutual trust , love , friendship , sport , music ( the lonely <unk> had run down at last ) , all that gives substance , colour or <unk> to life , and yet , in the barren desert she had created , was not one whit more near to the evolution of a <unk> order of things .
the heavens were darkened with the swarms ' divided counsels ; the street <unk> with their purposeless sallies .
they clotted on tiles and <unk> , and began <unk> to build a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their <name> was not with them ; then flung off to seek her , or whirled , dishevelled and insane , into another hissing <unk> on the false rumour that she was there .
i scowled upon them with <unk> , and a massy , blue <unk> rose majestically from behind the <unk> of <unk> <name> <unk> , arched over and scowled with me .
then i realised that it was not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies , but the <unk> of the malignant english thunderstorm  the one thing before which even <name> the <name> can not express her silly little self .
'aha !
now you 'll catch it , ' i said , as the herald gusts set the big drum rolling down the street like a <unk> .
up and up yearned the dark cloud , till the first lightning quivered and cut .
<name> cowered .
where she flew , there she fled ; where she was , there she sat still ; and the solid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is finished .
by the time it had soaked to my second rug , penfentenyou appeared at the window , wiping his false mouth on a napkin .
'are you all right ? '
he inquired .
'then that's all right !
mrs. <unk> says that her bees do n't sting in the wet .
you 'd better fetch lingnam over .
he 's got to pay for them and the bicycle . '
i had no words which the <unk> <name> could listen to , but paddled across the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green .
mr. lingnam , scarcely visible through the <unk> downpour , trotted round the edge .
he bore himself nobly , and lied at the mere sight of me .
'is n't this wet ? '
he cried .
'it has drenched me to the skin .
i shall need a change . '
'come along , ' i said .
'i do n't know what you 'll get , but you deserve more . '
penfentenyou , dry , fed , and in command , let us in .
'you , ' he whispered to me , 'are to wait in the <unk> .
mrs. <unk> did n't like the way you talked about her bees .
hsh !
hsh !
she 's a kind-hearted <name> .
she 's a widow , lingnam , but she 's kept his clothes , and as soon as you 've paid for the damage she 'll rent you a suit .
i 've arranged it all ! '
'then tell him he must n't undress in my hall , ' said a voice from the <unk> .
'tell her  ' lingnam began .
'come and look at the pretty suit i 've chosen , ' penfentenyou cooed , as one <unk> a maniac .
i staggered <unk> again , and fell into the car , whose <unk> machinery masked my <unk> and <unk> .
when i raised my forehead from the wheel , i saw that traffic through the village had been resumed , after , as my watch showed , one and one-half hour 's suspension .
there were two <unk> , one <unk> , one doctor 's car , three <unk> , one patent <unk> van , three <unk> , one <unk> , some <unk> , one with a <unk> , and one <unk> <unk> .
it was the allegory of my own imperturbable country , delayed for a short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her business , and i blessed her with tears in my eyes , even though i knew she looked upon me as drunk and incapable .
then troops came over the bridge behind me  a company of dripping wet regulars without any expression .
in their rear , carrying the <unk> , marched the agent-general and <unk> the hired chauffeur .
'i say , ' said the agent-general , nodding at the darkened khaki backs .
'if that's what we 've got to depend on in event of war they 're a broken <name> .
they ran like hares  ran like hares , i tell you . '
'and you ? '
i asked .
'oh , i just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that end .
then i had lunch .
<unk> about the beer , though .
i say  these cushions are <unk> wet ! '
'i 'm sorry , ' i said .
'i have n't had time to turn 'em . '
<unk> there was n't any need to 'ave kept the engine runnin ' all this time , ' said <unk> sternly .
'i 'll 'ave to account for the expenditure of <unk> .
it exceeds the <unk> indicated , you see . '
'i 'm sorry , ' i repeated .
after all , that is the way that <unk> regard most crises .
the <unk> opened and penfentenyou and another came out into the now thinning rain .
'ah !
there you both are !
here 's lingnam , ' he cried .
'he 's got a little wet .
he 's had to change . '
'we saw that .
i was too sore and weak to begin another laugh , but the agent-general crumpled up where he stood .
the late mr. <unk> must have been a man of tremendous personality , which he had impressed on every <name> of his garments .
i was told later that he had died in delirium <unk> , which at once explained the pattern , and the reason why mr. lingnam , writhing inside it , swore so <unk> .
of the deliberate and diffuse <unk> there remained no trace , save the <unk> and two damp whiskers .
we stood on the pavement , before elemental man calling on elemental powers to condemn and <unk> creation .
'well , had n't we better be getting back ? '
said the agent-general .
'look out ! '
i remarked casually .
'those <unk> are full of bees still ! '
'are they ? '
said the livid mr. lingnam , and tilted them over with the late mr. <unk> 's large boots .
<name> rolled out in drenched lumps into the <unk> gutter .
there was a muffled shriek at the window where mrs. <unk> <unk> .
'it 's all right .
i 've paid for them , ' said mr. lingnam .
he dumped out the last <unk> like mould from a <unk> flower-pot .
'what ?
are you going to take 'em home with you ? '
said the agent-general .
'no ! '
he passed a wet hand over his <unk> forehead .
'was n't there a bicycle that was the beginning of this trouble ? '
said he .
'it 's under the <unk> , sir , ' said <unk> promptly .
'i can fish it out from 'ere . '
'not till i 've done with it , please . '
before we could stop him , he had jumped into the car and taken charge .
the hireling leaped into her collar , surged , shrieked ( less loudly than mrs. <unk> at the window ) , and swept on .
that which came out behind her was , as <unk> truly observed , no <unk> .
mr. lingnam swung round the big drum in the market-place and thundered back , shouting : <unk> it alone .
it's my meat ! '
<unk> , 'e means , ' said <unk> after this second <unk> .
'you could n't say now it 'ad ever been one , could you ? '
mrs. <unk> opened the window and spoke .
it appears she had only charged for damage to the bicycle , not for the entire machine which mr. lingnam was ruthlessly <unk> , spoke by spoke , from the highway and <unk> into the slack of the hood .
at last he answered , and i have never seen a man foam at the mouth before .
'if you do n't stop , i shall come into your house  in this car  and drive upstairs and  kill you ! '
she stopped ; he stopped .
<unk> took the wheel , and we got away .
it was time , for the sun shone after the storm , and <name> beneath the tiles and the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her interrupted labours of <unk> .
we warned the village policeman at the far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again .
the proprietor of the <unk> , swings , and <unk> wanted to know from whom , in this world or another , he could recover damages .
mr. lingnam referred him most directly to mrs. <unk> ... . then we went home .
after dinner that evening mr. lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make a few remarks on the <unk> of the empire on the lines of <unk> , offensive operations , backed by the entire effective forces , moral , military , and <unk> , of permanently <unk> communities , the whole brought to bear , without any respect to the merits of any <unk> <unk> , instantaneously , automatically , and remorselessly at the first faint buzz of war .
'the trouble with us , ' said he , 'is that we take such an <unk> long time making sure that we are right that we do n't go ahead when things happen .
for instance , i ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up when i hit that bicycle . '
'but you were in the wrong , lingnam , when you turned to the right , ' i put in .
'i do n't want to hear any more of your damned , detached , <unk> excuses for the other fellow , ' he snapped .
'now you 're beginning to see things , ' said penfentenyou .
'i <name> you wo n't <unk> when the <unk> go down . '
the song of seven cities i was lord of cities very sumptuously builded .
seven roaring cities paid me tribute from afar .
<name> their outposts were  the <unk> of them gilded , and garrisoned with amazons invincible in war .
all the world went softly when it walked before my cities  neither king nor army vexed my peoples at their toil .
never horse nor chariot <unk> or <unk> my cities , never mob nor ruler questioned whence they <name> their spoil .
banded , mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset , singing while they sacked it , they possessed the land at large .
yet when men would <name> them , they resisted , they made onset and pierced the smoke of battle with a <unk> charge !
so they <unk> and <unk> only yesterday , my cities .
to-day there is no <name> or mound of where my cities stood .
for the river rose at midnight and it washed away my cities .
they are <unk> with <unk> and the towns before the flood .
rain on <unk> channels raised the <unk> round them , freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their world from sight , till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward drowned them  drowned my seven cities and their peoples in one night !
low among the alders lie their derelict foundations , the beams wherein they trusted and the <unk> whereon they built  my rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations , dead , destroyed , aborted , and defiled with mud and <unk> !
the daughters of the palace whom they cherished in my cities , my <unk> princesses , and the promise of their may  their <unk> of the <unk>  all have perished in my cities , with the harsh <unk> virgins that can neither love nor play .
i was lord of cities  i <name> build anew my cities , seven , set on rocks , above the wrath of any flood .
nor <name> i rest from search till i have filled anew my cities with peoples <unk> of the dark , enduring blood .
to the sound of trumpets shall their seed restore my cities .
wealthy and <unk> , that once more may i behold all the world go softly when it walks before my cities , and the horses and the chariots fleeing from them as of old !
<unk> and <unk> ( <name> <unk> ) when the first waves of feverish cold stole over frau ebermann she very wisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed .
he <unk> the attack as mild <unk> , prescribed the appropriate remedies , and left her to the care of her one servant in her comfortable berlin flat .
frau ebermann , beneath the thick <unk> , curled up with what <name> she could until the <unk> should begin to act , and <name> should come back from the chemist with the <unk> , the <unk> quinine , the <unk> , and the little tin <unk> .
meantime , every bone in her body ached ; her head throbbed ; her hot , dry hands would not stay the same size for a minute together ; and her body , tucked into the smallest possible compass , shrank from the chill of the <unk> sheets .
of a sudden she noticed that an <unk> cover which should have lain mathematically square with the <unk> top of the radiator behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner <name> over the <unk> steam pipes .
she recalled that she must have rested her poor head against the <unk> while she was taking off her boots .
she tried to get up and set the thing straight , but the radiator at once receded toward the horizon , which , unlike true horizons , slanted diagonally , exactly parallel with the dropped lace edge of the cover .
frau ebermann groaned through sticky lips and lay still .
'certainly , i have a temperature , ' she said .
'certainly , i have a grave temperature .
i should have been warned by that chill after dinner . '
she resolved to shut her <unk> eyes , but opened them in a little while to torture herself with the knowledge of that <unk> thing against the far wall .
then she saw a child  an untidy , <unk> little girl of about ten , who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat .
this proved  frau ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sick  proved that <name> had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist .
frau ebermann had had children of her own , but they were all grown up now , and she had never been a <unk> in any sense .
yet the intruder might be made to serve her scheme of things .
'make  put , ' she muttered thickly , 'that white thing straight on the top of that yellow thing . '
the child paid no attention , but moved about the room , investigating everything that came in her way  the yellow <unk> handles of the chest of drawers , the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy <unk> curtains , and the <unk> enamel , new <name> <unk> on the door .
frau ebermann watched indignantly .
<unk> !
that is bad and rude .
go away ! '
she cried , though it hurt her to raise her voice .
'go away by the road you came ! '
the child passed behind the <unk> , where she could not see her .
<unk> the door as you go .
i <name> speak to <name> , but  first , put that white thing straight . '
she closed her eyes in misery of body and soul .
the outer door clicked , and <name> entered , very penitent that she had stayed so long at the chemist 's .
but it had been difficult to find the proper type of <unk> , and  'where did the child go ? '
moaned frau ebermann  'the child that was here ? '
'there was no child , ' said startled <name> .
'how should any child come in when i shut the door behind me after i go out ?
all the keys of the flats are different . '
'no , no !
you forgot this time .
but my back is aching , and up my legs also .
besides , who knows what it may have fingered and upset ?
look and see . '
'nothing is fingered , nothing is upset , ' <name> replied , as she took the <unk> from its paper box .
'yes , there is .
now i remember all about it .
put  put that white thing , with the open edge  the lace , i mean  quite straight on that  ' she pointed .
<name> , accustomed to her ways , understood and went to it .
'now , is it quite straight ? '
frau ebermann demanded .
<unk> , ' said <name> .
'in fact , in the very centre of the radiator . '
<name> measured the equal margins with her knuckle , as she had been told to do when she first took service .
'and my tortoise-shell hair brushes ? '
frau ebermann could not command her <unk> from where she lay .
<unk> straight , side by side in the big tray , and the comb laid across them .
your watch also in the coralline <unk> .
everything '  she moved round the room to make sure  <unk> is as you have it when you are well . '
frau ebermann sighed with relief .
it seemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler .
'good ! '
said she .
'now warm my <unk> in the kitchen , so it <name> be ready when i have <unk> .
and the towels also .
make the <unk> steam , and put in the <unk> ; that is good for the larynx .
then sit you in the kitchen , and come when i ring .
but , first , my <unk> bottle . '
it was brought and scientifically tucked in .
'what news ? '
said frau ebermann drowsily .
she had not been out that day .
<unk> victory , ' said <name> .
<unk> more prisoners and guns . '
frau ebermann purred , one might almost say grunted , contentedly .
'that is good too , ' she said ; and <name> , after lighting the <unk> , went out .
frau ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the <unk> would begin to work , and all would be well .
to-morrow  no , the day after  she would take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee .
it was rare  every one knew it  that she should be overcome by any ailment .
yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest deviation from daily routine and ritual .
she would tell her friends  she ran over their names one by one  exactly what measures she had taken against the lace cover on the <unk> and in regard to her two tortoise-shell hair brushes and the comb at right angles .
how she had set everything in order  everything in order .
she <unk> further afield as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the <unk> bottle .
if it pleased our dear god to take her to himself , and she was not so young as she had been  there was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue <unk> , for instance  he should find all her belongings fit to meet his eye .
<unk> and garnished ' were the words that shaped themselves in her intent <name> .
<unk> and garnished for  ' no , it was certainly not for the dear lord that she had swept ; she would have her room swept out to-morrow or the day after , and garnished .
her hands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness .
then they shrank , and so did her head , to minute dots .
it occurred to her that she was waiting for some event , some tremendously important event , to come to pass .
she lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands should return to their proper size .
she opened her eyes with a jerk .
'how stupid of me , ' she said aloud , 'to set the room in order for a parcel of dirty little children ! '
they were there  five of them , two little boys and three girls  headed by the <unk> <unk> whom she had seen before .
they must have entered by the outer door , which <name> had neglected to shut behind her when she returned with the <unk> .
she counted them backward and forward as one counts scales  one , two , three , four , five .
they took no notice of her , but <name> about , first on one foot then on the other , like strayed chickens , the smaller ones holding by the larger .
they had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway waiting-room , and their clothes were <unk> dirty .
'go away ! '
cried frau ebermann at last , after she had struggled , it seemed to her , for years to shape the words .
'you called ? '
said <name> at the living-room door .
'no , ' said her mistress .
'did you shut the flat door when you came in ? '
<unk> , ' said <name> .
<unk> , it is made to catch shut of itself . '
'then go away , ' said she , very little above a whisper .
if <name> pretended not to see the children , she would speak to <name> later on .
'and now , ' she said , turning toward them as soon as the door closed .
the smallest of the crowd smiled at her , and shook his head before he buried it in his sister 's skirts .
'why  do n't  you  go  away ? '
she whispered earnestly .
again they took no notice , but , guided by the elder girl , set themselves to climb , boots and all , on to the green plush sofa in front of the radiator .
the little boys had to be pushed , as they could not compass the stretch unaided .
they settled themselves in a row , with small gasps of relief , and pawed the plush approvingly .
'i ask you  i ask you why do you not go away  why do you not go away ? '
frau ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times .
it seemed to her that everything in the world <name> on the answer .
'you know you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited .
not houses and bedrooms , you know . '
'no , ' a solemn little <unk> repeated , 'not houses nor bedrooms , nor <unk> , nor churches , nor all those places .
should n't come in .
it 's rude . '
'yes , he said so , ' the younger girl put in proudly .
'he said it .
he told them only pigs would do that . '
the line nodded and dimpled one to another with little explosive <unk> , such as children use when they tell deeds of great daring against their elders .
'if you know it is wrong , that makes it much worse , ' said frau ebermann .
'oh yes ; much worse , ' they assented cheerfully , till the smallest boy changed his smile to a baby wail of weariness .
'when <name> they come for us ? '
he asked , and the girl at the head of the row hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap .
'he 's tired , ' she explained .
'he is only four .
he only had his first breeches this spring . '
they came almost under his armpits , and were held up by broad linen braces , which , his sorrow diverted for the moment , he patted proudly .
'yes , beautiful , dear , ' said both girls .
'go away ! '
said frau ebermann .
'go home to your father and mother ! '
their faces grew grave at once .
<unk> !
we can't , ' whispered the eldest .
'there is n't anything left . '
'all gone , ' a boy echoed , and he puffed through pursed lips .
'like that , uncle told me .
both cows too . '
'and my own three ducks , ' the boy on the girl 's lap said sleepily .
'so , you see , we came here . '
the elder girl leaned forward a little , caressing the child she rocked .
'i  i do n't understand , ' said frau ebermann 'are you lost , then ?
you must tell our police . '
'oh no ; we are only waiting . '
'but what are you waiting for ? ' 'we are waiting for our people to come for us .
they told us to come here and wait for them .
so we are waiting till they come , ' the eldest girl replied .
'yes .
we are waiting till our people come for us , ' said all the others in chorus .
'but , ' said frau ebermann very patiently  'but now tell me , for i tell you that i am not in the least angry , where do you come from ?
where do you come from ? '
the five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the papers , 'that is silly , ' said frau ebermann .
'the people fired on us , and they were punished .
those places are wiped out , stamped flat . '
'yes , yes , wiped out , stamped flat .
that is why and  i have lost the ribbon off my <unk> , ' said the younger girl .
she looked behind her over the <unk> .
'it is not here , ' said the elder .
'it was lost before .
do n't you remember ? '
'now , if you are lost , you must go and tell our police .
they <name> take care of you and give you food , ' said frau ebermann .
<unk> <name> show you the way there . '
'no , '  this was the <unk> with the smile ,  'we must wait here till our people come for us .
must n't we , sister ? '
'of course .
we wait here till our people come for us .
all the world knows that , ' said the eldest girl .
'yes . '
the boy in her lap had waked again .
'little children , too  as little as henri , and he does n't wear trousers yet .
as little as all that . '
'i do n't understand , ' said frau ebermann , shivering .
in spite of the heat of the room and the damp breath of the <unk> , the <unk> was not doing its duty .
the girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant .
'you see , ' she said , <unk> her statements with her <unk> , <unk> told us to wait here till our people came for us .
so we came .
we wait till our people come for us . '
'that is silly again , ' said frau ebermann .
'it is no good for you to wait here .
do you know what this place is ?
you have been to school ?
it is berlin , the capital of germany . '
'yes , yes , ' they all cried ; <unk> , capital of germany .
we know that .
that is why we came . '
'so , you see , it is no good , ' she said triumphantly , 'because your people can never come for you here . '
'they told us to come here and wait till our people came for us . '
they delivered this as if it were a lesson in school .
then they sat still , their hands orderly folded on their laps , smiling as sweetly as ever .
'go away !
go away ! '
frau ebermann shrieked .
'you called ? '
said <name> , entering .
'no .
go away !
go away ! '
'very good , old cat , ' said the maid under her breath .
'next time you may call , ' and she returned to her friend in the kitchen .
'i ask you  ask you , please to go away , ' frau ebermann pleaded .
'go to my <name> through that door , and she <name> give you cakes and <unk> .
it is not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly . '
'where else shall we go now ? '
the elder girl demanded , turning to her little company .
they fell into discussion .
one preferred the broad street with trees , another the railway station ; but when she suggested an emperor 's palace , they agreed with her .
'we <name> go then , ' she said , and added half apologetically to frau ebermann , 'you see , they are so little they like to meet all the others . '
'what others ? '
said frau ebermann .
'the others  hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the others . '
'that is a lie .
there can not be a hundred even , much less a thousand , ' cried frau ebermann .
'so ? '
said the girl politely .
'yes .
i tell you ; and i have very good information .
i know how it happened .
you should have been more careful .
you should not have run out to see the horses and guns passing .
that is how it is done when our troops pass through .
my son has written me so . '
they had clambered down from the sofa , and gathered round the bed with eager , interested eyes .
<unk> and guns going by  how fine ! '
some one whispered .
'yes , yes ; believe me , that is how the accidents to the children happen .
you must know yourself that it is true .
one runs out to look  ' 'but i never saw any at all , ' a boy cried sorrowfully .
'only one noise i heard .
that was when aunt <unk> 's house fell down . '
'but listen to me .
i am telling you !
one runs out to look , because one is little and can not see well .
so one <unk> between the man 's legs , and then  you know how close those big horses and guns turn the corners  then one 's foot slips and one gets run over .
that 's how it happens .
several times it had happened , but not many times ; certainly not a hundred , perhaps not twenty .
so , you see , you must be all .
tell me now that you are all that there are , and <name> shall give you the cakes . '
<unk> , ' a boy repeated monotonously .
'then we all come here to wait till our people come for us . '
'but now we <name> go away from here .
the poor <name> is tired , ' said the elder girl , plucking his sleeve .
'oh , you hurt , you hurt ! '
he cried , and burst into tears .
'what is that for ? '
said frau ebermann .
'to cry in a room where a poor <name> is sick is very inconsiderate . '
'oh , but look , <name> ! '
said the elder girl .
frau ebermann looked and saw .
<unk> revoir , <name> . '
they made their little smiling bows and <unk> undisturbed by her loud cries .
<unk> revoir ,  <name> .
we <name> wait till our people come for us . '
when <name> at last ran in , she found her mistress on her knees , busily cleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator , because , she explained , it was all spotted with the blood of five children  she was perfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole world  who had gone away for the moment , but were now waiting round the corner , and <name> was to find them and give them cakes to stop the bleeding , while her mistress swept and garnished that our dear lord when he came might find everything as it should be .
<name> <unk> ( <unk> ) of miss <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> wrote that she was <unk> conscientious , tidy , companionable , and <unk> .
i am very sorry to part with her , and shall always be interested in her welfare . '
miss fowler engaged her on this recommendation , and to her surprise , for she had had experience of companions , found that it was true .
miss fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time , but though she needed care she did not exhaust her attendant 's vitality .
on the contrary , she gave out , <unk> and with reminiscences .
her father had been a minor court official in the days when the great exhibition of 1851 had just set its seal on civilisation made perfect .
some of miss <unk> tales , none the less , were not always for the young .
<name> was not young , and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair , she was never shocked .
she listened <unk> to every one ; said at the end , 'how interesting ! '
or 'how shocking ! '
as the case might be , and never again referred to it , for she prided herself on a trained mind , which 'did not dwell on these things . '
she was , too , a treasure at domestic accounts , for which the village tradesmen , with their weekly books , loved her not .
otherwise she had no enemies ; provoked no jealousy even among the plainest ; neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to her ; she supplied the odd place at the rector 's or the doctor 's table at half an hour 's notice ; she was a sort of public aunt to very many small children of the village street , whose parents , while accepting everything , would have been swift to resent what they called <unk> ' ; she served on the village nursing committee as miss fowler 's <unk> when miss fowler was crippled by <unk> <unk> , and came out of six months ' <unk> meetings equally respected by all the <unk> .
and when fate threw miss fowler 's nephew , an unlovely orphan of eleven , on miss fowler 's hands , <name> <unk> stood to her share of the business of education as practised in private and public schools .
she checked printed <unk> , and <unk> bills of extras ; wrote to head and house masters , matrons , nurses and doctors , and grieved or rejoiced over <unk> reports .
young <unk> fowler repaid her in his holidays by calling her <unk> , ' <unk> , ' or <unk> , ' by thumping her between her narrow shoulders , or by chasing her <unk> , round the garden , her large mouth open , her large nose high in air , at a <unk> <unk> very like a camel 's .
later on he filled the house with clamour , argument , and <unk> as to his personal needs , likes and dislikes , and the limitations of 'you women , ' reducing <name> to tears of physical fatigue , or , when he chose to be humorous , of helpless laughter .
at crises , which multiplied as he grew older , she was his <unk> and his <unk> to miss fowler , who had no large sympathy with the young ; a vote in his interest at the councils on his future ; his <unk> , strictly accountable for mislaid boots and garments ; always his butt and his slave .
and when he decided to become a solicitor , and had entered an office in london ; when his greeting had changed from <unk> , <unk> , you old beast , ' to mornin ' , <unk> , ' there came a war which , unlike all wars that <name> could remember , did not stay decently outside england and in the newspapers , but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew .
as she said to miss fowler , it was 'most vexatious . '
it took the <unk> son who was going into business with his elder brother ; it took the colonel 's nephew on the <name> of <unk> in canada ; it took mrs. <name> 's son who , his mother said , was devoted to the ministry ; and , very early indeed , it took wynn fowler , who announced on a <unk> that he had joined the flying corps and wanted a <unk> waistcoat .
'he must go , and he must have the waistcoat , ' said miss fowler .
so <name> got the <unk> needles and wool , while miss fowler told the men of her establishment  two gardeners and an odd man , aged sixty  that those who could join the army had better do so .
the gardeners left .
<unk> , the odd man , stayed on , and was promoted to the gardener 's cottage .
the cook , <unk> to be limited in luxuries , also left , after a spirited scene with miss fowler , and took the housemaid with her .
miss fowler <unk> <name> , <unk> 's <unk> daughter , to the vacant post ; mrs. <unk> to the rank of cook , with occasional cleaning <unk> ; and the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly .
wynn demanded an increase in his allowance .
miss fowler , who always looked facts in the face , said , 'he must have it .
the chances are he wo n't live long to draw it , and if three hundred makes him happy  ' wynn was grateful , and came over , in his <unk> uniform , to say so .
his training centre was not thirty miles away , and his talk was so technical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of machines .
he gave <name> such a chart .
'and you 'd better study it , <unk> , ' he said .
'you 'll be seeing a lot of 'em soon . '
so <name> studied the chart , but when wynn next arrived to swell and exalt himself before his womenfolk , she failed badly in <unk> , and he <unk> her as in the old days .
'you look more or less like a human being , ' he said in his new service voice .
'you must have had a <name> at some time in your past .
what have you done with it ?
where d'you keep it ?
a sheep would know more than you do , <unk> .
you 're lamentable .
you are less use than an empty tin can , you <unk> old <unk> . '
'i suppose that 's how your superior officer talks to you ? '
said miss fowler from her chair .
'but <unk> does n't mind , ' wynn replied .
'do you , <unk> ? '
'why ?
was wynn saying anything ?
i shall get this right next time you come , ' she muttered , and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
in a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to miss fowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath .
her heart and her interest were high in the air with wynn , who had finished <unk> ( whatever that might be ) and had gone on from a <unk> ' to a machine more or less his own .
one morning it circled over their very chimneys , alighted on <unk> 's <name> , almost outside the garden gate , and wynn came in , blue with cold , shouting for food .
he and she <name> miss <unk> <unk> , as they had often done , along the <name> <unk> to look at the <unk> .
<name> observed that 'it smelt very badly . '
<unk> , i believe you think with your nose , ' said wynn .
'i know you do n't with your mind .
now , what type 's that ? '
'i 'll go and get the chart , ' said <name> .
'you 're hopeless !
you have n't the mental capacity of a white mouse , ' he cried , and explained the <unk> and the sockets for <unk> till it was time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more .
'ah ! '
said <name> , as the <unk> thing flared upward .
'wait till our flying corps gets to work !
wynn says it 's much safer than in the trenches . '
'i wonder , ' said miss fowler .
'tell <unk> to come and tow me home again . '
'it 's all downhill .
i can do it , ' said <name> , 'if you put the brake on . '
she laid her <name> self against the <unk> and home they trundled .
'now , be careful you are n't heated and catch a chill , ' said <unk> miss fowler .
'nothing makes me perspire , ' said <name> .
as she bumped the chair under the porch she straightened her long back .
the exertion had given her a colour , and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead .
miss fowler glanced at her .
'what do you ever think of , <name> ? '
she demanded suddenly .
'oh , wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockings  as thick as we can make them . '
'yes .
but i mean the things that women think about .
here you are , more than forty  ' <unk> , ' said truthful <name> .
'well ? '
'well ? '
<name> offered miss fowler her shoulder as usual .
'and you 've been with me ten years now . '
'let 's see , ' said <name> .
<unk> was eleven when he came .
he 's twenty now , and i came two years before that .
it must be eleven . '
<unk> !
and you 've never told me anything that matters in all that while .
looking back , it seems to me that i 've done all the talking . '
'i 'm afraid i 'm not much of a <unk> .
as wynn says , i haven't the mind .
let me take your hat . '
miss fowler , moving stiffly from the hip , stamped her <unk> stick on the tiled hall floor .
<unk> , are n't you anything except a companion ?
would you ever have been anything except a companion ? '
<name> <name> up the garden hat on its proper <name> .
'no , ' she said after consideration .
'i do n't imagine i ever should .
but i 've no imagination , i 'm afraid . '
she fetched miss fowler her <unk> glass of <unk> .
that was the wet december when it rained six inches to the month , and the women went abroad as little as might be .
wynn 's flying chariot visited them several times , and for two mornings ( he had warned her by <unk> ) <name> heard the <unk> of his propellers at <name> .
the second time she ran to the window , and stared at the <unk> sky .
a little blur passed overhead .
she lifted her <name> arms towards it .
that evening at six o'clock there came an announcement in an official envelope that second lieutenant w. fowler had been killed during a trial flight .
death was instantaneous .
she read it and carried it to miss fowler .
'i never expected anything else , ' said miss fowler ; 'but i 'm sorry it happened before he had done anything . '
the room was whirling round <name> <unk> , but she found herself quite steady in the midst of it .
'yes , ' she said .
'it 's a great pity he did n't die in action after he had killed somebody . '
'he was killed instantly .
that 's one comfort , ' miss fowler went on .
'but wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at once  whatever happens to the tanks , ' quoted <name> .
the room was coming to rest now .
she heard miss fowler say impatiently , 'but why ca n't we cry , <name> ? '
and herself replying , 'there 's nothing to cry for .
he has done his duty as much as mrs. <name> 's son did . '
'and when he died , she came and cried all the morning , ' said miss fowler .
'this only makes me feel tired  terribly tired .
<name> you help me to bed , please , <name> ?  and i think i 'd like the <unk> bottle . '
so <name> helped her and sat beside , talking of wynn in his riotous youth .
'i believe , ' said miss fowler suddenly , 'that old people and young people slip from under a stroke like this .
the middle-aged feel it most . '
'i expect that 's true , ' said <name> , rising .
'i 'm going to put away the things in his room now .
shall we wear mourning ? '
'certainly not , ' said miss fowler .
<unk> , of course , at the funeral .
i ca n't go .
you <name> .
i want you to arrange about his being buried here .
what a blessing it did n't happen at salisbury ! '
every one , from the authorities of the flying corps to the rector , was most kind and sympathetic .
<name> found herself for the moment in a world where bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of conveyances to all sorts of places .
and at the funeral two young men in <unk> uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards .
'you 're miss <unk> , are n't you ? '
said one .
<unk> told me about you .
he was a good chap  a first-class fellow  a great loss . '
'great loss ! '
growled his companion .
'we 're all awfully sorry . '
'how high did he fall from ? '
<name> whispered .
<unk> nearly four thousand feet , i should think , did n't he ?
you were up that day , monkey ? '
'all of that , ' the other child replied .
'my bar made three thousand , and i was n't as high as him by a lot . '
'then that's all right , ' said <name> .
'thank you very much . '
they moved away as mrs. <name> flung herself weeping on <name> 's flat chest , under the <unk> , and cried , '_i know how it feels !
i know how it feels ! '
'but both his parents are dead , ' <name> returned , as she <unk> her off .
'perhaps they 've all met by now , ' she added vaguely as she escaped towards the coach .
'i 've thought of that too , ' wailed mrs. <name> ; 'but then he 'll be practically a stranger to them .
quite embarrassing ! '
<name> faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to miss fowler , who , when she described mrs. <name> 's outburst , laughed aloud .
'oh , how wynn would have enjoyed it !
he was always utterly unreliable at funerals .
d'you remember  ' and they talked of him again , each <unk> out the other 's gaps .
'and now , ' said miss fowler , 'we 'll pull up the blinds and we 'll have a general tidy .
that always does us good .
have you seen to wynn 's things ? '
<unk>  since he first came , ' said <name> .
'he was never destructive  even with his toys . '
they faced that neat room .
'it ca n't be natural not to cry , ' <name> said at last .
'i 'm so afraid you 'll have a reaction . '
'as i told you , we old people slip from under the stroke .
it 's you i'm afraid for .
have you cried yet ? '
'i ca n't .
it only makes me angry with the germans . '
'that 's sheer waste of vitality , ' said miss fowler .
'we must live till the war 's finished . '
she opened a full wardrobe .
'now , i 've been thinking things over .
this is my plan .
all his civilian clothes can be given away  belgian refugees , and so on . '
<name> nodded .
<unk> , collars , and gloves ? '
'yes .
we do n't need to keep anything except his cap and belt . '
'they came back yesterday with his flying corps clothes '  <name> pointed to a roll on the little iron bed .
'ah , but keep his service things .
some one may be glad of them later .
do you remember his sizes ? '
'five feet eight and a half ; thirty-six inches round the chest .
but he told me he 's just put on an inch and a half .
i 'll <name> it on a label and tie it on his <unk> . '
'so that disposes of that , ' said miss fowler , tapping the palm of one hand with the ringed third finger of the other .
'what waste it all is !
we 'll get his old school trunk to-morrow and pack his civilian clothes . '
'and the rest ? '
said <name> .
'his books and pictures and the games and the toys  and  and the rest ? '
'my plan is to burn every single thing , ' said miss fowler .
'then we shall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards .
what do you think ? '
'i think that would be much the best , ' said <name> .
'but there 's such a lot of them . '
'we 'll burn them in the <unk> , ' said miss fowler .
this was an <unk> furnace for the consumption of refuse ; a little circular <unk> tower of pierced brick over an iron grating .
miss fowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago , and had had it built at the bottom of the garden .
it suited her tidy soul , for it saved unsightly <unk> , and the ashes lightened the stiff <name> soil .
<name> considered for a moment , saw her way clear , and nodded again .
they spent the evening putting away well-remembered civilian suits , <unk> that <name> had marked , and the regiments of very gaudy socks and ties .
a second trunk was needed , and , after that , a little packing-case , and it was late next day when <unk> and the local carrier lifted them to the cart .
the rector luckily knew of a friend 's son , about five feet eight and a half inches high , to whom a complete flying corps outfit would be most acceptable , and sent his gardener 's son down with a barrow to take delivery of it .
the cap was <name> up in miss fowler 's bedroom , the belt in miss <unk> 's ; for , as miss fowler said , they had no <name> to make <unk> talk of them .
'that disposes of that , ' said miss fowler .
'i 'll leave the rest to you , <name> .
i ca n't run up and down the garden .
you 'd better take the big <unk> and get <name> to help you . '
'i shall take the <unk> and do it myself , ' said <name> , and for once in her life closed her mouth .
miss fowler , in moments of irritation , had called <name> deadly methodical .
she put on her oldest waterproof and <unk> and her <unk> <unk> , for the weather was on the edge of more rain .
she gathered <unk> from the kitchen , a <unk> of coals , and a <unk> of brushwood .
these she wheeled in the barrow down the <unk> paths to the dank little <name> shrubbery where the <unk> stood under the drip of three oaks .
she climbed the wire fence into the rector 's <unk> just behind , and from his tenant 's <name> pulled two large <unk> of good hay , which she spread neatly on the <unk> .
next , journey by journey , passing miss fowler 's white face at the <unk> window each time , she brought down in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> and used <unk> , <unk> , levers , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , unrelated piles of the motor <unk> , the light car , and <unk> of <name> exhibitions ; the remnants of a fleet of <unk> from <unk> <unk> to a <unk> yacht ; a <unk> dressing-gown ; bats from <unk> to twenty-four shillings ; cricket and tennis balls ; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their twisted rails ; a grey and red tin model of a submarine ; a dumb <unk> and cracked records ; <unk> that had to be broken across the knee , like his <unk> , and an <unk> ; photographs of private and public school cricket and football <unk> , and his <unk> .
on the line of march ; <unk> , and <unk> ; some <unk> , and one real silver cup , for boxing <unk> and <name> <unk> ; sheaves of school photographs ; miss fowler 's photograph ; her own which he had borne off in fun and ( good care she took not to ask ! )
had never returned ; a <unk> with a secret drawer ; a load of <unk> , belts , and <unk> , and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic ; a packet of all the letters that miss fowler and she had ever written to him , kept for some absurd reason through all these years ; a <unk> attempt at a diary ; framed pictures of racing motors in full <unk> career , and load upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of <unk> , <unk> , electric batteries , tin soldiers , <unk> outfits , and <unk> puzzles .
miss fowler at the window watched her come and go , and said to herself , <unk> 's an old woman .
i never realised it before . '
after lunch she recommended her to rest .
'i 'm not in the least tired , ' said <name> .
'i 've got it all arranged .
i'm going to the village at two o'clock for some paraffin .
<name> hasn't enough , and the walk <name> do me good . '
she made one last quest round the house before she started , and found that she had overlooked nothing .
it began to mist as soon as she had skirted <unk> 's <name> , where wynn used to descend  it seemed to her that she could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead , but there was nothing to see .
she hoisted her umbrella and <unk> into the blind wet till she had reached the shelter of the empty village .
as she came out of mr. kidd 's shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string <unk> , she met nurse <name> , the village nurse , and fell into talk with her , as usual , about the village children .
they were just parting opposite the <unk> oak , ' when a gun , they fancied , was fired immediately behind the house .
it was followed by a child 's shriek dying into a wail .
<unk> ! '
said nurse <name> promptly , and dashed through the empty bar , followed by <name> .
they found mrs. <unk> , the publican 's wife , who could only gasp and point to the yard , where a little <unk> was sliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles .
nurse <name> snatched up a sheet drying before the fire , ran out , lifted something from the ground , and flung the sheet round it .
the sheet turned <name> and half her uniform too , as she bore the load into the kitchen .
it was little <name> <unk> , aged nine , whom <name> had known since her <unk> days .
'am i hurted bad ? '
<name> asked , and died between nurse <name> 's dripping hands .
the sheet fell aside and for an instant , before she could shut her eyes , <name> saw the ripped and <unk> body .
'it 's a wonder she spoke at all , ' said nurse <name> .
'what in god 's name was it ? '
'a bomb , ' said <name> .
'one o ' the <unk> ? '
'no .
an <unk> .
i thought i heard it on the <name> , but i fancied it was one of ours .
it must have shut off its engines as it came down .
that 's why we did n't notice it . '
'the filthy pigs ! '
said nurse <name> , all white and shaken .
'see the pickle i 'm in !
go and tell dr. <unk> , miss <unk> . '
nurse looked at the mother , who had dropped face down on the floor .
'she 's only in a fit .
turn her over . '
<name> heaved mrs. <unk> right side up , and hurried off for the doctor .
when she told her tale , he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he got her something .
'but i do n't need it , i assure you , ' said she .
'i do n't think it would be wise to tell miss fowler about it , do you ?
her heart is so irritable in this weather . '
dr. <unk> looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag .
'no .
do n't tell anybody till we 're sure , ' he said , and hastened to the <unk> oak , ' while <name> went on with the paraffin .
the village behind her was as quiet as usual , for the news had not yet spread .
she frowned a little to herself , her large nostrils expanded <unk> , and from time to time she muttered a phrase which wynn , who never restrained himself before his womenfolk , had applied to the enemy .
<unk> pagans !
they are bloody pagans .
but , ' she continued , falling back on the teaching that had made her what she was , 'one must n't let one 's mind dwell on these things . '
before she reached the house dr. <unk> , who was also a special constable , overtook her in his car .
'oh , miss <unk> , ' he said , 'i wanted to tell you that that accident at the " <name> oak " was due to <unk> 's stable tumbling down .
it 's been dangerous for a long time .
it ought to have been condemned . '
'i thought i heard an explosion too , ' said <name> .
'you might have been misled by the beams snapping .
i 've been looking at 'em .
they were <unk> through and through .
of course , as they broke , they would make a noise just like a gun . '
'yes ? '
said <name> politely .
'poor little <name> was playing underneath it , ' he went on , still holding her with his eyes , 'and that and the tiles cut her to pieces , you see ? '
'i saw it , ' said <name> , shaking her head .
'i heard it too . '
'well , we can not be sure . '
dr. <unk> changed his tone completely .
'i know both you and nurse <name> ( i 've been speaking to her ) are perfectly trustworthy , and i can rely on you not to say anything  yet at least .
it is no good to stir up people unless  ' 'oh , i never do  anyhow , ' said <name> , and dr. <unk> went on to the county town .
after all , she told herself , it might , just possibly , have been the collapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little <name> .
she was sorry she had even hinted at other things , but nurse <name> was discretion itself .
by the time she reached home the affair seemed increasingly remote by its very monstrosity .
as she came in , miss fowler told her that a couple of <unk> had passed half an hour ago .
'i thought i heard them , ' she replied , 'i 'm going down to the garden now .
i 've got the paraffin . '
'yes , but  what have you got on your boots ?
they 're soaking wet .
change them at once . '
not only did <name> obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper , and put them into the string bag with the bottle .
so , armed with the longest kitchen poker , she left .
'it 's raining again , ' was miss fowler 's last word , 'but  i know you wo n't be happy till that 's disposed of . '
'it wo n't take long .
i 've got everything down there , and i 've put the lid on the <unk> to keep the wet out . '
the shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed her arrangements and sprinkled the <unk> oil .
as she lit the match that would burn her heart to ashes , she heard a groan or a grunt behind the dense portugal laurels .
<unk> ? '
she called impatiently , but <unk> , with his ancient <unk> , in his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the sanctuary .
<unk> , ' she concluded , and threw in the <unk> .
the pyre went up in a roar , and the immediate flame hastened night around her .
'how wynn would have loved this ! '
she thought , stepping back from the blaze .
by its light she saw , half hidden behind a <name> not five paces away , a bareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks .
a broken branch lay across his lap  one booted leg protruding from beneath it .
his head moved ceaselessly from side to side , but his body was as still as the tree 's trunk .
he was dressed  she moved sideways to look more closely  in a uniform something like wynn 's , with a flap buttoned across the chest .
for an instant , she had some idea that it might be one of the young flying men she had met at the funeral .
but their heads were dark and glossy .
this man 's was as pale as a baby 's , and so closely cropped that she could see the disgusting <unk> skin beneath .
his lips moved .
'what do you say ? '
<name> moved towards him and stooped .
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> ! '
he muttered , while his hands picked at the dead wet leaves .
there was no doubt as to his nationality .
it made her so angry that she strode back to the <unk> , though it was still too hot to use the poker there .
wynn 's books seemed to be catching well .
she looked up at the oak behind the man ; several of the light upper and two or three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on the shrubbery path .
on the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings , showed like a <unk> in the light of a <unk> flame .
evidently this person had fallen through the tree .
wynn had told her that it was quite possible for people to fall out of <unk> .
wynn told her too , that trees were useful things to break an aviator 's fall , but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have moved from his queer position .
he seemed helpless except for his horrible rolling head .
on the other hand , she could see a pistol case at his belt  and <name> loathed pistols .
months ago , after reading certain belgian reports together , she and miss fowler had had dealings with one  a huge revolver with <unk> bullets , which latter , wynn said , were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised enemies .
'they 're good enough for us , ' miss fowler had replied .
<unk> <name> how it works . '
and wynn , laughing at the mere possibility of any such need , had led the craven winking <name> into the rector 's disused quarry , and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine .
it lay now in the <unk> drawer of her <unk>  a memento not included in the burning .
wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid .
she slipped up to the house to get it .
when she came through the rain , the eyes in the head were alive with expectation .
the mouth even tried to smile .
but at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like <name> <unk> 's .
a tear trickled from one eye , and the head rolled from shoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something .
<unk> .
tout <unk> , ' it whimpered .
'what do you say ? '
said <name> <unk> , keeping well to one side , though only the head moved .
<unk> , ' it repeated .
<unk> me <unk> .
<name> <unk> !
<unk> ! '
<unk> ! '
said she , bringing all her small <name> to bear with the big pistol .
<unk> haben der <unk> kinder <unk> . '
the head was still .
<name> 's hand dropped .
she had been careful to keep her finger off the trigger for fear of accidents .
after a few <unk> waiting , she returned to the <unk> , where the flames were falling , and <unk> up wynn 's <unk> books with the poker .
again the head groaned for the doctor .
'stop that ! '
said <name> , and stamped her foot .
'stop that , you bloody pagan ! '
the words came quite smoothly and naturally .
they were wynn 's own words , and wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have torn little <name> into those vividly coloured strips and strings .
but this thing <unk> under the <unk> had done that thing .
it was no question of reading horrors out of newspapers to miss fowler .
<name> had seen it with her own eyes on the <unk> oak ' kitchen table .
she must not allow her mind to dwell upon it .
now wynn was dead , and everything connected with him was <unk> and rustling and tinkling under her busy poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash .
the thing beneath the oak would die too .
<name> had seen death more than once .
she came of a family that had a knack of dying under , as she told miss fowler , 'most distressing circumstances . '
she would stay where she was till she was entirely satisfied that it was dead  dead as dear papa in the late <unk> ; aunt <name> in <unk> ; mamma in <unk> ; cousin <name> in ninety-five ; <name> <unk> 's housemaid in <unk> ; <name> <unk> 's sister in nineteen hundred and one ; wynn buried five days ago ; and <name> <unk> still waiting for decent earth to hide her .
as she thought  her <unk> caught up by one faded canine , brows knit and nostrils wide  she wielded the poker with <unk> that <name> the grating at the bottom , and careful <unk> round the <unk> above .
she looked at her <unk> .
it was getting on to half-past four , and the rain was coming down in <name> .
tea would be at five .
if it did not die before that time , she would be soaked and would have to change .
meantime , and this occupied her , wynn 's things were burning well in spite of the hissing wet , though now and again a <unk> with a quite distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass .
the exercise of <unk> had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of her bones .
she hummed  <name> never had a voice  to herself .
she had never believed in all those advanced views  though miss fowler herself leaned a little that way  of woman 's work in the world ; but now she saw there was much to be said for them .
this , for instance , was her work  work which no man , least of all dr. <unk> , would ever have done .
a man , at such a crisis , would be what wynn called a <unk> ' ; would leave everything to fetch help , and would certainly bring it into the house .
now a woman 's business was to make a happy home for  for a husband and children .
failing these  it was not a thing one should allow one 's mind to dwell upon  but  'stop it ! '
<name> cried once more across the shadows .
<unk> , i tell you !
ich haben der <unk> kinder <unk> . '
but it was a fact .
a woman who had missed these things could still be useful  more useful than a man in certain respects .
she thumped like a <unk> through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it .
the rain was <unk> the fire , but she could feel  it was too dark to see  that her work was done .
there was a dull red glow at the bottom of the <unk> , not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half over against the driving wet .
this arranged , she leaned on the poker and waited , while an increasing rapture laid hold on her .
she ceased to think .
she gave herself up to feel .
her long pleasure was broken by a sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life .
she leaned forward and listened , smiling .
there could be no mistake .
she closed her eyes and drank it in .
once it ceased abruptly .
'go on , ' she murmured , half aloud .
'that is n't the end . '
then the end came very distinctly in a lull between two <unk> .
<name> <unk> <name> her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head to foot .
<unk> all right , ' said she contentedly , and went up to the house , where she <unk> the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot bath before tea , and came down looking , as miss fowler said when she saw her lying all relaxed on the other sofa , <unk> handsome ! '
the beginnings it was not part of their blood , it came to them very late with long arrears to make good , when the english began to hate .
they were not easily moved , they were icy willing to wait till every count should be proved , ere the english began to hate .
their voices were even and low , their eyes were level and straight .
there was neither sign nor show , when the english began to hate .
it was not preached to the crowd , it was not taught by the state .
no man spoke it aloud , when the english began to hate .
it was not suddenly bred , it <name> not swiftly abate , through the chill years ahead , when time shall count from the date that the english began to hate .

 <name> <unk> .
it came without warning , at the very hour his hand was outstretched to crumple the <unk> and <unk> combine .
the new york doctors called it overwork , and he lay in a darkened room , one ankle crossed above the other , tongue pressed into palate , wondering whether the next <unk> of prickly fires would drive his soul from all <unk> .
at last they gave judgment .
with care he might in two years return to the arena , but for the present he must go across the water and do no work whatever .
he accepted the terms .
it was <unk> ; but the combine that had shivered beneath his knife gave him all the honours of war : <unk> himself , full of <unk> , came to the steamer and filled the <unk> ' suite of cabins with overwhelming <unk> .
" <unk> , " said <name> <unk> when he saw them .
" fitz is right .
i 'm dead ; only i do n't see why he left out the 'in <unk> ' on the ribbons ! "
" nonsense ! "
his wife answered , and poured him his <unk> .
" you 'll be back before you can think . "
he looked at himself in the mirror , surprised that his face had not been branded by the hells of the past three months .
the noise of the decks worried him , and he lay down , his tongue only a little pressed against his palate .
an hour later he said : " <name> , i feel sorry about taking you away from everything like this .
i  i suppose we 're the two <unk> people on god 's earth to-night . "
said <name> his wife , and kissed him : " is n't it something to you that we 're going together ? "
they drifted about europe for months  sometimes alone , sometimes with chance met gipsies of their own land .
from the north cape to the blue grotto at <unk> they wandered , because the next steamer headed that way , or because some one had set them on the road .
the doctors had warned <name> that <unk> was not to take interest even in other men's interests ; but a familiar sensation at the back of the neck after one hour 's keen talk with a <unk> railway <unk> saved her any trouble .
he nearly wept .
" and i 'm over thirty , " he cried .
" with all i meant to do ! "
" let 's call it a honeymoon , " said <name> .
" d ' you know , in all the six years we 've been married , you 've never told me what you meant to do with your life ? "
" with my life ?
what 's the use ?
it 's finished now . "
<name> looked up quickly from the bay of naples .
" as far as my business goes , i shall have to live on my rents like that architect at san <unk> . "
" you 'll get better if you do n't worry ; and even if it <unk> time , there are worse things than  how much have you ? "
" between four and five million .
but it is n't the money .
you know it is n't .
it 's the principle .
how could you respect me ?
you never did , the first year after we married , till i went to work like the others .
our tradition and <unk> are against it .
we ca n't accept those ideals . "
" well , i suppose i married you for some sort of ideal , " she answered , and they returned to their <unk> hotel .
in england they missed the alien tongues of continental streets that reminded them of their own <unk> cities .
in england all men spoke one tongue , <unk> like american to the ear , but on <unk> unintelligible .
" ah , but you have not seen england , " said a <name> with <unk> hair .
they had met her in vienna , bayreuth , and <name> , and were grateful to find her again at <unk> 's , for she commanded situations , and knew where <unk> are most carefully made up .
" you ought to take an interest in the home of our ancestors as i do . "
" i 've tried for a week , mrs. <unk> , " said <name> , " but i never get any further than <unk> <name> waiters . "
" these men are not the true type , " mrs. shouts went on .
" i know where you should go . "
<unk> pricked up his ears , anxious to run anywhere from the streets on which quick men , something of his kidney , did the business denied to him .
" we hear and we obey , mrs. <unk> , " said <name> , feeling his unrest as he drank the loathed british tea .
mrs. <unk> smiled , and took them in hand .
she wrote widely and telegraphed far on their behalf till , armed with her letter of introduction , she drove them into that wilderness which is reached from an <unk> of a station called charing cross .
they were to go to <unk> 's  the farm of one cloke , in the southern counties  where , she assured them , they would meet the genuine england of <unk> and song .
<unk> they found after some hours , four miles from a station , and , so far as they could , judge in the <unk> darkness , twice as many from a road .
trees , kine , and the outlines of barns showed shadowy about them when they alighted , and mr. and mrs. cloke , at the open door of a deep <unk> kitchen , made them shyly welcome .
they lay in an attic beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling , and , because it rained , a wood fire was made in an iron basket on a brick hearth , and they fell asleep to the chirping of mice and the whimper of flames .
when they woke it was a fair day , full of the noises , of birds , the smell of box lavender , and fried bacon , mixed with an elemental smell they had never met before .
" this , " said <name> , nearly pushing out the thin casement in an attempt to see round the corner , " is  what did the <unk> say to the railway <name> about my trunk  <unk> on the top ? ' "
" no ; 'a little bit of all right . '
i feel farther away from anywhere than i 've ever felt in my life .
we must find out where the telegraph office is . "
" who cares ? "
said <name> , wandering about , <unk> in hand , to admire the illustrated weekly pictures pasted on door and cupboard .
but there was no rest for the alien soul till he had made sure of the telegraph office .
he asked the <unk> ' daughter , laying breakfast , while <name> plunged her face in the lavender bush outside the low window .
" go to the stile <unk> o ' the barn field , " said <name> , " and look across pardons to the next spire .
it 's directly under .
you ca n't miss it  not if you keep to the footpath .
my sister 's the <unk> there .
but you 're in the <unk> radius , sir .
the boy delivers telegrams directly to this door from pardons village . "
" one has to take a good deal on trust in this country , " he murmured .
<name> looked at the close turf , scarred only with last night 's wheels , at two ruts which wound round a <unk> , and at the circle of still orchard about the <unk> house .
" what 's the matter with it ? "
she said .
" telegrams delivered to the vale of <unk> , of course , " and she beckoned in an <unk> hound of engaging manners and no engagements , who answered , at times , to the name of <unk> .
he led them , after breakfast , to the rise behind the house where the stile stood against the <unk> , and , " i wonder what we shall find now , " said <name> , frankly prancing with <name> on the grass .
it was a slope of <unk> fields possessed to their centres by clumps of brambles .
gates were not , and the <unk> , <unk> posts leaned out and in .
a narrow path doubled among the bushes , scores of white tails twinkled before the racing hound , and a hawk rose , whistling shrilly .
" no roads , no nothing ! "
said <name> , her short skirt hooked by briers .
" i thought all england was a garden .
there 's your spire , <name> , across the valley .
how curious ! "
they walked toward it through an all abandoned land .
here they found the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die : there a harsh <unk> surrendered to <unk> thistles ; and here a breadth of rampant <unk> <unk> to be lawful crop .
in the <unk> pastures <unk> of dead stuff caught their feet , and the ground beneath glistened with sweat .
at the bottom of the valley a little <name> had undermined its <unk> , and <unk> in the wreckage .
but there stood great woods on the slopes beyond  old , tall , and brilliant , like <unk> tapestries against the walls of a ruined house .
" all this within a hundred miles of london , " he said .
" looks as if it had had nervous prostration , too . "
the footpath turned the shoulder of a slope , through a thicket of rank rhododendrons , and crossed what had once been a carriage drive , which ended in the shadow of two gigantic <unk> .
" a house ! "
said <name> , in a whisper .
" a colonial house ! "
behind the blue-green of the twin trees rose a <unk> brick georgian pile , with a <unk> <unk> over its pillared door .
the hound had gone off on his own foolish <unk> .
except for some stir it the branches and the flight of four startled magpies ; there was neither life nor sound about the square house , but it looked out of its long windows most <unk> .
" <unk> to meet you , i 'm sure , " said <name> , and <unk> to the ground .
" <name> , this is history i can understand .
we began here . "
she <unk> again .
the <name> <name> twinkled on all the lights .
it was as though an old <name> , wise in three generations ' experience , but for the present sitting out , bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild .
" i must look ! "
<name> tiptoed to a window , and shaded her eyes with her hand .
" oh , this room 's <unk> of <unk>  wool , i suppose !
but i can see a bit of the mantelpiece .
<name> , do come !
is n't that some one ? "
she fell back behind her husband .
the front door opened slowly , to show the hound , his nose white with milk , in charge of an ancient of days clad in a blue linen <unk> curiously gathered on breast and shoulders .
" certainly , " said <name> , half aloud .
" father time himself .
this is where he lives , <name> . "
" we came , " said <name> weakly .
" can we see the house ?
i 'm afraid that's our dog . "
" no , 't is <unk> , " said the old man .
" he 's been , at my <unk> again .
staying at <unk> , be ye ?
come in .
ah !
you <unk> ! "
the hound broke from him , and he tottered after him down the drive .
they entered the hall  just such a high light hall as such a house should own .
a <unk> staircase , wide and shallow and once <unk> , climbed out of it under a long oval window .
on either side delicately moulded doors gave on to <unk> rooms , whose <unk> <unk> were adorned with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in low relief .
" what 's the firm that makes these things ? "
cried <name> , <unk> .
" oh , i forgot !
these must be the originals .
adams , is it ?
i never dreamed of anything like that <unk> fender .
does he mean us to go everywhere ? "
" he 's catching the dog , " said <name> , looking out .
" we do n't count . "
they explored the first or ground floor , delighted as children playing burglars .
" this is like all england , " she said at last .
" wonderful , but no explanation .
you 're expected to know it beforehand .
now , let 's try upstairs . "
the stairs never creaked beneath their feet .
from the broad landing they entered a long , <unk> room lighted by three <unk> windows , which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden , and wooded slopes beyond .
" the drawing-room , of course . "
<name> swam up and down it .
" that mantelpiece  <unk> and eurydice  is the best of them all .
is n't it marvellous ?
why , the room seems furnished with nothing in it !
<unk> that , <name> ? "
" it 's the proportions .
i 've noticed it . "
" i saw a <unk> couch once "  <name> laid her finger to her flushed cheek and considered .
" with , two of them  one on each side  you wouldn't need anything else .
except  there must be one perfect mirror over that mantelpiece . "
" look at that view .
it 's a framed constable , " her husband cried .
" no ; it 's a <unk>  a parody of a <unk> .
but about that couch , <name> .
do n't you think empire might be better than <unk> ?
dull gold against that pale green ?
it 's a pity they do n't make <unk> nowadays . "
" i believe you can get them .
look at that oak wood behind the pines . "
" <unk> you sat and played <unk> stately , at the <unk> , " ' <name> hummed , and , head on one ; side , nodded to where the perfect mirror should <name> : then they found bedrooms with <unk> and <unk> , and steps leading up and down  boxes of rooms , round , square , and octagonal , with enriched ceilings and chased <unk> .
" now about servants .
oh ! "
she had darted up the last stairs to the chequered darkness of the top floor , where loose tiles lay among broken <unk> , and the walls were scrawled with names , sentiments , and hop records .
" they 've been keeping pigeons here , " she cried .
" and you could drive a buggy through the roof anywhere , " said <name> .
" that 's what i say , " the old man cried below them on the stairs .
" not a dry place for my pigeons at all . "
" but why was it allowed to get like this ? "
said <name> .
" tis with housen as teeth , " he replied .
" let 'em go too far , and there's nothing to be done .
time was they was minded to sell her , but none would buy .
she was too far away along from any place .
time was they 'd ha' lived here <unk> , but they took and died . "
" here ? "
<name> moved beneath the light of a hole in the roof .
" <unk>  none dies here excep ' falling off ricks and such .
in london they died . "
he plucked a lock of wool from his blue <unk> .
" they was no staple  neither the <unk> nor the <unk> .
<unk> and brittle all of 'em .
dead they be seventeen year , for i 've been here <unk> twenty-five . "
" who does all the wool belong to downstairs ? "
<name> asked .
" to the estate .
i 'll show you the back parts if ye like .
you 're from <name> , ai n't ye ?
i 've had a son there once myself . "
they followed him down the main stairway .
he paused at the turn and swept one hand toward the wall .
" plenty room , here for your coffin to come down .
seven foot and three men at each end would n't <unk> the paint .
if i die in my bed they 'll 'ave to <unk> me like a <unk> .
't is all luck , dye see ? "
he led them on and on , through a maze of back kitchens , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that melted along covered ways into a farm-house , visibly older than the main building , which again rambled out among barns , <unk> , <unk> , stalls and stables to the dead fields behind .
" somehow , " said <name> , sitting exhausted on an ancient <unk>  " somehow one would n't insult these lovely old things by filling them with hay . "
<name> looked at long stone walls <unk> reaches of <unk> <unk> ; buttresses of mixed flint and bricks ; outside stairs , stone upon arched stone ; curves of thatch where grass <unk> ; <unk> of <unk> tiles , and a huge paved yard populated by two cows and the repentant <unk> .
he had not thought of himself or of the telegraph office for two and a half hours .
" but why , " said <name> , as they went back through the crater of stricken fields ,  " why is one expected to know everything in england ?
why do they never tell ? "
" you mean about the <unk> and the <unk> ? "
he answered .
" yes  and the lawyers and the estate .
who are they ?
i wonder whether those painted floors in the green room were real oak .
do n't you like us exploring things together  better than pompeii ? "
<name> turned once more to look at the view .
" eight hundred acres go with the house  the old man told me .
five farms altogether .
<unk> is one of 'em . "
" i like mrs. cloke .
but what is the old house called ? "
<name> laughed .
" that 's one of the things you 're expected to know .
he never told me . "
the <unk> were more communicative .
that evening and thereafter for a week they gave the <unk> the official history , as one gives it to lodgers , of friars pardon the house and its five farms .
but <name> asked so many questions , and <name> was so humanly interested , that , as confidence in the strangers grew , they launched , with observed and acquired detail , into the lives and deaths and doings of the <unk> and the <unk> and their <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
it was a tale told <unk> by cloke in the barn , or his wife in the dairy , the last chapters reserved for the kitchen o ' nights by the big fire , when the two had been half the day exploring about the house , where old iggulden , of the blue <unk> , <unk> and chuckled to see them .
the motives that swayed the characters were beyond their comprehension ; the fates that shifted them were gods they had never met ; the <unk> mrs. cloke threw on act and incident were more amazing than anything in the record .
therefore the <unk> listened delightedly , and blessed mrs. <unk> .
" but why  why  why  did so-and-so do so-and-so ? "
<name> would demand from her seat by the <unk> ; and mrs. cloke would answer , smoothing her knees , " for the sake of the place . "
" i give it up , " said <name> one night in their own room .
" people don't seem to matter in this country compared to the places they live in .
the way she tells it , friars pardon was a sort of <unk> . "
" poor old thing ! "
they had been walking round the farms as usual before tea .
" no wonder they loved it .
think of the sacrifices they made for it .
<name> <unk> married the younger <unk> to keep it in the family .
the octagonal room with the moulded ceiling next to the big bedroom was hers .
now what did he tell you while he was feeding the pigs ? "
said <name> .
" about the <unk> cousins and the uncle who died in java .
they lived at burnt house  behind high pardons , where that <name> is all blocked up . "
" no ; burnt house is under high pardons wood , before you come to <name> <unk> , " <name> corrected .
" well , old man cloke said  " <name> threw open the door and called down into the kitchen , where the <unk> were covering the fire " mrs. cloke , is n't burnt house under high pardons ? "
" yes , my dear , of course , " the soft voice answered absently .
a cough .
" i beg your pardon , madam .
what was it you said ? "
" never mind .
i prefer it the other way , " <name> laughed , and <name> <unk> the missing chapter as she sat on the bed .
" here to-day an ' gone to-morrow , " said cloke warningly .
" they've paid their first month , but we 've only that mrs. <unk> 's letter for guarantee . "
" none she sent never cheated us yet .
it slipped out before i thought .
she 's a most humane young <name> .
they 'll be going away in a little .
an' you 've talked a lot too , <name> . "
" yes , but the <unk> are all dead .
no one can bring my loose talking home to me .
but why do they stay on and stay on so ? "
in due time <name> and <name> asked each other that question , and put it aside .
they argued that the climate  a <name> blend , unlike the hot and cold <unk> of their native land  suited them , as the thick stillness of the nights certainly suited <name> .
he was saved even the sight of a <unk> road , which , as presumably leading to business , wakes <name> in a man ; and the telegraph office at the village of friars pardon , where they sold picture <unk> and <unk> , was two walking miles across the fields and woods .
for all that touched his past among his fellows , or their remembrance of him , he might have been in another planet ; and <name> , whose life had been very largely spent among <unk> wives of lofty ideals , had no wish to leave this present of god .
the <unk> meals , the <unk> of deliciously empty hours to follow , the <unk> of soft sky under which they walked together and reckoned time only by their hunger or thirst ; the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the miles ; their discoveries , always together , amid the farms  <unk> , <unk> , burnt house , <name> <unk> , and the home farm , where iggulden of the blue <unk> would <unk> them , and they would ransack the old house once more ; the long wet afternoons when , they tucked up their feet on the bedroom 's deep window-sill over against the <unk> , and talked together as never till then had they found time to talk  these things contented her soul , and her body throve .
" have you realized , " she asked one morning , " that we 've been here absolutely alone for the last thirty-four days ? "
" have you counted them ? "
he asked .
" did you like them ? "
she replied .
" i must have .
i did n't think about them .
yes , i have .
six months ago i should have fretted myself sick .
remember at cairo ?
i 've only had two or three bad times .
am i getting better , or is it <unk> decay ? "
" climate , all climate . "
<name> swung her <unk> english boots , as she sat on the stile overlooking friars pardon , behind the <unk> barn .
" one must take hold of things though , " he said , " if it 's only to keep one 's hand in . "
his eyes did not flicker now as they swept the empty fields .
" must n't one ? "
" lay out a <unk> links over <name> <unk> .
i dare say you could hire it . "
" no , i 'm not as english as that  nor as <unk> .
cloke says all the farms here could be made to pay . "
" well , i 'm <name> in the <unk> of franchard . '
i 'm content to be alive and purr .
there 's no hurry . "
" no . "
he smiled .
" all the same , i 'm going to see after my mail . "
" you promised you would n't have any . "
" there 's some business coming through that 's amusing me .
honest .
it does n't get on my nerves at all . "
" want a secretary ? "
" no , thanks , old thing !
is n't that quite english ? "
" too english !
go away . "
but none the less in broad daylight she returned the kiss .
" i 'm off to pardons .
i have n't been to the house for nearly a week . "
" how 've you decided to furnish <name> <unk> 's bedroom ? "
he laughed , for it had come to be a permanent castle in spain between them .
" black chinese furniture and yellow silk <unk> , " she answered , and ran downhill .
she scattered a few cows at a gap with a flourish of a <unk> that iggulden had cut for her a week ago , and singing as she passed under the <unk> , sought the farm-house at the back of friars pardon .
the old man was not to be found , and she knocked at his <unk> door , for she needed him to fill her idle forenoon .
a blue-eyed <unk> , a new friend , and <unk> 's old enemy , crawled out and besought her to enter .
iggulden sat in his chair by the fire , a <unk> between his knees , his head drooped .
though she had never seen death before , her heart , that missed a beat , told her that he was dead .
she did not speak or cry , but stood outside the door , and the dog licked her hand .
when he threw up his nose , she heard herself saying : " do n't howl !
please do n't begin to howl , <name> , or i shall run away ! "
she held her ground while the shadows in the <unk> moved toward noon ; sat after a while on the steps by the door , her arms round the <unk> neck , waiting till some one should come .
she watched the <unk> chimneys of friars pardon slash its roofs with shadow , and the smoke of iggulden 's last lighted fire gradually thin and cease .
against her <name> she fell to wondering how many <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> had been swung round the turn of the broad mall stairs .
then she remembered the old man 's talk of being " <unk> like a <unk> , " and buried her face on <name> 's neck .
at last a horse 's feet <unk> upon flags , rustled in the old grey straw of the <unk> , and she found herself facing the vicar  a figure she had seen at church <unk> impossibilities ( <name> was a <unk> ) in an unnatural voice .
" he 's dead , " she said , without preface .
" old iggulden ?
i was coming for a talk with him . "
the vicar passed in uncovered .
" ah ! "
she heard him say .
" <unk> !
how long have you been here ? "
" since a quarter to eleven . "
she looked at her watch earnestly and saw that her hand did not shake .
" i 'll sit with him now till the doctor comes .
d'you think you could tell him , and  yes , mrs. <unk> in the cottage with the <unk> next the blacksmith 's ?
i 'm afraid this has been rather a shock to you . "
<name> nodded , and fled toward the village .
her body failed her for a moment ; she dropped beneath a hedge , and looked back at the great house .
in some fashion its silence and <unk> steadied her for her errand .
mrs. <unk> , small , <unk> , and dark , was almost as unconcerned as friars pardon .
" yiss , yiss , of course .
dear me !
well , iggulden he had had his day in my father 's time .
<name> , get me my little blue bag , please .
yiss , ma'am .
they come down like <unk> in still weather .
no warnin ' at all .
<name> , my bicycle 's be'ind the <unk> .
i 'll tell dr. <name> , ma'am . "
she trundled off on her wheel like a brown <name> , while <name>  heaven above and earth beneath changed  walked stiffly home , to fall over <name> at his letters , in a muddle of laughter and tears .
" it 's all quite natural for them , " she gasped .
" they come down like <unk> in still weather .
yiss , ma'am . '
no , there was n't anything in the least horrible , only  only  oh , <name> , that poor shiny stick of his between his poor , thin knees !
i could n't have borne it if <name> had howled .
i did n't know the vicar was so  so sensitive .
he said he was afraid it was <unk>  rather a shock .
mrs. <unk> told me to go home , and i wanted to collapse on her floor .
but i did n't disgrace myself .
i  i could n't have left him  could i ? "
" you 're sure you 've took no 'arm ? "
cried mrs. cloke , who had heard the news by <unk> , which is older but swifter than <unk> 's .
" no .
i 'm perfectly well , " <name> protested .
" you lay down till tea-time . "
mrs. cloke patted her shoulder .
" they'll be very pleased , though she 'as 'ad no proper <unk> ' for twenty years . "
" they " came before twilight  a <unk> man in <unk> , and a little <unk> old woman , who <unk> like a wren .
" i 'm his son , " said the man to <name> , among the lavender bushes .
" we 'ad a difference  twenty year back , and did n't speak since .
but i 'm his son all the <unk> , and we thank you for the watching . "
" i 'm only glad i happened to be there , " she answered , and from the bottom of her heart she meant it .
" we heard he spoke a lot o ' you  one time an ' another since you came .
we thank you kindly , " the man added .
" are you the son that was in <name> ? "
she asked .
" yes , ma'am .
on my uncle 's farm , in connecticut .
he was what they call <unk> there . "
" whereabouts in connecticut ? "
asked <name> over her shoulder .
" <unk> holler was the name .
i was there six year with my uncle . "
" how small the world is ! "
<name> cried .
" why , all my mother 's people come from <unk> hollow .
there must be some there still  the <unk> .
did you ever hear of them ? "
" i remember hearing that name , seems to me , " he answered , but his face was blank as the back of a spade .
a little before dusk a woman in grey , striding like a <unk> , and bearing on her arm a long pole , crashed through the orchard calling for food .
<name> , upon whom the <unk> english worked mysteriously , fled to the parlour ; but mrs. cloke came forward beaming .
<name> could not escape .
" we 've only just heard of it ; " said the stranger , turning on her .
" i've been out with the <unk> all day .
it was a splendidly <unk> thing  " " did you  er  kill ? "
said <name> .
she knew from books she could not go far wrong here .
" yes , a dry bitch  seventeen pounds , " was the answer .
" a splendidly <unk> ' thing of you to do .
poor old iggulden  " " oh  that ! "
said <name> , enlightened .
" if there had been any people at pardons it would never have happened .
he 'd have been looked after .
but what can you expect from a parcel of london <unk> ? "
mrs. cloke murmured something .
" no .
i 'm soaked from the knees down .
if i <name> about i shall get chilled .
a cup of tea , mrs. cloke , and i can eat one of your sandwiches as i go . "
she wiped her <unk> face with a green and yellow silk handkerchief .
" yes , my <name> ! "
mrs. cloke ran and returned swiftly .
" our land marches with pardons for a mile on the south , " she explained , waving the full cup , " but one has quite enough to do with one 's own people without <unk> ' .
still , if i 'd known , i 'd have sent <name> , of course .
have you seen her this afternoon , mrs. cloke ?
no ?
i wonder whether that girl did sprain her ankle .
thank you . "
it was a formidable hunk of bread and bacon that mrs. cloke presented .
" as i was sayin ' , pardons is a scandal !
<unk> ' people die like dogs .
there ought to be people there who do their duty .
you 've done yours , though there wasn't the faintest call upon you .
good night .
tell <name> , if she comes , i've gone on . "
she strode away , munching her crust , and <name> reeled breathless into the parlour , to shake the shaking <name> .
" why did you keep catching my eye behind the blind ?
why did n't you come out and do your duty ? "
" because i should have burst .
did you see the mud on its cheek ? "
he said .
" once .
i dare n't look again .
who is she ? "
" god  a local deity then .
anyway , she 's another of the things you're expected to know by instinct . "
mrs. cloke , shocked at their levity , told them that it was <name> conant , wife of sir <name> conant , <unk> , a large landholder in the neighbourhood ; and if not god ; at least his visible providence .
<name> made her talk of that family for an hour .
" laughter , " said <name> afterward in their own room , " is the <name> of the savage .
why could n't you control your emotions ?
it 's all real to her . "
" it 's all real to me .
that 's my trouble , " he answered in an altered tone .
" anyway , it 's real enough to <name> time with .
do n't you think so ? "
" what d'you mean ? "
she asked quickly , though she knew his voice .
" that i 'm better .
i 'm well enough to kick . "
" what at ? "
" this ! "
he waved his hand round the one room .
" i must have something to play with till i 'm fit for work again . "
" ah ! "
she sat on the bed and leaned forward , her hands clasped .
" i wonder if it 's good for you . "
" we 've been better here than anywhere , " he went on slowly .
" one could always sell it again . "
she nodded gravely , but her eyes sparkled .
" the only thing that worries me is what happened this morning .
i want to know how you feel about it .
if it 's on your nerves in the least we can have the old farm at the back of the house pulled down , or perhaps it has spoiled the notion for you ? "
" pull it down ? "
she cried .
" you 've no business faculty .
why , that's where we could live while we 're putting the big house in order .
it's almost under the same roof .
no !
what happened this morning seemed to be more of a  of a leading than anything else .
there ought to be people at pardons .
<name> conant 's quite right . "
" i was thinking more of the woods and the roads .
i could double the value of the place in six months . "
" what do they want for it ? "
she shook her head , and her loosened hair fell <unk> about her cheeks .
" seventy-five thousand dollars .
they 'll take sixty-eight . "
" less than half what we paid for our old yacht when we married .
and we did n't have a good time in her .
you were  " " well , i discovered i was too much of an american to be content to be a <name> man 's son .
you are n't blaming me for that ? "
" oh , no .
only it was a very businesslike honeymoon .
how far are you along with the deal , <name> ? "
" i can mail the deposit on the purchase money to-morrow morning , and we can have the thing completed in a fortnight or three weeks  if you say so . "
" friars pardon  friars pardon ! "
<name> chanted rapturously , her dark gray eyes big with delight .
" all the farms ?
<name> <unk> , burnt house , <unk> , the home farm , and <unk> ?
sure you 've got 'em all ? "
" sure . "
he smiled .
" and the woods ?
high pardons wood , lower pardons , <unk> , <unk> shaw , <name> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and both the oak <unk> ?
sure you 've got 'em all ? "
" every last stick .
why , you know them as well as i do . "
he laughed .
" they say there 's five thousand  a thousand pounds ' worth of lumber  timber they call it  in the <unk> alone . "
" mrs. cloke 's oven must be mended first thing , and the kitchen roof .
i think i 'll have all this whitewashed , " <name> broke in , pointing to the ceiling .
" the whole place is a scandal .
<name> conant is quite right .
<name> , when did you begin to fall in love with the house ?
in the <unk> that first day ?
i did . "
" i 'm not in love with it .
one must do something to <name> time till one's fit for work . "
" or when we stood under the oaks , and the door opened ?
oh !
ought i to go to poor iggulden 's funeral ? "
she sighed with utter happiness .
" would n't they call it a <name> now ? "
said he .
" but i liked him . "
" but you did n't own him at the date of his death . "
" that would n't keep me away .
only , they made such a fuss about the watching "  she caught her breath  " it might be ostentatious from that point of view , too .
oh , <name> "  she reached for his hand  " we 're two little orphans moving in worlds not realized , and we shall make some bad breaks .
but we 're going to have the time of our lives . "
" we 'll run up to london to-morrow , and see if we can hurry those english law <unk> .
i want to get to work . "
they went .
they suffered many things ere they returned across the fields in a fly one saturday night , nursing a two by <unk> box of deeds and maps  lawful owners of friars pardon and the five decayed farms therewith .
" i do most sincerely 'ope and trust you 'll be 'appy , madam , " mrs. cloke gasped , when she was told the news by the kitchen fire .
" goodness !
it is n't a marriage ! "
<name> exclaimed , a little awed ; for to them the joke , which to an american means work , was only just beginning .
" if it 's took in a proper spirit "  mrs. cloke 's eye turned toward her oven .
" send and have that mended to-morrow , " <name> whispered .
" we could n't 'elp noticing , " said cloke slowly , " from the times you walked there , that you an ' your <name> was drawn to it , but  but i don't know as we ever precisely thought  " his wife 's glance checked him .
" that we were that sort of people , " said <name> .
" we are n't sure of it ourselves yet . "
" perhaps , " said cloke , rubbing his knees , " just for the sake of saying something , perhaps you 'll park it ? "
" what 's that ? "
said <name> .
" turn it all into a fine park like <name> hill "  he jerked a thumb to westward  " that mr. <unk> bought .
it was four farms , and mr. <unk> made a fine park of them , with a herd of <unk> deer . "
" then it would n't be friars pardon , " said <name> .
" would it ? "
" i do n't know as i 've ever heard pardons was ever anything but wheat an' wool .
only some gentlemen say that parks are less trouble than tenants . "
he laughed nervously .
" but the gentry , o ' course , they keep on pretty much as they was used to . "
" i see , " said <name> .
" how did mr. <unk> make his money ? "
" i never rightly heard .
it was pepper an ' spices , or it may <name> ' been gloves .
no .
gloves was sir <name> <unk> at marley end .
spices was mr. <unk> .
he 's a brazilian gentleman  very <unk> like . "
" be sure o ' one thing .
you wo n't 'ave any trouble , " said mrs. cloke , just before they went to bed .
now the news of the purchase was told to mr. and mrs. cloke alone at 8 p.m. of a saturday .
none left the farm till they set out for church next morning .
yet when they reached the church and were about to slip aside into their usual seats , a little beyond the font , where they could see the <unk> tails of the <unk> <unk> and twist at ringing time , they were swept forward irresistibly , a cloke on either flank ( and yet they had not walked with the <unk> ) , upon the <unk> bosom of a <unk> <unk> , who ushered them into a room of a pew at the head of the left aisle , under the pulpit .
" this , " he sighed reproachfully , " is the pardons ' pew , " and shut them in .
they could see little more than the choir boys in the chancel , but to the roots of the hair of their necks they felt the congregation behind mercilessly devouring them by look .
" when the wicked man <unk> away . "
the strong , alien voice of the priest vibrated under the <unk> roof , and a loneliness <unk> before swamped their hearts , as they searched for places in the unfamiliar church of england service .
the lord 's prayer " our father , which <name> "  set the seal on that desolation .
<name> found herself thinking how in other lands their purchase would long ere this have been discussed from every point of view in a dozen prints , forgetting that <name> for months had not been allowed to glance at those black and bellowing <unk> .
here was nothing but silence  not even hostility !
the game was up to them ; the other players hid their cards and waited .
suspense , she felt , was in the air , and when her sight cleared , saw , indeed , a <unk> tablet of a <unk> bird brooding upon the <unk> motto , " <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . "
at the litany <name> had trouble with an unstable <unk> , and <name> the slip of carpet under the <unk> .
<name> pushed her end back also , and shut her eyes against a burning that felt like tears .
when she opened them she was looking at her mother 's maiden name , fairly carved on a blue <unk> on the pew floor : <name> <unk> .
ob .
<unk> <unk> 27 .
she nudged <name> and pointed .
sheltered , as they kneeled , they looked for more knowledge , but the rest of the slab was blank .
" ever hear of her ? "
he whispered .
" never knew any of us came from here . "
" coincidence ? "
" perhaps .
but it makes me feel better , " and she smiled and winked away a tear on her lashes , and took his hand while they prayed for " all women labouring of child "  not " in the perils of <unk> " ; and the sparrows who had found their way through the guards behind the glass windows <unk> above the faded gilt and <unk> family tree of the <unk> .
the <unk> 's pew was on the right of the aisle .
after service its inhabitants moved forth without haste , but so as to block effectively a dusky person with a large family who <unk> in their rear .
" spices , i think , " said <name> , deeply delighted as the <unk> closed up after the <unk> .
" let 'em get away , <name> . "
but when they came out many folk whose eyes were one still lingered by the <unk> .
" i want to see if any more <unk> are buried here , " said <name> .
" not now .
this seems to be show day .
come home quickly , " he replied .
a group of families , the <unk> a little apart , opened to let them through .
the men saluted with <unk> nods , the women with remnants of a curtsey .
only iggulden 's son , his mother on his arm , lifted his hat as <name> passed .
" your people , " said the clear voice of <name> conant in her ear .
" i suppose so , " said <name> , blushing , for they were within two yards of her ; but it was not a question .
" then that child looks as if it were coming down with mumps .
you ought to tell the mother she should n't have brought it to church . "
" i ca n't leave 'er behind , my <name> , " the woman said .
" she 'd set the 'ouse afire in a minute , she 's that forward with the matches .
ai n't you , <name> dear ? "
" has dr. <name> seen her ? "
" not yet , my <name> . "
" he must .
you ca n't get away , of course .
<unk> !
my idiotic maid is coming in for her teeth to-morrow at twelve .
she shall pick her up  at <name> <unk> , is n't it ?  at eleven . "
" yes .
thank you very much , my <name> . "
" i ought n't to have done it , " said <name> conant apologetically , " but there has been no one at pardons for so long that you 'll forgive my <unk> .
now , ca n't you lunch with us ?
the vicar usually comes too .
i do n't use the horses on a <name> "  she glanced at the <unk> <unk> chariot .
" it 's only a mile across the fields . "
" you  you 're very kind , " said <name> , hating herself because her lip trembled .
" my dear , " the compelling tone dropped to a soothing <unk> , " d'you suppose i do n't know how it feels to come to a strange county  country i should say  away from one 's own people ?
when i first left the <unk>  i 'm shropshire , you know  i cried for a day and a night .
but fretting does n't make loneliness any better .
oh , here 's <name> .
she did sprain her leg that day . "
" i 'm as lame as a tree still , " said the tall maiden frankly .
" you ought to go out with the <unk> , mrs. <unk> .
i believe they 're drawing your water next week . "
sir <name> had already led off <name> , and the vicar came up on the other side of <name> .
there was no escaping the swift procession or the leisurely lunch , where talk came and went in <unk> eddies that had the village for their centre .
<name> heard the vicar and sir <name> address her husband lightly as <unk> !
( she also remembered many women known in a previous life who habitually addressed their husbands as mr .
<unk> . )
after lunch <name> conant talked to her <unk> of <unk> as that is achieved in cottages and farm-houses remote from aid , and of the duty thereto of the mistress of pardons .
a gate in a beech hedge , reached across triple lawns , let them out before tea-time into the unkempt south side of their land .
" i want your hand , please , " said <name> as soon as they were safe among the beech <unk> and the lawless <unk> .
" d'you remember the old maid in <unk> and the guitar ' who heard the <unk> swear , and hardly reckoned herself a maiden <name> afterward ?
because i 'm a relative of hers .
<name> conant is  " " did you find out anything about the <unk> ? "
he interrupted .
" i did n't ask .
i 'm going to write to aunt <name> about it first .
oh , <name> conant said something at lunch about their having bought some land from some <unk> a few years ago .
i found it was at the beginning of last century . "
" what did you say ? "
" i said , <unk> , how interesting ! '
like that .
i 'm not going to push myself forward .
i 've been hearing about mr. <unk> 's efforts in that direction .
and you ?
i could n't see you behind the flowers .
was it very deep water , dear ? "
<name> mopped a brow already browned by outdoor exposures .
" oh no  dead easy , " he answered .
" i 've bought friars pardon to prevent sir <name> 's birds <unk> . "
a cock pheasant <unk> through the dry leaves and exploded almost under their feet .
<name> jumped .
" that 's one of 'em , " said <name> calmly .
" well , your nerves are better , at any rate , " said she .
" did you tell 'em you 'd bought the thing to play with ? "
" no .
that was where my nerve broke down .
i only made one bad break  i think .
i said i could n't see why hiring land to men to farm was n't as much a business proposition as anything else . "
" and what did they say ? "
" they smiled .
i shall know what that smile means some day .
they don't waste their smiles .
d'you see that track by <name> <unk> ? "
they looked down from the edge of the <unk> over a <unk> hollow .
people by twos and threes in their <name> best filed slowly along the paths that connected farm to farm .
" i 've never seen so many on our land before , " said <name> .
" why is it ? "
" to show us we must n't shut up their rights of way . "
" those <unk> we 've been using cross lots ? "
said <name> forcibly .
" yes .
any one of 'em would cost us two thousand pounds each in legal expenses to close . "
" but we do n't want to , " she said .
" the whole community would fight if we did . "
" but it 's our land .
we can do what we like . "
" it 's not our land .
we 've only paid for it .
we belong to it , and it belongs to the people  our people they call 'em .
i 've been to lunch with the english too . "
they passed slowly from one <unk> field to the next  flushed with pride of ownership , plotting alterations and <unk> at each turn ; halting in their tracks to argue , spreading apart to embrace two views at once , or closing in to consider one .
couples moved out of their way , but smiling covertly .
" we shall make some bad breaks , " he said at last .
" together , though .
you wo n't let anyone else in , <name> you ? "
" except the contractors .
this syndicate handles , this proposition by its little lone . "
" but you might feel the want of some one , " she insisted .
" i shall  but it <name> be you .
it 's business , <name> , but it 's going to be good fun . "
" please god , " she answered flushing , and cried to herself as they went back to tea .
" it 's worth it .
oh , it 's worth it . "
the repairing and moving into friars pardon was business of the most varied and searching , but all done english fashion , without friction .
time and money alone were asked .
the rest lay in the hands of beneficent advisers from london , or spirits , male and female , called up by mr. and mrs. cloke from the wastes of the farms .
in the centre stood <name> and <name> , a little aghast , their interests reaching out on every side .
" i ai n't sayin ' anything against <unk> , " said cloke , <unk> clerk of the outer works , consulting engineer , head of the immigration bureau , and superintendent of woods and forests ; " but your own people wo n't go about to make more than a fair profit out of you . "
" how is one to know ? "
said <name> .
" five years from now , or so on , maybe , you 'll be lookin ' over your first year 's accounts , and , knowin ' what you 'll know then , you 'll say : 'well , <name> <unk> '  or old cloke as it might be  'did me proper when i was new . '
no man likes to have that sort of thing laid up against him . "
" i think i see , " said <name> .
" but five years is a long time to look ahead . "
" i doubt if that oak <name> <unk> throwed in <name> 's <unk> <name> be fit for her <unk> floor in less than seven , " cloke drawled .
" yes , that 's my work , " said <name> .
( <name> <unk> of <unk> , a woodman by training and birth , a tenant farmer by misfortune of marriage , had laid his broad axe at her feet a month before . )
" sorry if i 've committed you to another eternity . "
" and we <name> n't even know where we 've gone wrong with your new carriage drive before that time either , " said cloke , ever anxious to keep the balance true with an ounce or two in <name> 's favour .
the past four months had taught <name> better than to reply .
the carriage road winding up the hill was his present keen interest .
they set off to look at it , and the imported american <unk> which had blighted the none too <name> soul of " skim " <unk> , the <name> .
but young iggulden was in charge now , and under his guidance , <unk> and roberts , the great horses , moved mountains .
" you <unk> ' her like that , an ' you tip her like that , " he explained to the gang .
" my uncle he was <unk> in connecticut . "
" are they roads yonder ? "
said skim , sitting under the laurels .
" no better than accommodation roads .
dirt , they call 'em .
they 'd suit you , skim . "
" why ? "
said the <unk> skim .
" cause you 'd take no hurt when you fall out of your cart drunk on a saturday , " was the answer .
" i did n't last time neither , " skim roared .
after the loud laugh , old <unk> of <name> <unk> piped feebly , " well , dirt or no dirt , there 's no <unk> ' <unk> knows a good job when he sees it .
'e do n't build one day and <unk> the next , like that nigger <unk> . "
" she 's the one that knows her own mind , " said <unk> , brother to skim <unk> , and a <name> among <unk> who had helped to bring the grand piano across the fields in the autumn rains .
" she had ought to , " said iggulden .
" whoa , <unk> !
she 's a <unk> .
they never was <unk> . "
" oh , you found that ?
has the answer come from your uncle ? "
said skim , doubtful whether so remote a land as <name> had posts .
the others looked at him scornfully .
skim was always a day behind the fair .
iggulden rested from his labours .
" she 's a <unk> right enough .
i started up to write to my uncle  at once  the month after she said her folks came from <unk> holler . "
" where there ai n't any roads ? "
skim interrupted , but none laughed .
" my uncle he married an american woman for his second , and she took it up like a like the coroner .
she 's a <unk> out of the old <unk> place , 'fore they sold to <unk> .
she ai n't no toot hill <unk> , nor any o ' the <unk> lot .
her folk come out of the ground here , neither chalk nor forest , but <unk> .
they sailed over to <name>  i 've got it all writ down by my uncle 's woman  in eighteen hundred an ' nothing .
my uncle says they 're all slow <unk> like . "
" would they be gentry yonder now ? "
skim asked .
" <unk>  there 's no gentry in <name> , no matter how long you 're there .
it 's against their law .
there 's only <name> and poor allowed .
they've been lawyers and such like over yonder for a hundred years but she 's a <unk> for all that . "
" lord !
what 's a hundred years ? "
said <unk> , who had seen <unk> of them .
" an ' they write too , from yonder  my uncle 's woman writes  that you can still tell 'em by <unk> .
their hair 's <unk> still  an ' they throw out when they walk .
he 's <unk> like a gipsy ; but you watch , an' you 'll see 'er throw , out  like a colt . "
" your trace wants taking up . "
<unk> 's large ears had caught the sound of voices , and as the two broke through the laurels the men were hard at work , their eyes on <name> 's feet .
she had been less fortunate in her inquiries than iggulden , for her aunt <name> of <unk> ( a <unk> and <unk> daughter of the revolution to boot ) answered her inquiries with a <unk> discourse on patriotism , the leaflets of a village improvement society , of which she was president , and a demand for an <unk> subscription to a factory girls ' reading circle .
<name> burned it all in the <unk> and eurydice grate , and kept her own counsel .
" what i want to know , " said <name> , when spring was coming , and the gardens needed thought , " is who <name> ever pay me for my labour ?
i 've put in at least half a million dollars ' worth already . "
" sure you 're not taking too much out of yourself ? "
his wife asked .
" oh , no ; i have n't been conscious of myself all <name> . "
he looked at his brown english gaiters and smiled .
" it 's all behind me now .
i believe i could sit down and think of all that  those months before we sailed . "
" do n't  ah , do n't ! "
she cried .
" but i must go back one day .
you do n't want to keep me out of business always  or do you ? "
he ended with a nervous laugh .
<name> sighed as she <name> her own <unk> ( of old iggulden 's cutting ) from the hall rack .
" are n't you <unk> it too ?
you look a little tired , " he said .
" you make me tired .
i 'm going to <unk> to see mrs. cloke about <name> . "
( this was the sister of the <unk> , promoted to be <unk> at pardons . )
" coming ? "
" i 'm due at burnt house to see about the new well .
by the way , there 's a sore throat at <name> <unk>  " " that 's my province .
do n't interfere .
the <unk> children always have sore throats .
they do it for <unk> . "
" keep away from <name> <unk> till i make sure , <name> .
cloke ought to have told me . "
" these people do n't tell .
have n't you learnt that yet ?
but i 'll obey , me lord .
see you later ! "
she set off afoot , for within the three main roads that bounded the blunt triangle of the estate ( even by night one could scarcely hear the carts on them ) , wheels were not used except for farm work .
the <unk> served all other purposes .
and though at first they had planned improvements , they had soon fallen in with the customs of their hidden kingdom , and moved about the <unk> ways by woodland , <unk> , and shaw as freely as the rabbits .
indeed , for the most part <name> walked bareheaded beneath her helmet of chestnut hair ; but she had been plagued of late by vague <unk> , which she explained to mrs. cloke , who asked some questions .
how it came about <name> never knew , but after a while behold mrs. cloke 's arm was about her waist , and her head was on that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door .
" my dear !
my dear ! "
the elder woman almost sobbed .
" an ' d'you mean to tell me you never suspicioned ?
why  why  where was you ever taught anything at all ?
of course it is .
it 's what we 've been only waitin ' for , all of us .
time and again i 've said to <name>  " she checked herself .
" an' now we shall be as we should be . "
" but  but  but  " <name> whimpered .
" an ' to see you <unk> ' your nest so busy  <unk> and books  an ' never thinkin ' of a nursery ! "
" no more i did . "
<name> sat bolt upright , and began to laugh .
" time enough yet . "
the fingers tapped thoughtfully on the broad knee .
" but  they must be <unk> folk over yonder with you !
have you thought to send for your mother ?
she dead ?
my dear , my dear !
never mind !
she 'll be happy where she knows .
't is god 's work .
an ' we was only waitin ' for it , for you 've never failed in your duty yet .
it ain't your way .
what did you say about my <name> 's doings ? "
mrs. cloke 's face hardened as she pressed her <name> on <name> 's forehead .
" if any of your girls thinks to <unk> arbitrary now , i 'll  but they wo n't , my dear .
i 'll see they do their duty too .
be sure you 'll 'ave no trouble . "
when <name> walked back across the fields heaven and earth changed about her as on the day of old iggulden 's death .
for an instant she thought of the wide turn of the staircase , and the new <unk> paint that no coffin corner could scar , but presently , the shadow passed in a pure wonder and bewilderment that made her reel .
she leaned against one of their new gates and looked over their lands for some other stay .
" well , " she said resignedly , half aloud , " we must try to make him feel that he is n't a third in our party , " and turned the corner that looked over friars pardon , giddy , sick , and faint .
of a sudden the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had never seen it before , <unk> , <unk> , ample , prepared by course of generations for all such things .
as it had steadied her when it lay desolate , so now that it had meaning from their few months of life within , it soothed and promised good .
she went alone and quickly into the hall , and kissed either door-post , whispering : " be good to me .
you know !
you 've never failed in your duty yet . "
when the matter was explained to <name> , he would have sailed at once to their own land , but this <name> forbade .
" i do n't want science , " she said .
" i just want to be loved , and there is n't time for that at home .
besides , " she added , looking out of the window , " it would be desertion . "
<name> was forced to soothe himself with linking friars pardon to the telegraph system of great britain by telephone  three-quarters of a mile of poles , put in by <unk> and a few friends .
one of these was a foreigner from the next parish .
said he when the line was being run : " there 's an old <unk> right in our road .
shall us throw her ? "
" toot hill parish folk , neither <name> nor good luck , god help 'em . "
old <unk> shouted the local proverb from three poles down the line .
" we ai n't goin ' to lay any <unk> to <unk> here not till we know where we are yet awhile .
swing round 'er , swing round ! "
to this day , then , that sudden <unk> in the straight line across the upper pasture remains a mystery to <name> and <name> .
nor can they tell why skim <unk> , who came to his cottage under <unk> shaw most musically drunk at <unk> <unk> of every saturday night , as his father had done before him , sang no more at the bottom of the garden steps , where <name> always feared he would break his neck .
the path was undoubtedly an ancient right of way , and at <unk> p.m. on saturdays skim remembered it was his duty to posterity to keep it open  till mrs. cloke spoke to him once .
she spoke likewise to her daughter <name> , sewing maid at pardons , and to <name> 's best new friend , the <unk> imported london <unk> , who taught <name> to trim hats , and found the country <unk> .
but there was no noise  at no time was there any noise  and when <name> walked abroad she met no one in her path unless she had signified a wish that way .
then they appeared to protest that all was well with them and their children , their chickens , their roofs , their water-supply , and their sons in the police or the railway service .
" but do n't you find it dull , dear ? "
said <name> , loyally doing his best not to worry as the months went by .
" i 've been so busy putting my house in order i have n't had time to think , " said she .
" do you ? "
" no  no .
if i could only be sure of you . "
she turned on the green drawing-room 's couch ( it was empire , not <unk> after all ) , and laid aside a list of linen and blankets .
" it has changed everything , has n't it ? "
she whispered .
" oh , lord , yes .
but i still think if we went back to baltimore  " " and missed our first real summer together .
no thank you , me lord . "
" but we 're absolutely alone . "
" is n't that what i 'm doing my best to remedy ?
do n't you worry .
i like it  like it to the marrow of my little bones .
you do n't realize what her house means to a woman .
we thought we were living in it last year , but we had n't begun to .
do n't you rejoice in your study , <name> ? "
" i prefer being here with you . "
he sat down on the floor by the couch and took her hand .
" seven , " she said , as the french clock struck .
" year before last you'd just be coming back from business . "
he winced at the recollection , then laughed .
" business !
i 've been at work ten solid hours to-day . "
" where did you lunch ?
with the <unk> ? "
" no ; at <unk> shaw , sitting on a log , with my feet in a swamp .
but we 've found out where the old spring is , and we 're going to pipe it down to <name> <unk> next year . "
" i 'll come and see to-morrow .
oh , please open the door , dear .
i want to look down the passage .
is n't that corner by the <unk> lovely where the sun strikes in ? "
she looked through <unk> eyes at the vista of <unk> and pale green all steeped in liquid gold .
" there 's a step out of <name> <unk> 's bedroom , " she went on  " and his first step in the world ought to be up .
i should n't wonder if those people had n't put it there on purpose .
<name> , <name> it make any odds to you if he 's a girl ? "
he answered , as he had many times before , that his interest was his wife , not the child .
" then you 're the only person who thinks so . "
she laughed .
" do n't be silly , dear .
it 's expected .
i know .
it 's my duty .
i <name> n't be able to look our people in the face if i fail . "
" what concern is it of theirs , confound 'em ! "
" you 'll see .
luckily the tradition of the house is boys , mrs. cloke says , so i 'm provided for .
shall you ever begin to understand these people ?
i <name> n't . "
" and we bought it for fun  for fun ! "
he groaned .
" and here we are held up for goodness knows how long ! "
" why ?
were you thinking of selling it ? "
he did not answer .
" do you remember the second mrs .
<unk> ? "
she demanded .
this was a bold , brazen little <unk> woman  a widow for choice  who on <name> 's death was <unk> to marry <name> for his wealth and ruin him in a year .
<name> being busy , <name> had invented her some two years after her marriage , and conceived she was alone among wives in so doing .
" you are n't going to bring her up again ? "
he asked anxiously .
" i only want to say that i should hate any one who bought pardons ten times worse than i used to hate the second mrs. <unk> .
think what we've put into it of our two selves . "
" at least a couple of million dollars .
i know i could have made  " he broke off .
" the beasts ! "
she went on .
" they 'd be sure to build a <unk> lodge at the gates , and cut the lawn up for bedding out .
you must leave instructions in your <name> that he 's never to do that , <name> , won't you ? "
he laughed and took her hand again but said nothing till it was time to dress .
then he muttered " what the devil use is a man 's country to him when he ca n't do business in it ? "
friars pardon stood faithful to its tradition .
at the appointed time was born , not that third in their party to whom <name> meant to be so kind , but a <unk> ; in beauty , it was manifest , <unk> eros , as in wisdom <unk> ; an <unk> of delights , a <unk> of <unk> and an interpreter of <name> .
this last <name> did not realise till he met <name> conant striding through <unk> shaw a few days after the event .
" my dear fellow , " she cried , and slapped him heartily on the back , " i ca n't tell you how glad we all are .
oh , she 'll be all right .
( there's never been any trouble over the birth of an heir at pardons . )
now where the <unk> is it ? "
she felt largely in her <unk> and <name> out a small silver mug .
" i sent a note to your wife about it , but my silly ass of a groom forgot to take this .
you can save me a tramp .
give her my love . "
she marched off amid her guard of grave <unk> .
the mug was worn and <unk> : above the twined initials , <unk> , was the crest of a <unk> bird and the motto : " <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . "
" that 's the other end of the riddle , " <name> whispered , when he saw her that evening .
" read her note .
the english write beautiful notes . "
the warmest of <unk> to your little man .
i <name> he <name> appreciate his native land now he has come to it .
though you have said nothing we can not , of course , look on him as a little stranger , and so i am sending him the old <unk> christening mug .
it has been with us since <name> <unk> , your <unk> 's brother  <name> stared at his wife .
" go on , " she twinkled , from the pillows .
 mother 's brother , sold his place to <name> 's family .
we seem to have acquired some of your household gods at that time , but nothing <unk> except the mug and the old cradle , which i found in the <unk> and am having put in order for you .
i <name> little <name>  <unk> , he <name> be too , wo n't he ?  <name> live to see his grandchildren cut their teeth on his mug .
affectionately yours , <name> conant .
<unk>  how quiet you 've kept about it all !
" well , i 'm  " " do n't swear , " said <name> .
" bad for the infant mind . "
" but how in the world did she get at it ?
have you ever said a word about the <unk> ? "
" you know the only time  to young iggulden at <unk>  when iggulden died . "
" your <unk> 's brother !
she 's traced the whole connection  more than your aunt <name> could do .
what does she mean about our keeping quiet ? "
<name> 's eyes sparkled .
" i 've thought that out too .
we 've got back at the english at last .
ca n't you see that she thought that we thought my mother 's being a <unk> was one of those things we 'd expect the english to find out for themselves , and that 's impressed her ? "
she turned the mug in her white hands , and sighed happily .
" <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . '
that 's not a bad motto , <name> .
it 's been worth it . "
" but still i do n't quite see  " " i should n't wonder if they do n't think our coming here was part of a <unk> scheme to be near our ancestors .
they 'd understand that .
and look how they 've accepted us , all of them . "
" are we so undesirable in ourselves ? "
<name> grunted .
" be just , me lord .
that wretched <unk> man has twice our money .
can you see <unk> conant slapping him between the shoulders ?
not by a <unk> !
the poor beast does n't exist ! "
" do you think it 's that then ? "
he looked toward the cot by the fire where the <unk> snorted .
" the minute i get well i shall find out from mrs. cloke what every <unk> gives in <unk> ( that 's nicer than tips ) every time a <unk> is born .
i 've done my duty thus far , but there 's much expected of me . "
entered here mrs. cloke , and <name> <unk> over the cot .
they showed her the mug and her face shone .
" oh , now <name> conant 's sent it , <unk> be all proper , ma'am , wo n't it ?
<unk> ' of course he 'd have to be , but seein ' what he is we was <unk> '  all your people was <unk> '  it 'ud be <unk> ' too , and <unk> just round it out .
a very <unk> mug quite unique , i should imagine .
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> . '
that 's true with the <unk> , i 've heard .
very slow to fill their houses , they are .
most like master <name> wo n't open 'is nursery till he 's thirty . "
" poor lamb ! "
cried <name> .
" but how did you know my folk were <unk> ? "
mrs. cloke thought deeply .
" i 'm sure i ca n't quite say , ma'am , but i've a belief likely that it was something you may have let drop to young iggulden when you was at <unk> .
that may have been what give us an inkling .
an ' so it came out , one thing in the way o ' talk leading to another , and those american people at <unk> holler was very <unk> with news , i 'm told , ma'am . "
" great <name> ! "
said <name> , under his breath .
" and this is the simple peasant ! "
" yiss , " mrs. cloke went on .
" an ' cloke was only <unk> ' this afternoon  your pillow 's slipped my dear , you must n't lie that <unk>  just for the sake o ' sayin ' something , whether you would n't think well now of getting the <unk> farms back , sir .
they do n't rightly round off sir <name> 's estate .
they come <unk> ' across us more .
cloke , 'e 'ud be glad to show you over any day . "
" but sir <name> does n't want to sell , does he ? "
" we can find out from his bailiff , sir , but "  with cold contempt  " i think that trained nurse is just comin ' up from her dinner , so 'm afraid we 'll 'ave to ask you , sir ... now , master <name>  <unk> !
wake a <unk> minute , <unk> ! "
a few months later the three of them were down at the <name> in the <name> <unk> woods to consider the <unk> of a <unk> carried away by spring floods .
<name> <unk> <unk> wanted all the <unk> on god's earth that day to eat , and  <name> adored him in a voice like to the cooing of a dove ; so business was delayed .
" here 's the place , " said his father at last among the water <unk> .
" but where the deuce are the <unk> , cloke ?
i told you to have them down here ready . "
" we 'll get 'em down if f you say so , " cloke answered , with a thrust of the <unk> they both knew .
" but i did say so .
what on earth have you brought that <unk> here for ?
we are n't building a railway bridge .
why , in <name> , half-a-dozen <unk> bits would be ample . "
" i do n't know nothin ' about that , " said cloke .
" an ' i 've nothin ' to say against <unk>  if you want to make a <unk> job of it .
i ai n't 'ere to tell you what is n't so , sir ; an ' you can't say i ever come <unk> ' up on you , or tryin ' to lead you further in than you set out  " a year ago <name> would have danced with impatience .
now he scraped a little mud off his old gaiters with his spud , and waited .
" all i say is that you can put up <unk> and make a <unk> job of it ; and by the time the young master 's married it 'll have to be done again .
now , i 've brought down a couple of as sweet <unk> oak timbers as we 've ever <unk> .
you put 'em in an ' it 's off your mind or good an' all .
t'other way  i do n't say it ai n't right , i 'm only just sayin ' what i think  but t'other way , he 'll no sooner be married than we 'll lave it all to do again .
you 've no call to regard my words , but you ca n't get out of that . "
" no , " said <name> after a pause ; " i 've been <unk> that for some time .
make it oak then ; we ca n't get out of it . "
the recall i am the land of their fathers , in me the virtue stays ; i <name> bring back my children , after certain days .
under their feet in the grasses my clinging magic runs .
they shall return as strangers , they shall remain as sons .
over their heads in the branches of their <unk> , ancient trees , i weave an <unk> , and draw them to my knees .
scent of smoke in the evening , smell of rain in the night , the hours , the days and the seasons order their souls aright ; till i make plain the meaning of all my thousand years till i fill their hearts with knowledge , while i fill their eyes with tears .
garm  a hostage one night , a very long time ago , i drove to an indian military cantonment called mian mir to see amateur theatricals .
at the back of the infantry barracks a soldier , his cap over one eye , rushed in front of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber .
as a matter of fact , he was a friend of mine , so i told him to go home before any one caught him ; but he fell under the pole , and i heard voices of a military guard in search of some one .
the driver and i coaxed him into the carriage , drove home swiftly , undressed him and put him to bed , where he waked next morning with a sore headache , very much ashamed .
when his uniform was cleaned and dried , and he had been shaved and washed and made neat , i drove him back to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling , and reported that i had accidentally run over him .
i did not tell this story to my friend 's sergeant , who was a hostile and <unk> person , but to his lieutenant , who did not know us quite so well .
three days later my friend came to call , and at his heels <unk> and fawned one of the finest <unk>  of the old-fashioned breed , two parts bull and one terrier  that i had ever set eyes on .
he was pure white , with a <unk> saddle just behind his neck , and a <name> <name> at the root of his thin <unk> tail .
i had admired him distantly for more than a year ; and vixen , my own <unk> , knew him too , but did not approve .
" 'e 's for you , " said my friend ; but he did not look as though he liked parting with him .
" nonsense !
that dog 's worth more than most men , <name> , " i said .
" 'e 's that and more .
<unk> ! "
the dog rose on his hind legs , and stood upright for a full minute .
" eyes right ! "
he sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right .
at a sign he rose and barked thrice .
then he shook hands with his right paw and bounded lightly to my shoulder .
here he made himself into a necktie , limp and lifeless , hanging down on either side of my neck .
i was told to pick him up and throw him in the air .
he fell with a howl , and held up one leg .
" part o ' the trick , " said his owner .
" you 're going to die now .
dig yourself your little grave an ' shut your little eye . "
still limping , the dog hobbled to the <unk> , dug a hole and lay down in it .
when told that he was cured , he jumped out , wagging his tail , and whining for applause .
he was put through half-a-dozen other tricks , such as showing how he would hold a man safe ( i was that man , and he sat down before me , his teeth bared , ready to spring ) , and how he would stop eating at the word of command .
i had no more than finished praising him when my friend made a gesture that stopped the dog as though he had been shot , took a piece of <unk> <unk> from his helmet , handed it to me and ran away , while the dog looked after him and howled .
i read : sir  i give you the dog because of what you got me out of .
he is the best i know , for i made him myself , and he is as good as a man .
please do not give him too much to eat , and please do not give him back to me , for i 'm not going to take him , if you <name> keep him .
so please do not try to give him back any more .
i have kept his name back , so you can call him anything and he <name> answer , but please do not give him back .
he can kill a man as easy as anything , but please do not give him too much meat .
he knows more than a man .
vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little <unk> to the <unk> despairing cry , and i was annoyed , for i knew that a man who cares for dogs is one thing , but a man who loves one dog is quite another .
dogs are at the best no more than <unk> <unk> , <unk> , foul <unk> , and unclean by the law of <name> and <name> ; but a dog with whom one lives alone for at least six months in the year ; a free thing , tied to you so strictly by love that without you he <name> not stir or exercise ; a patient , temperate , humorous , wise soul , who knows your moods before you know them yourself , is not a dog under any ruling .
i had vixen , who was all my dog to me ; and i felt what my friend must have felt , at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving it in my garden .
however , the dog understood clearly enough that i was his master , and did not follow the soldier .
as soon as he <name> breath i made much of him , and vixen , yelling with jealousy , flew at him .
had she been of his own sex , he might have cheered himself with a fight , but he only looked <unk> when she nipped his deep iron sides , laid his heavy head on my knee , and howled anew .
i meant to dine at the club that night ; but as darkness <name> in , and the dog snuffed through the empty house like a child trying to recover from a fit of sobbing , i felt that i could not leave him to suffer his first evening alone .
so we fed at home , vixen on one side , and the <unk> on the other ; she watching his every mouthful , and saying <unk> what she thought of his table manners , which were much better than hers .
it was vixen 's custom , till the weather grew hot , to sleep in my bed , her head on the pillow like a <name> ; and when morning came i would always find that the little thing had braced her feet against the wall and pushed me to the very edge of the cot .
this night she hurried to bed <unk> , every hair up , one eye on the stranger , who had dropped on a mat in a helpless , hopeless sort of way , all four feet spread out , sighing heavily .
she settled her head on the pillow several times , to show her little airs and graces , and struck up her usual <unk> sing-song before slumber .
the <unk> softly edged toward me .
i put out my hand and he licked it .
instantly my wrist was between <unk> teeth , and her warning <unk> !
said as plainly as speech , that if i took any further notice of the stranger she would bite .
i caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand , shook her severely , and said : " vixen , if you do that again you 'll be put into the verandah .
now , remember ! "
she understood perfectly , but the minute i released her she <unk> my right wrist once more , and waited with her ears back and all her body flattened , ready to bite .
the big dog 's tail thumped the floor in a humble and <unk> way .
i grabbed vixen a second time , lifted her out of bed like a rabbit ( she hated that and yelled ) , and , as i had promised , set her out in the verandah with the bats and the moonlight .
at this she howled .
then she used coarse language  not to me , but to the <unk>  till she coughed with exhaustion .
then she ran round the house trying every door .
then she went off to the stables and barked as though some one were stealing the horses , which was an old trick of hers .
last she returned , and her snuffing yelp said , " i 'll be good !
let me in and i 'll ' be good ! "
she was admitted and flew to her pillow .
when she was quieted i whispered to the other dog , " you can lie on the foot of the bed . "
the bull jumped up at once , and though i felt vixen quiver with rage , she knew better than to protest .
so we slept till the morning , and they had early breakfast with me , bite for bite , till the horse came round and we went for a ride .
i do n't think the bull had ever followed a horse before .
he was wild with excitement , and vixen , as usual , squealed and <unk> and <unk> , and took charge of the procession .
there was one corner of a village near by , which we generally passed with caution , because all the yellow <unk> of the place gathered about it .
they were half-wild , starving beasts , and though utter cowards , yet where nine or ten of them get together they <name> mob and kill and eat an english dog .
i kept a whip with a long lash for them .
that morning they attacked vixen , who , perhaps of design , had moved from beyond my horse 's shadow .
the bull was ploughing along in the dust , fifty yards behind , rolling in his run , and smiling as <unk> <name> .
i heard vixen squeal ; half a dozen of the curs closed in on her ; a white streak came up behind me ; a cloud of dust rose near vixen , and , when it cleared , i saw one tall pariah with his back broken , and the bull <unk> another to earth .
vixen retreated to the protection of my whip , and the bull paddled back smiling more than ever , covered with the blood of his enemies .
that decided me to call him " garin of the bloody breast , " who was a great person in his time , or " garm " for short ; so , leaning forward , i told him what his temporary name would be .
he looked up while i repeated it , and then raced away .
i shouted " garin ! "
he stopped , raced back , and came up to ask my <name> .
then i saw that my soldier friend was right , and that that dog knew and was worth more than a man .
at the end of the ride i gave an order which vixen knew and hated : " go away and get washed ! "
i said .
garin understood some part of it , and vixen interpreted the rest , and the two trotted off together soberly .
when i went to the back verandah vixen had been washed <unk> , and was very proud of herself , but the <unk> would not touch garm on any account unless i stood by .
so i waited while he was being scrubbed , and garm , with the soap <unk> on the top of his broad head , looked at me to make sure that this was what i expected him to endure .
he knew perfectly that the <unk> was only obeying orders .
" another time , " i said to the <unk> , " you <name> wash the great dog with vixen when i send them home . "
" does he know ? "
said the <unk> , who understood the ways of dogs .
" garm , " i said , " another time you <name> be washed with vixen . "
i knew that garm understood .
indeed , next <unk> , when vixen as usual fled under my bed , garm stared at the doubtful <unk> in the verandah , stalked to the place where he had been washed last time , and stood rigid in the tub .
but the long days in my office tried him sorely .
we three would drive off in the morning at half-past eight and come home at six or later .
vixen knowing the routine of it , went to sleep under my table ; but the confinement ate into garm 's soul .
he generally sat on the verandah looking out on the mall ; and well i knew what he expected .
sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to the fort , and garm rolled forth to inspect them ; or an officer in uniform entered into the office , and it was pitiful to see poor garm 's welcome to the cloth  not the man .
he would leap at him , and sniff and bark joyously , then run to the door and back again .
one afternoon i heard him bay with a full throat  a thing i had never heard before  and he disappeared .
when i drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier in white uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end , and the garm that met me was a joyous dog .
this happened twice or thrice a week for a month .
i pretended not to notice , but garm knew and vixen knew .
he would glide <unk> from the office about four o'clock , as though he were only going to look at the scenery , and this he did so quietly that but for vixen i should not have noticed him .
the jealous little dog under the table would give a sniff and a snort , just loud enough to call my attention to the flight .
garm might go out forty times in the day and vixen would never stir , but when he slunk off to see his true master in my garden she told me in her own tongue .
that was the one sign she made to prove that garm did not altogether belong to the family .
they were the best of friends at all times , but , vixen explained that i was never to forget garm did not love me as she loved me .
i never expected it .
the dog was not my dog could never be my dog  and i knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped eight miles a day to see him .
so it seemed to me that the sooner the two were <unk> the better for all .
one afternoon i sent vixen home alone in the dog-cart ( garm had gone before ) , and rode over to cantonments to find another friend of mine , who was an <name> soldier and a great friend of the <unk> master .
i explained the whole case , and wound up with : " and now <name> 's in my garden crying over his dog .
why does n't he take him back ?
they 're both unhappy . "
" unhappy !
there 's no sense in the little man any more .
but 't is his fit . "
" what is his fit ?
he travels fifty miles a week to see the brute , and he pretends not to notice me when he sees me on the road ; and i 'm as unhappy as he is .
make him take the dog back . "
" it 's his penance he 's set himself .
i told him by way of a joke , afther you 'd run over him so convenient that night , whin he was drunk  i said if he was a catholic he 'd do penance .
off he went wid that fit in his little head an ' a dose of fever , an nothin ' would suit but givin ' you the dog as a hostage . "
" hostage for what ?
i do n't want hostages from <name> . "
" for his good behaviour .
he 's keepin ' straight now , the way it 's no pleasure to associate wid him . "
" has he taken the pledge ? "
" if 't was only that i need not care .
ye can take the pledge for three months on an ' off .
he sez he 'll never see the dog again , an ' so <name> you , he 'll keep straight for evermore .
ye know his fits ?
well , this is <name> of them .
how 's the dog takin ' it ? "
" like a man .
he 's the best dog in <name> .
ca n't you make <name> take him back ? "
" i can do no more than i have done .
but ye know his fits .
he 's just doin ' his penance .
what <name> he do when he goes to the hills ?
the doctor 's put him on the list . "
it is the custom in <name> to send a certain number of invalids from each regiment up to stations in the himalayas for the hot weather ; and though the men ought to enjoy the cool and the comfort , they miss the society of the barracks down below , and do their best to come back or to avoid going .
i felt that this move would bring matters to a head , so i left <name> hopefully , though he called after me " he wo n't take the dog , sorr .
you can lay your month 's pay on that .
ye know his fits . "
i never pretended to understand private ortheris ; and so i did the next best thing i left him alone .
that summer the invalids of the regiment to which my friend belonged were ordered off to the hills early , because the doctors thought marching in the cool of the day would do them good .
their route lay south to a place called umballa , a hundred and twenty miles or more .
then they would turn east and march up into the hills to <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
i dined with the officers the night before they left  they were marching at five in the morning .
it was midnight when i drove into my garden , and surprised a white figure flying over the wall .
" that man , " said my butler , " has been here since nine , making talk to that dog .
he is quite mad . "
" i did not tell him to go away because he has been here many times before , and because the <unk> told me that if i told him to go away , that great dog would immediately slay me .
he did not wish to speak to the protector of the poor , and he did not ask for anything to eat or drink . "
" kadir <unk> , " said i , " that was well done , for the dog would surely have killed thee .
but i do not think the white soldier <name> come any more . "
garm slept ill that night and whimpered in his dreams .
once he sprang up with a clear , ringing bark , and i heard him wag his tail till it waked him and the bark died out in a howl .
he had dreamed he was with his master again , and i nearly cried .
it was all <name> 's silly fault .
the first halt which the detachment of invalids made was some miles from their barracks , on the amritsar road , and ten miles distant from my house .
by a mere chance one of the officers drove back for another good dinner at the club ( cooking on the line of march is always bad ) , and there i met him .
he was a particular friend of mine , and i knew that he knew how to love a dog properly .
his pet was a big fat retriever who was going up to the hills for his health , and , though it was still <name> , the round , brown brute puffed and panted in the club verandah as though he would burst .
" it 's amazing , " said the officer , " what excuses these invalids of mine make to get back to barracks .
there 's a man in my company now asked me for leave to go back to cantonments to pay a debt he 'd forgotten .
i was so taken by the idea i let him go , and he jingled off in an ekka as pleased as punch .
ten miles to pay a debt !
wonder what it was really ? "
" if you 'll drive me home i think i can show you , " i said .
so he went over to my house in his dog-cart with the retriever ; and on the way i told him the story of garm .
" i was wondering where that brute had gone to .
he 's the best dog in the regiment , " said my friend .
" i offered the little fellow twenty rupees for him a month ago .
but he 's a hostage , you say , for <name> 's good conduct .
<name> 's one of the best men i have when he chooses . "
" that 's the reason why , " i said .
" a second-rate man would n't have taken things to heart as he has done . "
we drove in quietly at the far end of the garden , and crept round the house .
there was a place close to the wall all grown about with <unk> trees , where i knew garm kept his bones .
even vixen was not allowed to sit near it .
in the full indian moonlight i could see a white uniform bending over the dog .
" good-bye , old man , " we could not help hearing <name> 's voice .
" for <unk> 's sake do n't get bit and go mad by any measly <unk> .
but you can look after yourself , old man .
you do n't get drunk an ' run about <unk> your friends .
you takes your bones an ' you eats your biscuit , an ' you kills your enemy like a gentleman .
i 'm goin ' away  do n't <unk>  i 'm goin' off to <unk> , where i wo n't see you no more . "
i could hear him holding garm 's nose as the dog threw it up to the stars .
" you 'll stay here an ' <unk> , an '  an ' i 'll go away an ' try to <unk> , an ' i do n't know 'ow to leave you .
i do n't know  " " i think this is damn silly , " said the officer , patting his foolish <unk> old retriever .
he called to the private , who leaped to his feet , marched forward , and saluted .
" you here ? "
said the officer , turning away his head .
" yes , sir , but i 'm just goin ' back . "
" i shall be leaving here at eleven in my cart .
you come with me .
i can't have sick men running about fall over the place .
report yourself at eleven , here . "
we did not say much when we went indoors , but the officer muttered and pulled his retriever 's ears .
he was a disgraceful , <unk> <unk> of a dog ; and when he <unk> off to my <unk> to be fed , i had a brilliant idea .
at eleven o'clock that officer 's dog was nowhere to be found , and you never heard such a fuss as his owner made .
he called and shouted and grew angry , and hunted through my garden for half an hour .
then i said : " he 's sure to turn up in the morning .
send a man in by rail , and i'll find the beast and return him . "
" beast ? "
said the officer .
" i value that dog considerably more than i value any man i know .
it 's all very fine for you to talk  your <unk> here . "
so she was  under my feet  and , had she been missing , food and wages would have stopped in my house till her return .
but some people grow fond of dogs not worth a cut of the whip .
my friend had to drive away at last with <name> in the back seat ; and then the <unk> said to me : " what kind of animal is <unk> sahib 's dog ?
look at him ! "
i went to the boy 's hut , and the fat old <unk> was lying on a mat carefully chained up .
he must have heard his master calling for twenty minutes , but had not even attempted to join him .
" he has no face , " said the <unk> scornfully .
" he is a <unk> ( a spaniel ) .
he never tried to get that cloth off his jaws when his master called .
now <unk> would have jumped through the window , and that great dog would have slain me with his <unk> mouth .
it is true that there are many kinds of dogs . "
next evening who should turn up but <name> .
the officer had sent him back fourteen miles by rail with a note begging me to return the retriever if i had found him , and , if i had not , to offer huge rewards .
the last train to camp left at half-past ten , and <name> , stayed till ten talking to garm .
i argued and entreated , and even threatened to shoot the <unk> , but the little man was as firm as a rock , though i gave him a good dinner and talked to him most severely .
garm knew as well as i that this was the last time he could <name> to see his man , and followed <name> like a shadow .
the retriever said nothing , but licked his lips after his meal and <unk> off without so much as saying " thank you " to the disgusted <unk> .
so that last meeting was over , and i felt as wretched as garm , who moaned in his sleep all night .
when we went to the office he found a place under the table close to vixen , and dropped flat till it was time to go home .
there was no more running out into the verandahs , no <unk> away for stolen talks with <name> .
as the weather grew warmer the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart , but sat at my side on the seat , vixen with her head under the crook of my left elbow , and garm hugging the left <unk> .
here vixen was ever in great form .
she had to attend to all the moving traffic , such as <unk> that blocked the way , and camels , and led ponies ; as well as to keep up her dignity when she passed low friends running in the dust .
she never <unk> for <unk> 's sake , but her shrill , high bark was known all along the mall , and other men 's terriers <unk> in reply , and <unk> looked over their shoulders and gave us the road with a grin .
but garm cared for none of these things .
his big eyes were on the horizon and his terrible mouth was shut .
there was another dog in the office who belonged to my chief .
we called him " <name> the librarian , " because he always imagined vain rats behind the <unk> , and in hunting for them would drag out half the old <unk> .
<name> was a well-meaning idiot , but garm did not encourage him .
he would slide his head round the door panting , " rats !
come along garm ! "
and garm would shift one <unk> over the other , and curl himself round , leaving <name> to whine at a most <unk> back .
the office was nearly as cheerful as a tomb in those days .
once , and only once , did i see garm at all contented with his surroundings .
he had gone for an <unk> walk with vixen early one <name> morning , and a very young and foolish <unk> ( his battery had just moved to that part of the world ) tried to steal them both .
vixen , of course , knew better than to take food from soldiers , and , besides , she had just finished her breakfast .
so she trotted back with a large piece of the mutton that they issue to our troops , laid it down on my verandah , and looked up to see what i thought .
i asked her where garin was , and she ran in front of the horse to show me the way .
about a mile up the road we came across our <unk> sitting very stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on his knees .
garin was in front of him , looking rather pleased .
when the man moved leg or hand , garin bared his teeth in silence .
a broken string <name> from his collar , and the other half of , it lay , all warm , in the <unk> 's still hand .
he explained to me , keeping his eyes straight in front of him , that he had met this dog ( he called him awful names ) walking alone , and was going to take him to the fort to be killed for a <unk> pariah .
i said that garin did not seem to me much of a pariah , but that he had better take him to the fort if he thought best .
he said he did not care to do so .
i told him to go to the fort alone .
he said he did not want to go at that hour , but would follow my advice as soon as i had called off the dog .
i instructed garin to take him to the fort , and garm marched him solemnly up to the gate , one mile and a half under a hot sun , and i told the <unk> what had happened ; but the young <unk> was more angry than was at all necessary when they began to laugh .
several regiments , he was told , had tried to steal garm in their time .
that month the hot weather shut down in <name> , and the dogs slept in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is placed .
every morning , as soon as the man filled my bath the two jumped in , and every morning the man filled the bath a second time .
i said to him that he might as well fill a small tub specially for the dogs .
" nay , " said he smiling , " it is not their custom .
they would not understand .
besides , the big bath gives them more space . "
the <unk> who pull the <unk> day and night came to know garin intimately .
he noticed that when the swaying fan stopped i would call out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke .
if the man still slept i would wake him up .
he discovered , too , that it was a good thing to lie in the wave of air under the punkah .
maybe <name> had taught him all about this in barracks .
at any rate , when the punkah stopped , garin would first growl and cock his eye at the rope , and if that did not wake the man it nearly always did  he would tiptoe forth and talk in the sleeper 's ear .
vixen was a clever little dog , but she could never connect the punkah and the coolie ; so garin gave me grateful hours of cool sleep .
but  he was utterly wretched  as miserable as a human being ; and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it , and were envious .
if i moved from one room to another garin followed ; if my pen stopped scratching , garm 's head was thrust into my hand ; if i turned , half awake , on the pillow , garm was up and at my side , for he knew that i was his only link with his master , and day and night , and night and day , his eyes asked one question  " when is this going to end ? "
living with the dog as i did , i never noticed that he was more than ordinarily upset by the hot weather , till one day at the club a man said : " that dog of yours <name> die in a week or two .
he 's a shadow . "
then i dosed garin with iron and quinine , which he hated ; and i felt very anxious .
he lost his appetite , and vixen was allowed to eat his dinner under his eyes .
even that did not make him swallow , and we held a consultation on him , of the best <unk> in the place ; a <unk> , who cured the sick wives of kings ; and the deputy <unk> of the veterinary service of all <name> .
they pronounced upon his symptoms , and i told them his story , and garm lay on a sofa licking my hand .
" he 's dying of a broken heart , " said the <unk> suddenly .
" 'pon my word , " said the deputy inspector general , " i believe mrs. <unk> is perfectly right as usual . "
the best <unk> in the place wrote a prescription , and the veterinary deputy <unk> went over it afterwards to be sure that the drugs were in the proper <unk> ; and that was the first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his <unk> to be edited .
it was a strong tonic , and it put the dear boy on his feet for a week or two ; then he lost flesh again .
i asked a man i knew to take him up to the hills with him when he went , and the man came to the door with his <name> packed on the top of the carriage .
garin took in the situation at one red glance .
the hair rose along his back ; he sat down in front of me and delivered the most awful growl i have ever heard in the jaws of a dog .
i shouted to my friend to get away at once , and as soon as the carriage was out of the garden garin laid his head on my knee and whined .
so i knew his answer , and devoted myself to getting <name> 's address in the hills .
my turn to go to the cool came late in <name> .
we were allowed thirty days ' holiday in a year , if no one fell sick , and we took it as we could be spared .
my chief and <name> the librarian had their holiday first , and when they were gone i made a calendar , as i always did , and <name> it up at the head of my cot , tearing off one day at a time till they returned .
vixen had gone up to the hills with me five times before ; and she appreciated the cold and the damp and the beautiful wood fires there as much as i did .
" garm , " i said , " we are going back to <name> at <unk> .
<unk>  <name> ; <name> <unk> . "
and i repeated it twenty times .
it was not <unk> really , but another place .
still i remembered what <name> had said in my garden on the last night , and i dared not change the name .
then garm began to tremble ; then he barked ; and then he leaped up at me , <unk> and wagging his tail .
" not now , " i said , holding up my hand .
" when i say 'go , ' we 'll go , garm . "
i pulled out the little blanket coat and spiked collar that vixen always wore up in the hills to protect her against sudden chills and <unk> <unk> , and i let the two smell them and talk it over .
what they said of course i do not know ; but it made a new dog of garm .
his eyes were bright ; and he barked joyfully when i spoke to him .
he ate his food , and he killed his rats for the next three weeks , and when he began to whine i had only to say " <name>  <unk> ; <unk>  <name> , " to wake him up .
i wish i had thought of it before .
my chief came back , all brown with living in the open air , and very angry at finding it so hot in the plains .
that same afternoon we three and kadir <unk> began to pack for our month 's holiday , vixen rolling in and out of the <unk> twenty times a minute , and garm grinning all over and thumping on the floor with his tail .
vixen knew the routine of travelling as well as she knew my office-work .
she went to the station , singing songs , on the front seat of the carriage , while garin sat with me .
she hurried into the railway carriage , saw kadir <unk> make up my bed for the night , got her drink of water , and curled up with her <unk> eye on the tumult of the platform .
garin followed her ( the crowd gave him a <name> all to himself ) and sat down on the pillows with his eyes blazing , and his tail a haze behind him .
we came to umballa in the hot <name> <name> , four or five men , who had been working hard fox eleven months , shouting for our <unk>  the <unk> travelling carriages that were to take us up to kalka at the foot of the hills .
it was all new to garm .
he did not understand carriages where you lay at full length on your bedding , but vixen knew and hopped into her place at once ; garin following .
the kalka road , before the railway was built , was about forty-seven miles long , and the horses were changed every eight miles .
most of them <unk> , and kicked , and plunged , but they had to go , and they went rather better than usual for garm 's deep bay in their rear .
there was a river to be forded , and four bullocks pulled the carriage , and vixen stuck her head out of the <unk> and nearly fell into the water while she gave directions .
garin was silent and curious , and rather needed reassuring about <name> and <unk> .
so we rolled , barking and yelping , into kalka for lunch , and garm ate enough for two .
after kalka the road wound among the hills , and we took a <unk> with <unk> ponies , which were changed every six miles .
no one dreamed of a railroad to simla in those days , for it was seven thousand feet up in the air .
the road was more than fifty miles long , and the regulation pace was just as fast as the ponies could go .
here , again , vixen led garm from one carriage to the other ; jumped into the back seat , and shouted .
a cool breath from the snows met us about five miles out of kalka , and she whined for her coat , wisely fearing a chill on the liver .
i had had one made for garm too , and , as we climbed to the fresh breezes , i put it on , and arm chewed it <unk> , but i think he was grateful .
" <unk> ! "
sang vixen as we shot round the curves ; " <unk> ! "
went the driver 's bugle at the dangerous places , and " yow !
yow ! "
<unk> garm .
kadir <unk> sat on the front seat and smiled .
even he was glad to get away from the heat of the plains that <unk> in the haze behind us .
now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work again , and he would say : " what 's it like below ? "
and i would shout : " hotter than cinders .
what 's it like up above ? "
and he would shout back : " just perfect ! "
and away we would go .
suddenly kadir <unk> said , over his shoulder : " here is solon " ; and garm snored where he lay with his head on my knee .
solon is an unpleasant little cantonment , but it has the advantage of being cool and healthy .
it is all bare and <name> , and one generally stops at a <unk> nearby for something to eat .
i got out and took both dogs with me , while kadir <unk> made tea .
a soldier told , us we should find <name> " out there , " nodding his head towards a bare , bleak hill .
when we climbed to the top we spied that very <name> , who had given me all this trouble , sitting on a rock with his face in his hands , and his overcoat hanging loose about him .
i never saw anything so lonely and dejected in my life as this one little man , crumpled up and thinking , on the great gray hillside .
here garm left me .
he departed without a word , and , so far as i could see , without moving his legs .
he flew through the air bodily , and i heard the whack of him as he flung himself at <name> , knocking the little man clean over .
they rolled on the ground together , shouting , and yelping , and hugging .
i could not see which was dog and which was man , till <name> got up and whimpered .
he told me that he had been suffering from fever at intervals , and was very weak .
he looked all he said , but even while i watched , both man and dog <unk> out to their natural sizes , precisely as dried apples swell in water .
garin was on his shoulder , and his breast and feet all at the same time , so that <name> spoke all through a cloud of garin  <unk> , sobbing , <unk> garm .
he did not say anything that i could understand , except that he had fancied he was going to die , but that now he was quite well , and that he was not going to give up garin any more to anybody under the rank of <unk> .
then he said he felt hungry , and thirsty , and happy .
we went down to tea at the <unk> , where <name> stuffed himself with sardines and raspberry jam , and beer , and cold mutton and pickles , when garm was n't climbing over him ; and then vixen and i went on .
garm saw how it was at once .
he said good-bye to me three times , giving me both paws one after another , and leaping on to my shoulder .
he further escorted us , singing <unk> at the top of his voice , a mile down the road .
then he raced back to his own master .
vixen never opened her mouth , but when the cold twilight came , and we could see the lights of simla across the hills , she <unk> with her nose at the breast of my ulster .
i <unk> it , and tucked her inside .
then she gave a contented little sniff , and fell fast asleep , her head on my breast , till we bundled out at simla , two of the four happiest people in all the world that night .
the power of the dog there is sorrow enough in the natural way from men and women to fill our day ; but when we are certain of sorrow in store , why do we always arrange for more ?
brothers and sisters , i bid you beware of giving your heart to a dog to tear .
buy a pup and your money <name> buy love unflinching that can not lie  perfect passion and worship fed by a kick in the ribs or a <name> on the head .
nevertheless it is hardly fair to risk your heart for a dog to tear .
when the fourteen years which nature permits are closing in <unk> , or <unk> , or fits , and the <unk> 's unspoken prescription runs to <unk> chambers or loaded guns , then you <name> find  it 's your own affair but ... you 've given your heart to a dog to tear .
when the body that lived at your single <name> when the whimper of welcome is stilled ( how still ! )
when the spirit that answered your every mood is gone wherever it goes  for good , you <name> discover how much you care , and <name> give your heart to a dog to tear !
we 've sorrow enough in the natural way , when it comes to burying <name> <name> .
our loves are not given , but only lent , at compound interest of cent per cent .
though it is not always the case , i believe , that the longer we 've kept 'em , the more do we grieve : for , when debts are payable , right or wrong , a <unk> <name> is as bad as a long so why in heaven ( before we are there ! )
should we give our hearts to a dog to tear ?
the mother hive if the stock had not been old and <unk> , the wax-moth would never have entered ; but where bees are too thick on the comb there must be sickness or parasites .
the heat of the hive had risen with the <name> <unk> , and though the farmers worked , until their wings ached , to keep people cool , everybody suffered .
a young <name> crawled up the greasy trampled <unk> .
" excuse me , " she began , " but it 's my first <unk> .
could you kindly tell me if this is my  " "  own hive ? "
the guard snapped .
" yes !
buzz in , and be <unk> to you !
next ! "
" shame ! "
cried half a dozen old workers with worn wings and nerves , and there was a scuffle and a hum .
the little grey wax-moth , pressed close in a crack in the <unk> , had waited this chance all day .
she scuttled in like a ghost , and , knowing the senior bees would turn her out at once , dodged into a <unk> , where youngsters who had not yet seen the winds blow or the flowers nod discussed life .
here she was safe , for young bees <name> tolerate any sort of stranger .
behind her came the <name> who had been <unk> by the guard .
" what is the world like , <name> ? "
said a companion .
" cruel !
i brought in a full load of first-class stuff , and the guard told me to go and be <unk> ! "
she sat down in the cool draught across the combs .
" if you 'd only heard , " said the wax-moth <unk> , " the insolence of the guard 's tone when she cursed our sister .
it aroused the entire community . "
she laid an egg .
she had stolen in for that purpose .
" there was a bit of a fuss on the gate , " <name> chuckled .
" you were there , miss ? "
she did not know how to address the slim stranger .
" do n't call me <unk> . '
i 'm a sister to all in affliction  just a <unk> .
my heart bled for you beneath your burden . "
the wax-moth caressed <name> with her soft <unk> and laid another egg .
" you must n't lay here , " cried <name> .
" you are n't a <name> . "
" my dear child , i give you my most solemn word of honour those aren't eggs .
those are my principles , and i am ready to die for them . "
she raised her voice a little above the rustle and tramp round her .
" if you 'd like to kill me , pray do . "
" do n't be unkind , <name> , " said a young <name> , impressed by the chaste folds of the wax-moth 's wing , which hid her ceaseless <unk> .
" i have n't done anything , " <name> answered .
" she 's doing it all . "
" ah , do n't let your conscience reproach you later , but when you've killed me , write me , at least , as one that loved her <unk> . "
laying at every sob , the wax-moth backed into a crowd of young bees , and left <name> bewildered and annoyed .
so she lifted up her little voice in the darkness and cried , " stores ! "
till a gang of <unk> hailed her , and she left her load with them .
" i 'm afraid i <unk> you just now , " said a voice over her shoulder .
" i 'd been on the gate for three hours , and one would <unk> the <name> herself after that .
no offence meant . "
" none taken , " <name> answered cheerily .
" i shall be on guard myself , some day .
what 's next to do ? "
" there 's a rumour of death 's head moths about .
send a gang of youngsters to the gate , and tell them to narrow it in with a couple of stout <unk> pillars .
it 'll make the hive hot , but we ca n't have <unk> <unk> in the middle of our <unk> . "
" my only wings !
i should think not ! "
<name> had all a sound <unk> hereditary hatred against the big , squeaking , feathery thief of the hives .
" tumble out ! "
she called across the youngsters ' quarters .
" all you who are n't feeding babies , show a leg .
<unk> pillars for the <unk> ! "
she chanted the order at length .
" that 's nonsense , " a downy , <unk> <name> answered .
" in the first place , i never heard of a death 's <unk> coming into a hive .
people do n't do such things .
in the second , building pillars to keep 'em out is purely a <unk> trick , unworthy of british bees .
in the third , if you trust a death 's head , he <name> trust you .
<unk> shows lack of confidence .
our dear sister in grey says so . "
" yes .
pillars are <unk> and <unk> , and a waste of wax that is needed for higher and more practical ends , " said the wax-moth from an empty <unk> .
" the safety of the hive is the highest thing i 've ever heard of .
you must n't teach us to refuse work , " <name> began .
" you misunderstand me , as usual , love .
work 's the essence of life ; but to expend precious <unk> vitality and real labour against imaginary danger , that is <unk> absurd !
if i can only teach a  a little toleration  a little ordinary kindness here toward that absurd old <unk> you call the death 's <unk> , i <name> n't have lived in vain . "
" she has n't lived in vain , the darling ! "
cried twenty bees together .
" you should see her saintly life , <name> !
she just <unk> herself to spreading her principles , and  and  she looks lovely ! "
an old , <unk> <name> came up the comb .
" <unk> for the gate !
get out and chew scraps .
buzz off ! "
she said .
the wax-moth slipped aside .
the young bees trooped down the frame , whispering .
" what 's the matter with 'em ? "
said the <unk> .
" why do they call each other <unk> ' and <unk> ' ?
must be the weather . "
she sniffed suspiciously .
" horrid stuffy smell here .
like stale <unk> .
not wax-moth , i <name> , <name> ? "
" not to my knowledge , " said <name> , who , of course , only knew the wax-moth as a <name> with principles , and had never thought to report her presence .
she had always imagined <unk> to be like blood-red dragon-flies .
" you had better fan out this corner for a little , " said the old <name> and passed on .
<name> dropped her head at once , took firm hold with her fore-feet , and fanned obediently at the regulation stroke three hundred beats to the second .
fanning tries a <name> 's temper , because she must always keep in the same place where she never seems to be doing any good , and , all the while , she is wearing out her only wings .
when a <name> can not fly , a <name> must not live ; and a <name> knows it .
the wax-moth crept forth , and caressed <name> again .
" i see , " she murmured , " that at heart you are one of us . "
" i work with the hive , " <name> answered briefly .
" it 's the same thing .
we and the hive are one . "
" then why are your <unk> different from ours ?
do n't <unk> so . "
" do n't be provincial , <unk> .
you ca n't have all the world alike  yet . "
" but why do you lay eggs ? "
<name> insisted .
" you lay 'em like a <name>  only you drop them in patches all over the place .
i 've watched you . "
" ah , <unk> , so you 've pierced my little subterfuge ?
yes , they are eggs .
by and by they 'll spread our principles .
are n't you glad ? "
" you gave me your most solemn word of honour that they were not eggs . "
" that was my little subterfuge , dearest  for the sake of the cause .
now i must reach the young . "
the wax-moth tripped towards the fourth <unk> where the young bees were busy feeding the babies .
it takes some time for a sound <name> to realize a malignant and continuous lie .
" she 's very sweet and feathery , " was all that <name> thought , " but her talk sounds like <name> <name> tastes .
i 'd better get to my <unk> again . "
she found the gate in a sulky uproar .
the youngsters told off to the pillars had refused to chew <unk> because it made their jaws ache , and were clamouring for virgin stuff .
" anything to finish the job ! "
said the <unk> guards .
" <name> up , some of you , and make wax for these <unk> sisters . "
before a <name> can make wax she must fill herself with <name> .
then she climbs to safe foothold and hangs , while other gorged bees <name> on to her in a cluster .
there they wait in silence till the wax comes .
the scales are either taken out of the maker 's pockets by the workers , or tinkle down on the workers while they wait .
the workers chew them ( they are useless <unk> ) into the <unk> , <unk> wax of the hive .
but now , no sooner was the <unk> in position than the workers below broke out again .
" come down ! "
they cried .
" come down and work !
come on , you <unk> parasites !
do n't think to enjoy yourselves up there while we 're sweating down here ! "
the cluster shivered , as from hooked <unk> to hooked <unk> it telegraphed uneasiness .
at last a worker sprang up , grabbed the lowest <unk> , and swung , kicking above her companions .
" i can make wax too ! "
she bawled .
" give me a full gorge and i 'll make tons of it . "
" make it , then , " said the <name> she had <unk> .
the spoken word snapped the current through the cluster .
it shook and glistened like a cat 's fur in the dark .
" <unk> ! "
it murmured .
" no wax for any one to-day . "
" you lazy thieves !
<name> up at once and produce our wax , " said the bees below .
" impossible !
the sweat 's gone .
to make your wax we must have stillness , warmth , and food .
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
they broke up as they murmured , and disappeared among the other bees , from whom , of course , they were undistinguishable .
" seems as if we 'd have to chew <unk> for these pillars , after all , " said a worker .
" not by a whole comb , " cried the young <name> who had broken the cluster .
" listen here !
i 've studied the question more than twenty minutes .
it's as simple as falling off a <name> .
you 've heard of cheshire , root and <unk> ? "
they had not , but they shouted " good old <unk> ! "
just the same .
" those three know all that there is to be known about making hives .
one or t'other of 'em must have made ours , and if they 've made it , they're bound to look after it .
ours is a <unk> patent hive . '
you can see it on the label behind . "
" good old guarantee !
hurrah for the label behind ! "
roared the bees .
" well , such being the case , i say that when we find they 've betrayed us , we can exact from them a terrible vengeance . "
" good old vengeance !
good old root !
<unk> said !
<name> it ! "
the crowd cheered and broke away as <name> dived through .
" d'you know where <unk> , root and cheshire , live if you happen to want em ?
she asked of the proud panting orator .
" gum me if i know they ever lived at all !
but are n't they beautiful names to buzz about ?
did you see how it worked up the <unk> ? "
" yes ; but it did n't defend the gate , " she replied .
" ah , perhaps that 's true , but think how delicate my position is , sister .
i 've a magnificent appetite , and i do n't like working .
it 's bad for the mind .
my instinct tells me that i can act as a restraining influence on others .
they would have been worse , but for me . "
but <name> had already risen clear , and was heading for a breadth of virgin white clover , which to an <unk> <name> is as soothing as plain knitting to a woman .
" i think i 'll take this load to the nurseries , " she said , when she had finished .
" it was always quiet there in my day , " and she topped off with two little <unk> of pollen for the babies .
she was met on the fourth <unk> by a rush of excited sisters all buzzing together .
" one at a time !
let me put down my load .
now , what is it sacharissa ? "
she said .
" grey sister  that fluffy one , i mean  she came and said we ought to be out in the <name> gathering <name> , because life was short .
she said any old <name> could attend to our babies , and some day old bees would .
that is n't true , <name> , is it ?
no old bees can take us away from our babies , can they ? "
" of course not .
you feed the babies while your heads are soft .
when your heads <unk> , you go on to <unk> .
any one knows that . "
" we told her so !
we told her so ; but she only waved her <unk> , and said we could all lay eggs like queens if we chose .
and i 'm afraid lots of the weaker sisters believe her , and are trying to do it .
so <unk> ! "
sacharissa sped to a sealed <unk> whose lid <unk> , as the <name> within began to cut its way out .
" come along , precious ! "
she murmured , and thinned the frail top from the other side .
a pale , damp , creased thing hoisted itself feebly on to the comb .
sacharissa 's note changed at once .
" no time to waste !
go up the frame and <unk> yourself ! "
she said .
" report for <unk> in my <name> to-morrow evening at six .
stop a minute .
what 's the matter with your third right leg ? "
the young <name> held it out in silence  unmistakably a drone leg incapable of packing pollen .
" thank you .
you need n't report till the day after to-morrow . "
sacharissa turned to her companion .
" that 's the fifth oddity hatched in my <name> since noon .
i do n't like it . "
" there 's always a certain number of 'em , " said <name> .
" you ca n't stop a few working sisters from laying , now and then , when they <unk> themselves .
they only raise dwarf drones . "
" but we 're hatching out drones with workers ' stomachs ; workers with drones ' stomachs ; and <unk> and <unk> who ca n't pack pollen  like that poor little beast yonder .
i do n't mind dwarf drones any more than you do ( they all die in july ) , but this steady hatch of oddities <unk> me , <name> ! "
" how narrow of you !
they are all so delightfully clever and unusual and interesting , " piped the wax-moth from a crack above them .
" come here , you dear , downy duck , and tell us all about your feelings . "
" i wish she 'd go ! "
sacharissa lowered her voice .
" she meets these  er  oddities as they dry out , and <unk> 'em in corners . "
" i suppose the truth is that we 're <unk> and too well fed to swarm , " said <name> .
" that is the truth , " said the <name> 's voice behind them .
they had not heard the heavy <name> footfall which sets empty cells vibrating .
sacharissa offered her food at once .
she ate and dragged her weary body forward .
" can you suggest a remedy ? "
she said .
" new principles ! "
cried the wax-moth from her crevice .
" we 'll apply them quietly later . "
" suppose we sent out a swarm ? "
<name> suggested .
" it 's a little late , but it might ease us off . "
" it would save us , but  i know the hive !
you shall see for yourself . "
the old <name> cried the swarming cry , which to a <name> of good blood should be what the trumpet was to job 's <unk> .
in spite of her immense age ( three , years ) , it rang between the <unk> frames as a <unk> rings in a mountain pass ; the <unk> changed their note , and repeated it up in every gallery ; and the <unk> drones , burly and eager , ended it on one <unk> outbreak of bugles : " la <unk> <name> <unk> !
swarm !
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
but the roar which should follow the call was wanting .
they heard a broken grumble like the murmur of a falling tide .
" swarm ?
what for ?
catch me leaving a good <unk> hive , with fixed foundations , for a rotten , old oak out in the open where it may rain any minute !
we 're all right !
it 's a <unk> guaranteed hive . '
why do they want to turn us out ?
swarming be <unk> !
swarming was invented to cheat a worker out of her proper comforts .
come on off to bed ! "
the noise died out as the bees settled in empty cells for the night .
" you hear ? "
said the <name> .
" i know the hive ! "
" quite between ourselves , i taught them that , " cried the wax-moth .
" wait till my principles develop , and you 'll see the light from a new quarter . "
" you speak truth for once , " the <name> said suddenly , for she recognized the wax-moth .
" that light <name> break into the top of the hive .
a hot smoke <name> follow it , and your children <name> not be able to hide in any crevice . "
" is it possible ? "
<name> whispered .
" <unk> have sometimes heard a legend like it . "
" it is no legend , " the old <name> answered .
" i had it from my mother , and she had it from hers .
after the wax-moth has grown strong , a shadow <name> fall across the gate ; a voice <name> speak from behind a veil ; there <name> be light , and hot smoke , and earthquakes , and those who live <name> see everything that they have done , all together in one place , burned up in one great fire . "
the old <name> was trying to tell what she had been told of the <name> master 's dealings with an infected hive in the <unk> , two or three seasons ago ; and , of course , from her point of view the affair was as important as the day of judgment .
" and then ? "
asked horrified sacharissa .
" then , i have heard that a little light <name> burn in a great darkness , and perhaps the world <name> begin again .
myself , i think not . "
" tut !
tut ! "
the wax-moth cried .
" you good , fat people always prophesy ruin if things do n't go exactly your way .
but i <name> you there <name> be changes . "
there were .
when her eggs hatched , the wax was riddled with little tunnels , coated with the dirty clothes of the caterpillars .
<unk> lines ran through the <unk> , the <unk> , the foundations , and , worst of all , through the babies in their <unk> , till the sweeper guards spent half their time tossing out useless little corpses .
the lines ended in a maze of sticky <unk> on the face of the comb .
the caterpillars could not stop spinning as they walked , and as they walked everywhere , they <unk> and <unk> everything .
even where it did not hamper the bees ' feet , the stale , sour smell of the stuff put them off their work ; though some of the bees who had taken to egg laying said it encouraged them to be mothers and maintain a vital interest in life .
when the caterpillars became moths , they made friends with the <unk> oddities  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> drones , <unk> and laying sisters ; and the <unk> band of the old stock worked themselves bald and <unk> to feed their queer charges .
most of the oddities would not , and many , on account of their <unk> , could not , go through a day 's <unk> ; but the <unk> , who were always busy on the <unk> , found pleasant home occupations for them .
one albino , for instance , divided the number of pounds of <name> in stock by the number of bees in the hive , and proved that if every <name> only gathered <name> for seven and three quarter minutes a day , she would have the rest of the time to herself , and could accompany the drones on their <unk> flights .
the drones were not at all pleased .
another , an <unk> drone with no <unk> , said that all <unk> should be perfect circles , so as not to interfere with the grub or the workers .
he proved that the old <unk> cell was solely due to the workers building against each other on opposite sides of the wall , and that if there were no interference , there would be no angles .
some bees tried the new plan for a while , and found it cost eight times more wax than the old six sided <unk> ; and , as they never allowed a cluster to <name> up and make wax in peace , real wax was scarce .
however , they <unk> out their task with varnish stolen from new coffins at funerals , and it made them rather sick .
then they took to <unk> round <unk> and <unk> , because it was easiest to get their material from those places , and the mixture of <unk> and beer naturally <unk> in store and blew the <unk> out of shape , besides smelling abominably .
some of the sound bees warned them that <unk> gains never prosper , but the oddities at once surrounded them and <unk> them to death .
that was a punishment they were almost as fond of as they were of eating , and they expected the sound bees to feed them .
curiously enough the <unk> instinct of loyalty and devotion towards the hive made the sound bees do this , though their reason told them they ought to slip away and unite with some other healthy stock in the <unk> .
" what , about seven and <unk> minutes ' work now ? "
said <name> one day as she came in .
" i 've been at it for five hours , and i 've only half a load . "
" oh , the hive subsists on the <unk> <name> which the hive produces , " said a blind oddity squatting in a <unk> .
" but <name> is gathered from flowers outside two miles away sometimes , " cried <name> .
" pardon me , " said the blind thing , sucking hard .
" but this is the hive , is it not ? "
" it was .
worse luck , it is . "
" and the <unk> <name> is here , is it not ? "
it opened a fresh <unk> to prove it .
" ye-es , but it wo n't be long at this rate , " said <name> .
" the rates have nothing to do with it .
this hive produces the <unk> <name> .
you people never seem to grasp the economic simplicity that <unk> all life . "
" oh , me ! "
said poor <name> , " have n't you ever been beyond the gate ? "
" certainly not .
a fool 's eyes are in the ends of the earth .
mine are in my head . "
it gorged till it bloated .
<name> took refuge in her poorly paid <unk> and told sacharissa the story .
" hut ! "
said that wise <name> , fretting with an old maid of a thistle .
" tell us something new .
the hive 's full of such as him  it , i mean . "
" what 's the end to be ?
all the <name> going out and none coming in .
things ca n't last this way ! "
said <name> .
" who cares ? "
said sacharissa .
" i know now how drones feel the day before they 're killed .
a short life and a <name> one for me . "
" if it only were <name> !
but think of those awful , solemn , <unk> oddities waiting for us at home crawling and clambering and preaching  and <unk> things in the dark . "
" i do n't mind that so much as their silly songs , after we 've fed 'em , all about <unk> among the <name> , <name> blossoms , " said sacharissa from the deeps of a stale canterbury <name> .
" i do .
how 's our <name> ? "
said <name> .
" cheerfully hopeless , as usual .
but she lays an egg now and then . "
" does she so ? "
<name> backed out of the next <name> with a jerk .
" suppose now , we sound workers tried to raise a <name> in some clean corner ? "
" you 'd be put to it to find one .
the hive 's all wax-moth and <unk> .
but  well ? "
" a <name> might help us in the time of the voice behind the veil that the <name> talks of .
and anything is better than working for oddities that <unk> about work that they ca n't do , and waste what we bring home . "
" who cares ? "
said sacharissa .
" i 'm with you , for the fun of it .
the oddities would ball us to death , if they knew .
come home , and we'll begin . "
there is no room to tell how the experienced <name> found a far-off frame so <unk> and <unk> by abandoned <unk> experiments that , for very shame , the bees never went there .
how in that ruin she blocked out a <name> cell of sound wax , but disguised by rubbish till it looked like a <unk> among deserted <unk> .
how she prevailed upon the hopeless <name> to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg .
how the <name> obeyed and died .
how her spent carcass was flung out on the rubbish heap , and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping <unk> where they listed , and said there was no more need of queens .
how , covered by this confusion , sacharissa educated certain young bees to educate certain new-born bees in the almost lost <name> of making <name> jelly .
how the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill winds .
how the hidden egg hatched true  no drone , but blood <name> .
how it was capped , and how desperately they worked to feed and <unk> the now swarming oddities , lest any break in the <unk> should set them to <unk> inquiries , which , with songs about work , was their favourite amusement .
how in an auspicious hour , on a <unk> night , the <name> came forth a <name> indeed , and how <name> smuggled her into a dark empty <unk> , to bide her time ; and how the drones , knowing she was there , went about singing the deep disreputable <unk> of the old days  to the scandal of the laying sisters , who do not think well of drones .
these things are , written in the book of queens , which is laid up in the hollow of the great ash <unk> .
after a few days the weather changed again and became glorious .
even the oddities would now join the crowd that <name> out on the <unk> , and would sing of work among the <name> , <name> blossoms till an untrained ear might have received it for the hum of a working hive .
yet , in truth , their <unk> had been eaten long ago .
they lived from day to day on the efforts of the few sound bees , while the wax-moth fretted and consumed again their already ruined wax .
but the sound bees never mentioned these matters .
they knew , if they did , the oddities would hold a meeting and ball them to death .
" now you see what we have done , " said the <unk> .
" we have created new material , a new convention , a new type , as we said we would . "
" and new possibilities for us , " said the laying sisters gratefully .
" you have given us a new life 's work , vital and paramount . "
" more than that , " chanted the oddities in the <name> ; " you have created a new heaven and a new earth .
heaven , cloudless and accessible " ( it was a perfect <name> evening ) " and earth teeming with the <name> , <name> blossoms , waiting only our honest toil to turn them all to good .
the  er  <unk> , and the <unk> , and the  er  ladies ' <unk> in her season , the chrysanthemum after her kind , and the <unk> rose bringing forth abundantly withal . "
" oh , holy <unk> ! "
said <name> , <unk> .
" i knew they did n't know how <name> was made , but they 've forgotten the order of the flowers !
what <name> become of them ? "
a shadow fell across the <unk> as the <name> master and his son came by .
the oddities crawled in and a voice behind a veil said : " i've neglected the old hive too long .
give me the smoker . "
<name> heard and darted through the gate .
" come , oh come ! "
she cried .
" it is the destruction the old <name> foretold .
<name> , come ! "
" really , you are too archaic for words , " said an oddity in an <unk> .
" a cloud , i admit , may have crossed the sun ; but why hysterics ?
above all , why princesses so late in the day ?
are you aware it 's the <unk> tea-time ?
let 's sing <name> . "
<name> clawed past him with all six legs .
sacharissa had run to what was left of the fertile <unk> .
" down and out ! "
she called across the brown breadth of it .
" nurses , guards , <unk> , sweepers  out ! "
" never mind the babies .
they 're better <unk>  out , before the light and the hot smoke ! "
the <name> 's first clear fearless call ( <name> had found her ) rose and drummed through all the frames .
" la <unk> <name> <unk> !
swarm !
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
the hive shook beneath the shattering thunder of a <unk> quilt being torn back .
" do n't be alarmed , dears , " said the <unk> .
" that 's our work .
look up , and you 'll see the <name> of the new day . "
light broke in the top of the hive as the <name> had , prophesied  naked light on the boiling , bewildered bees .
sacharissa rounded up her <unk> , which dropped headlong off the frame , and joined the <name> 's detachment thrusting toward the gate .
now panic was in full blast , and each sound <name> found herself embraced by at least three oddities .
the first instinct of a frightened <name> is to break into the stores and gorge herself with <name> ; but there were no stores left , so the oddities fought the sound bees .
" you must feed us , or we shall die ! "
they cried , holding and clutching and slipping , while the silent scared <unk> and little spiders twisted between their legs .
" think of the hive , traitors !
the holy hive ! "
" you should have thought before ! "
cried the sound <unk> , " stay and see the <name> of your new day . "
they reached the gate at last over the soft bodies of many to whom they had <unk> .
" on !
out !
up ! "
roared <name> in the <name> 's ear .
" for the <unk> sake !
to the old oak ! "
the <name> left the <unk> , circled once , flung herself at the lowest branch of the old oak , and her little loyal swarm  you could have covered it with a pint mug  followed , hooked , and <name> .
" hold close ! "
<name> gasped .
" the old legends have come true !
look ! "
the hive was half hidden by smoke , and figures moved through the smoke .
they heard a frame crack <unk> , saw it heaved high and twirled round between enormous hands  a blotched , bulged , and perished horror of grey wax , corrupt brood , and small <unk> , all covered with crawling oddities , strange to the sun .
" why , this is n't a hive !
this is a museum of curiosities , " said the voice behind the veil .
it was only the <name> master talking to his son .
" can you blame 'em , father ? "
said a second voice .
" it 's rotten with wax-moth .
see here ! "
another frame came up .
a finger poked through it , and it broke away in rustling flakes of ashy <unk> .
" number four frame !
that was your mother 's pet comb once , " whispered <name> to the <name> .
" many 's the good egg i 've watched her lay there . "
" are n't you confusing pod <unk> with <unk> <unk> ? "
said the <name> master .
" wax-moth only succeed when weak bees let them in . "
a third frame crackled and rose into the light .
" all this is full of laying <unk> brood .
that never happens till the stock 's weakened .
phew ! "
he beat it on his knee like a <unk> , and it also crumbled to pieces .
the little swarm shivered as they watched the dwarf <unk> squirm feebly on the grass .
many sound bees had nursed on that frame , well knowing their work was useless ; but the actual sight of even useless work destroyed <unk> a good worker .
" no , they have some <unk> power left , " said the second voice .
" here 's a <name> cell ! "
" but it 's tucked away among  what on earth has come to the little wretches ?
they seem to have lost the instinct of <unk> . "
the father held up the frame where the bees had experimented in circular <unk> .
it looked like the pitted head , of a decaying <unk> .
" not altogether , " the son corrected .
" there 's one line , at least , of perfectly good cells . "
" my work , " said sacharissa to herself .
" i 'm glad man does me justice before  " that frame , too , was smashed out and thrown atop of the others and the foul <unk> <unk> .
as frame after frame followed it , the swarm beheld the upheaval , exposure , and destruction of all that had been well or ill done in every <unk> of their hive for generations past .
there was black comb so old that they had forgotten where it <name> ; orange , buff , and <unk> <unk> , built as bees were used to build before the days of artificial foundations ; and there was a little , white , frail new work .
there were sheets on sheets of level , even <unk> that had held in its time <unk> thousands of unnamed workers ; patches of obsolete <unk> , broad and <unk> , showing to what marks the male grub was expected to grow ; and <unk> deep <unk> , empty , but still magnificent , the whole <unk> and glued into twisted <unk> , awry on the wires ; <unk> , beginnings abandoned , or <unk> , <unk> , composite cells <unk> out with rubbish and capped with dirt .
good or bad , every inch of it was so riddled by the tunnels of the wax-moth that it broke in clouds of dust as it was flung on the heap .
" oh , see ! "
cried sacharissa .
" the great burning that our <name> foretold .
who can bear to look ? "
a flame crawled up the pile of rubbish , and they smelt <unk> wax .
the figures stooped , lifted the hive and shook it upside down over the pyre .
a cascade of oddities , chips of broken comb , scale , fluff , and <unk> slid out , crackled , <unk> , popped a little , and then the flames roared up and consumed all that fuel .
" we must <unk> , " said a voice .
" get me a <unk> , please . "
the shell of the hive was returned to its place , a light was set in its sticky emptiness , tier by tier the figures built it up , closed the entrance , and went away .
the swarm watched the light leaking through the cracks all the long night .
at <name> one wax-moth came by , fluttering <unk> .
" there has been a <unk> about the new day , my dears , " she began ; " one ca n't expect people to be perfect all at once .
that was our mistake . "
" no , the mistake was entirely ours , " said the <name> .
" pardon me , " said the wax-moth .
" when you think of the enormous upheaval  call it good or bad  which our influence brought about , you <name> admit that we , and we alone  " " you ? "
said the <name> .
" our stock was not strong .
so you came  as any other disease might have come .
<name> close , all my people . "
when the sun rose , veiled figures came down , and saw their swarm at the bough 's end waiting patiently within sight of the old hive  a handful , but prepared to go on .
the bees and the flies a farmer of the <unk> age perused in <name> 's golden <name> , the story of the secret won from proteus by <unk> 's son how the dank <unk> sowed the swain means to restore his hives again more briefly , how a slaughtered bull breeds <name> by the <unk> .
the <unk> rustic put to death a bull by stopping of its breath : disposed the carcass in a shed with fragrant herbs and branches spread .
and , having thus performed the charm , sat down to wait the promised swarm .
nor waited long ...
the god of day impartial , quickening with his <name> evil and good alike , beheld the carcass  and the carcass swelled !
big with new birth the belly heaves beneath its screen of scented leaves ; past any doubt , the bull <unk> !
the farmer bids men bring more hives to house the profit that arrives ; prepares on pan , and key and kettle , sweet music that shall make 'em settle ; but when to crown the work he goes , gods !
what a stink salutes his nose !
where are the honest <unk> ?
where the <unk> mistress of their care ?
a busy scene , indeed , he sees , but not a sign or sound of bees .
worms of the <unk> grave <unk> by any kindly coffin lid , obscene and shameless to the light , <unk> in <unk> appetite , through putrid offal ; while above the hissing <unk> seeks his love , whose offspring , <unk> where they <unk> , consume corruption twice corrupt .
with the night mail a story of 2000 a. d. ( together with extracts from the magazine in which it appeared ) a nine o'clock of a gusty <name> night i stood on the lower stages of one of the <unk> .
outward mail towers .
my purpose was a run to quebec in " postal packet 162 or such other as may be appointed " ; and the <unk> himself <unk> the order .
this <unk> opened all doors , even those in the <unk> at the foot of the tower , where they were delivering the sorted continental mail .
the bags lay packed close as <unk> in the long grey <unk> which our <unk> .
still calls " coaches . "
five such coaches were filled as i watched , and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars .
from the <unk> i was conducted by a courteous and wonderfully learned official mr. <unk> .
<unk> , second <unk> of the western route  to the captains ' room ( this wakes an <name> of old romance ) , where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty .
he introduces me to the captain of " 162 "  captain purnall , and his relief , captain hodgson .
the one is small and dark ; the other large and red ; but each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and <unk> .
you can see it in the pictures of our racing <unk> , from <unk> .
<unk> to little <name> <unk>  that <unk> abstraction of eyes habitually turned through naked space .
on the <unk> in the captains ' room , the pulsing arrows of some twenty <unk> register , degree by geographical degree , the progress of as many homeward-bound packets .
the word " cape " rises across the face of a dial ; a gong strikes : the south african <unk> mail is in at the <unk> receiving towers .
that is all .
it reminds one comically of the <unk> little <name> which in <unk> ' , <unk> <unk> the return of a <name> .
" time for us to be on the move , " says captain purnall , and we are shot up by the <unk> to the top of the <unk> .
" our coach <name> lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard . "
" no .
162 " waits for us in slip e of the topmost stage .
the great curve of her back shines <unk> under the lights , and some minute alteration of trim makes her rock a little in her <unk> slips .
captain purnall frowns and dives inside .
hissing softly , " 162 " comes to rest as level as a rule .
from her north atlantic <name> <unk> ( worn bright as <name> with boring through <unk> leagues of hail , snow , and ice ) to the <unk> of her three built out <unk> is some two hundred and forty feet .
her extreme diameter , carried well forward , is thirty-seven .
contrast this with the nine hundred by ninety-five of any crack liner , and you <name> realize the power that must drive a hull through all weathers at more than the emergency speed of the <unk> !
the eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping <unk> of the <unk>  <unk> 's rudder that assured us the dominion of the unstable air and left its inventor penniless and <unk> .
it is calculated to <unk> 's " <unk> " curve .
raise a few feet of that all but invisible plate <unk> of an inch and she <name> <unk> five miles to port or starboard ere she is under control again .
give her full helm and she returns on her track like a <unk> .
cant the whole forward  a touch on the wheel <name> suffice  and she sweeps at your good direction up or down .
open the complete circle and she presents to the air a <unk> that <name> bring her up all standing within a half mile .
" yes , " says captain hodgson , answering my thought , " <unk> thought he 'd discovered the secret of controlling <unk> when he 'd only found out how to steer dirigible balloons .
<unk> invented his rudder to help <unk> ram each other ; and war went out of fashion and <unk> he went out of his mind because he said he could n't serve his country any more .
i wonder if any of us ever know what we 're really doing . "
" if you want to see the coach locked you 'd better go aboard .
it 's due now , " says mr. <unk> .
i enter through the door amidships .
there is nothing here for display .
the inner skin of the <unk> comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the <unk> .
liners and yachts disguise their tanks with decoration , but the <unk> .
serves them raw under a lick of grey official paint .
the inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern , but the <unk> is <unk> for the <unk> apparatus as the stern is pierced for the <unk> .
the engine-room lies almost amidships .
forward of it , extending to the turn of the bow tanks , is an aperture  a bottomless hatch at present  into which our coach <name> be locked .
one looks down over the <unk> three hundred feet to the <unk> whence voices boom upward .
the light below is obscured to a sound of thunder , as our coach rises on its guides .
it enlarges rapidly from a <unk> to a <unk> ; to a <unk> and last a pontoon .
the two clerks , its crew , do not even look up as it comes into place .
the quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the <unk> racks , while both captains and mr. <unk> satisfy them selves that the coach is locked home .
a clerk passes the <unk> over the hatch <unk> .
captain purnall <unk> and passes it to mr. <unk> .
receipt has been given and taken .
" pleasant run , " says mr. <unk> , and disappears through the door which a foot high <unk> <unk> locks after him .
" <unk> ! "
sighs the <unk> released .
our <unk> <unk> part with a <unk> .
we are clear .
captain hodgson opens the great colloid <unk> <unk> through which i watch <unk> london slide eastward as the <name> gets hold of us .
the first of the low <name> clouds cuts off the well-known view and <unk> <unk> .
on the south edge of it i can see a postal <unk> light ploughing through the white fleece .
for an instant she gleams like a <name> ere she drops toward the <unk> receiving towers .
" the bombay mail , " says captain hodgson , and looks at his watch .
" she 's forty minutes late . "
" what 's our level ? "
i ask .
" four thousand .
are n't you coming up on the bridge ? "
the bridge ( let us ever praise the <unk> .
as a <unk> of <unk> tradition ! )
is represented by a view of captain hodgson 's legs where he stands on the control platform that runs <unk> overhead .
the bow colloid is <unk> and captain purnall , one hand on the wheel , is feeling for a fair slant .
the dial shows <unk> feet .
" it 's steep to-night , " he <unk> , as tier on tier of cloud drops under .
" we generally pick up an easterly draught below three thousand at this time o ' the year .
i hate <unk> through fluff . "
" so does van <unk> .
look at him huntin ' for a slant ! "
says captain hodgson .
a <unk> breaks cloud a hundred fathoms below .
the <unk> night mail makes her signal and rises between two racing clouds far to port , her flanks blood-red in the glare of <unk> double light .
the <name> <name> have us over the north sea in half-an-hour , but captain purnall lets her go composedly  nosing to every point of the compass as she rises .
" five <unk> , six thousand eight hundred "  the <unk> reads ere we find the easterly drift , heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousand fathom level .
captain purnall rings up the engines and keys down the governor on the switch before him .
there is no sense in urging machinery when <unk> himself gives you good knots for nothing .
we are away in <name> now  our nose notched home on our chosen <name> .
at this level the lower clouds are laid out , all neatly combed by the dry fingers of the east .
below that again is the strong westerly blow through which we rose .
overhead , a film of southerly drifting mist draws a theatrical gauze across the firmament .
the moonlight turns the lower strata to silver without a stain except where our shadow <unk> us .
bristol and cardiff double lights ( those statelily inclined beams over <unk> ) are dead ahead of us ; for we keep the southern <name> route .
coventry central , the pivot of the english system , stabs upward once in ten seconds its spear of <name> light to the north ; and a point or two off our starboard bow the <unk> , the great <unk> of saint <unk> head , swings its unmistakable green beam twenty-five degrees each way .
there must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather , but it does not affect the <unk> .
" our planet 's <unk> if anything , " says captain purnall at the wheel , as <unk> slides under .
" i remember the old days of common white <unk> that 'ud show two or three hundred feet up in a mist , if you knew where to look for 'em .
in really fluffy weather they might as well have been under your hat .
one could get lost coming home then , an ' have some fun .
now , it 's like driving down piccadilly . "
he points to the pillars of light where the <unk> bore through the <unk> .
we see nothing of england 's outlines : only a white pavement pierced in all directions by these <unk> of variously coloured fire  holy island 's white and red  st. <name> 's interrupted white , and so on as far as the eye can reach .
blessed be sargent , <unk> , and the <unk> brothers , who invented the <unk> of the world whereby we travel in security !
" are you going to lift for the <unk> ? "
asks captain hodgson .
cork light ( green , fixed ) enlarges as we rush to it .
captain purnall nods .
there is heavy traffic hereabouts  the <unk> beneath us is streaked with running fissures of flame where the atlantic boats are hurrying <unk> just clear of the fluff .
<unk> are supposed , under the conference rules , to have the <unk> lanes to themselves , but the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties with english air .
" no .
162 " lifts to a long-drawn wail of the breeze in the <unk> of the rudder and we make <name> ( white , green , white ) at a safe <unk> feet , dipping our beam to an incoming washington packet .
there is no cloud on the atlantic , and faint streaks of cream round <unk> bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast .
a big <unk> .
liner ( <unk> <unk> des transports <unk> ) is diving and lifting half a mile below us in search of some break in the solid west wind .
lower still lies a disabled <name> she is telling the liner all about it in international .
our general communication dial has caught her talk and begins to <unk> .
captain hodgson makes a motion to shut it off but checks himself .
" perhaps you 'd like to listen , " he says .
" <unk> of st. <name> , " the <name> <unk> .
" report owners three starboard shaft <unk> fused .
can make <unk> as we are , but impossible further .
shall we buy spares at fayal ? "
the liner <unk> and recommends <unk> the bearings .
the <unk> answers that she has already done so without effect , and begins to relieve her mind about cheap <name> <unk> for <unk> .
the frenchman <unk> cordially , cries " courage , mon <name> , " and <unk> off .
then lights sink under the curve of the ocean .
" that 's one of <unk> & <unk> ' boats , " says captain hodgson .
" serves 'em right for putting <name> <unk> in their <unk> .
she won't be in fayal to-night !
by the way , would n't you like to look round the engine-room ? "
i have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and i follow captain hodgson from the <unk> , stooping low to avoid the bulge of the tanks .
we know that fleury 's gas can lift anything , as the <unk> trials of <unk> showed , but its almost indefinite powers of expansion <unk> vast tank room .
even in this thin air the <unk> are busy taking out one-third of its normal lift , and still " 162 " must be checked by an occasional <unk> of the rudder or our flight would become a climb to the stars .
captain purnall prefers an <unk> to an <unk> ship ; but no two captains trim ship alike .
" when i take the bridge , " says captain hodgson , " you 'll see me <unk> forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper rudder .
with a swoop upward instead of a swoop downward , as you say .
either way <name> do .
it 's only habit .
watch our <unk> !
<name> fetches her down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing . "
so is it shown on the <unk> .
for five or six minutes the arrow creeps from <unk> to <unk> .
there is the faint " <unk> " of the rudder , and back slides the arrow to <unk> on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots .
" in heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well , " says captain hodgson , and , <unk> the jointed bar which divides the engine-room from the bare deck , he leads me on to the floor .
here we find <unk> paradox of the <unk> vacuum  which we accept now without thought  literally in full blast .
the three engines are <unk> & t .
<unk> fleury turbines running from 3000 to the limit  that is to say , up to the point when the blades make the air " <name> "  cut out a vacuum for themselves precisely as <unk> <name> propellers used to do .
" 162 's " limit is low on account of the small size of her nine screws , which , though <unk> than the old colloid <unk> , " <name> " sooner .
the <unk> engine , generally used as a <unk> , is not running ; so the port and starboard <unk> <unk> draw direct into the <unk> .
the turbines whistle reflectively .
from the <unk> <unk> on either side the valves descend <unk> to the <unk> , and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a power saw .
behind , is its own pressure held in <unk> of spurred on by the <unk> ; before it , the vacuum where fleury 's <name> dances in <unk> bands and whirled <unk> of flame .
the jointed <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> colloid ( no glass would endure the strain for an instant ) and a <name> engineer with tinted spectacles watches the <name> intently .
it is the very heart of the machine  a mystery to this day .
even fleury who <unk> it and , unlike <unk> , died a <unk> , could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the <unk> can , in the <unk> fraction of a second , strike the furious blast of gas into a chill <unk> liquid that drains ( you can hear it trickle ) from the far end of the vacuum through the <unk> and the <unk> back to the <unk> .
here it returns to its gaseous , one had almost written sagacious , state and climbs to work afresh .
<unk> , upper tank , <unk> , <unk> , vacuum , <unk> ( as a liquid ) , and <unk> once more is the ordained cycle .
<unk> <name> sees to that ; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to fleury 's <name> .
if a speck of oil , if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded <unk> , fleury 's <name> <name> wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again .
this means half a day 's work for all hands and an expense of , one hundred and <unk> pounds to the <unk> .
for <unk> and such trifles .
" now look at our <unk> .
you wo n't find much <name> <unk> there .
<unk> , you see , " says captain hodgson as the engineer <unk> open the top of a cap .
our <unk> are <unk> .
( commercial minerals company ) stones , ground with as much care as the lens of a telescope .
they cost <unk> apiece .
so far we have not arrived at their term of life .
these bearings came from " no .
97 , " which took them over from the old dominion of light which had them out of the wreck of the <unk> <unk> in the years when men still flew wooden kites over oil engines !
they are a shining reproof to all <unk> <name> " <name> " <unk> , so-called " <unk> " facings , and the dangerous and unsatisfactory <unk> compounds which please <unk> owners and turn skippers crazy .
the <unk> and the gas <unk> , seated side by side under the engine-room <unk> , are the only machines in visible motion .
the former sighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch .
the latter , cased and guarded like the <unk> aft , exhibits another fleury <name> , but inverted and more green than <name> .
its function is to <unk> the lift out of the gas , and this it <name> do without watching .
that is all !
a <name> <unk> wheezing and whining to itself beside a sputtering green lamp .
a hundred and fifty feet aft down the flat-topped tunnel of the tanks a <name> light , restless and irresolute .
between the two , three <unk> <unk> , like <unk> laid on their side , <unk> the empty <unk> .
you can hear the trickle of the liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the <unk> and the soft <unk> of <unk> closing as captain purnall brings " 162 " down by the head .
the hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our skin is no more than a <unk> wrapping to the universal stillness .
and we are running an <unk> mile .
i peer from the fore end of the engine-room over the <unk> into the coach .
the <unk> are sorting the winnipeg , <unk> , and medicine hat bags ; but there is a pack of cards ready on the table .
suddenly a <name> thrills ; the engineers run to the <unk> and stand by ; but the <unk> slave of the <name> in the <unk> never lifts his head .
he must watch where he is .
we are <unk> and going astern ; there is language from the control platform .
" <name> 's <unk> badly about something , " says the unruffled captain hodgson .
" let 's look . "
captain purnall is not the <unk> man we left half an hour since , but the embodied authority of the <unk> .
ahead of us floats an ancient , <unk> , <unk> tramp of the <unk> , with no more right to the <unk> <name> than has a <unk> to a modern road .
she carries an obsolete " <unk> " <unk> tower  a six-foot affair with railed platform forward  and our warning beam plays on the top of it as a policeman 's lantern flashes on the area sneak .
like a <unk> , too , <unk> a <unk> navigator in his shirt-sleeves .
captain purnall <unk> open the colloid to talk with him man to man .
there are times when science does not satisfy .
" what under the stars are you doing here , you <unk> <unk> ? "
he shouts as we two drift side by side .
" do you know this is a <unk> ?
you call yourself a sailor , sir ?
you ai n't fit to <unk> toy balloons to an esquimaux .
your name and number !
report and get down , and be  ! "
" i 've been blown up once , " the <unk> man cries , hoarsely , as a dog barking .
" i do n't care two <unk> of a contact for anything you can do , <unk> . "
" do n't you , sir ?
but i 'll make you care .
i 'll have you towed stern first to disko and broke up .
you ca n't recover insurance if you 're broke for obstruction .
do you understand that ? "
then the stranger bellows : " look at my propellers !
there 's been a <unk> down below that has knocked us into <unk> !
we've been blown up about forty thousand feet !
we 're all one <unk> 's watch inside !
my mate 's arm 's broke ; my engineer 's head 's cut open ; my <name> went out when the engines smashed ; and ... and ... for pity 's sake give me my height , captain !
we doubt we 're dropping . "
" six thousand eight hundred .
can you hold it ? "
captain purnall overlooks all insults , and leans half out of the colloid , staring and snuffing .
the stranger leaks <unk> .
" we ought to blow into st. <name> 's with luck .
we 're trying to plug the <unk> now , but she 's simply whistling it away , " her captain wails .
" she 's sinking like a log , " says captain purnall in an undertone .
" call up the banks <name> boat , <name> . "
our <unk> shows that we , keeping abreast the tramp , have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes .
captain purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing through the night , <unk> spokes of light across infinity .
" that 'll fetch something , " he says , while captain hodgson watches the general <unk> .
he has called up the north banks <name> boat , a few hundred miles west , and is reporting the case .
" i 'll stand by you , " captain purnall roars to the lone figure on the conning-tower .
" is it as bad as that ? "
comes the answer .
" she is n't insured .
she's mine . "
" might have guessed as much , " <unk> hodgson .
" owner 's risk is the worst risk of all ! "
" ca n't i fetch st. <name> 's  not even with this breeze ? "
the voice <unk> .
" stand by to abandon ship .
have n't you any lift in you , fore or aft ? "
" nothing but the <unk> tanks , and they 're none too tight .
you see , my <name> gave out and  " he <unk> in the reek of the escaping gas .
" you poor devil ! "
this does not reach our friend .
" what does the <name> boat say , <name> ? "
" wants to know if there 's any danger to traffic .
says she 's in a bit of weather herself , and ca n't quit station .
i 've turned in a general call , so even if they do n't see our beam some one 's bound to help  or else we must .
shall i clear our slings ?
hold on !
here we are !
a planet liner , too !
she 'll be up in a tick ! "
" tell her to have her slings ready , " cries his brother captain .
" there wo n't be much time to spare ...
tie up your mate , " he roars to the tramp .
" my mate 's all right .
it 's my engineer .
he 's gone crazy . "
" <unk> the lift out of him with a <unk> .
hurry ! "
" but i can make st. <name> 's if you 'll stand by . "
" you 'll make the deep , wet atlantic in twenty minutes .
you 're less than fifty-eight hundred now .
get your papers . "
a planet liner , east bound , heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the air of us humming .
her <unk> colloid is open land her <unk> <name> down like tentacles .
we shut off our beam as she <unk> herself  steering to a hair  over the tramp 's conning-tower .
the mate comes up , his arm strapped to his side , and stumbles into the cradle .
a man with a ghastly <name> head follows , shouting that he must go back and build up his <name> .
the mate assures him that he <name> find a nice new <name> all ready in the liner 's engine-room .
the bandaged head goes up wagging excitedly .
a youth and a woman follow .
the liner cheers <unk> above us , and we see the passengers ' faces at the saloon colloid .
" that 's a pretty girl .
what 's the fool waiting for now ? "
says captain purnall .
the skipper comes up , still appealing to us to stand by and see him fetch st. <name> 's .
he dives below and returns  at which we little human beings in the void cheer louder than ever  with the ship 's kitten .
up fly the liner 's hissing slings ; her <unk> <unk> home and she <unk> away again .
the dial shows less than 3000 feet .
the <name> boat signals we must attend to the derelict , now whistling her <unk> , as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags .
" keep our beam on her and send out a general warning , " says captain purnall , following her down .
there is no need .
not a liner in air but knows the meaning of that vertical beam and gives us and our quarry a wide berth .
" but she 'll drown in the water , wo n't she ? "
i ask .
" not always , " is his answer .
" i 've known a derelict <unk> and sift her engines out of herself and flicker round the lower lanes for three weeks on her forward tanks only .
we 'll run no risks .
pith her , <name> , and look sharp .
there 's weather ahead . "
captain hodgson opens the <unk> colloid , swings the heavy <unk> out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a smoking-room settee , and at two hundred feet <unk> the catch .
we hear the whir of the <unk> arms opening as they descend .
the derelict 's forehead is punched in , starred across , and rent diagonally .
she falls stern first , our beam upon her ; slides like a lost soul down that pitiless ladder of light , and the atlantic takes her .
" a filthy business , " says hodgson .
" i wonder what it must have been like in the old days ? "
the thought had crossed my mind , too .
what if that wavering carcass had been filled with the men of the old days , each one of them taught ( that is the horror of it ! )
that , after death he would very possibly go for ever to unspeakable torment ?
and scarcely a generation ago , we ( one knows now that we are only our fathers <unk> upon the earth ) , we , i say , ripped and rammed and <unk> to admiration .
here <name> , from the control platform , shouts that we are to get into our <unk> and to bring him his at once .
we hurry into the heavy rubber suits  the engineers are already dressed  and <unk> at the air-pump taps .
<unk> .
<unk> are thrice as thick as a racing man 's " flickers , " and chafe abominably under the armpits .
<name> takes the wheel until <name> has blown himself up to the extreme of <unk> .
if you kicked him off the c. p. to the deck he would bounce back .
but it is " 162 " that <name> do the kicking .
" the <name> boat 's mad  stark <unk> ' crazy , " he <unk> , returning to command .
" she says there 's a bad blow-out ahead and wants me to pull over to greenland .
i 'll see her <unk> first !
we wasted half an hour fussing over that dead duck down under , and now i 'm expected to go <unk> ' my back all round the pole .
what does she think a postal packet 's made of ?
<unk> silk ?
tell her we 're coming on straight , <name> . "
<name> buckles him into the frame and <unk> on the direct control .
now under <name> 's left toe lies the <unk> <unk> ; under his left heel the reverse , and so with the other foot .
the <unk> stops stand out on the rim of the <unk> where the fingers of his left hand can play on them .
at his right hand is the <unk> engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moment 's notice .
he leans forward in his belt , eyes glued to the colloid , and one ear cocked toward the general <unk> .
henceforth he is the strength and direction of " 162 , " through whatever may befall .
the banks <name> boat is reeling out pages of a .
<unk> directions to the traffic at large .
we are to secure all " loose objects " ; hood up our fleury rays ; and " on no account to attempt to clear snow from our <unk> till the weather <unk> . "
<unk> craft , we are told , can ascend to the limit of their lift , <unk> to look out for them accordingly ; the lower lanes westward are <unk> very badly , " with frequent <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . "
still the clear dark holds up <unk> .
the only warning is the electric <unk> ( i feel as though i were a <unk> 's pillow ) and an irritability which the <unk> of the general <unk> increases almost to hysteria .
we have made eight thousand feet since we <unk> the tramp and our turbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots .
very far to the west an elongated blur of red , low down , shows us the north banks <name> boat .
there are specks of fire round her rising and falling  bewildered planets about an unstable sun  helpless shipping hanging on to her light for company 's sake .
no wonder she could not quit station .
she warns us to look out for the <unk> of the bad vortex in which ( her beam shows it ) she is even now reeling .
the pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous films  <unk> and uneasy shapes .
one forms itself into a globe of pale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by .
it leaps <unk> across the blackness , alights on the precise tip of our nose , <unk> there an instant , and swings off .
our roaring bow sinks as though that light were lead  sinks and recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath the next blow-out .
<name> 's fingers on the <unk> strike chords of <name>  <unk> :  <unk> :  <unk> , and so on ; for he is running by his tanks only , lifting or lowering her against the uneasy air .
all three engines are at work , for the sooner we have skated over this thin ice the better .
higher we dare not go .
the whole upper vault is charged with pale <unk> vapours , which our skin friction may excite to unholy manifestations .
between the upper and lower levels  <unk> and <unk> , hints the <name> boat  we may perhaps bolt through if ... our bow clothes itself in blue flame and falls like a sword .
no human skill can keep pace with the changing <unk> .
a vortex has us by the beak and we dive down a <unk> foot slant at an <name> ( the <unk> and my <unk> body record it ) of thirty-five .
our turbines scream shrilly ; the propellers can not bite on the thin air ; <name> <unk> the lift out of five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her bullet wise through the <unk> till she cushions with jar on an <unk> , three thousand feet below .
" now we 've done it , " says <name> in my ear : " our <unk> , that last slide , has played old <name> with the <unk> !
look out for <unk> , <name> ; she 'll want some holding . "
" i 've got her , " is the answer .
" come up , old woman . "
she comes up nobly , but the <unk> buffet her left and right like the pinions of angry angels .
she is jolted off her course four ways at once , and cuffed into place again , only to be swung aside and dropped into a new chaos .
we are never without a <unk> grinning on our bows or rolling head over heels from nose to <unk> , and to the crackle of electricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of hail  hail that <name> never fall on any sea .
slow we must or we may break our back , <unk> .
" air 's a perfectly elastic fluid , " roars <name> above the tumult .
" about as elastic as a head sea off the <unk> , ai n't it ? "
he is less than just to the good element .
if one <unk> on the heavens when they are balancing their <unk> ; if one disturbs the high gods ' <unk> by hurling steel <unk> at ninety knots across tremblingly adjusted electric <unk> , one must not complain of any rudeness in the reception .
<name> met it with an unmoved countenance , one corner of his under lip caught up on a tooth , his eyes fleeting into the blackness twenty miles ahead , and the fierce sparks flying from his knuckles at every turn of the hand .
now and again he shook his head to clear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows , and it was then that <name> , watching his chance , would slide down the <unk> and swab his face quickly with a big red handkerchief .
i never imagined that a human being could so continuously labour and so <unk> think as did <name> through that hell 's half-hour when the flurry was at its worst .
we were dragged hither and <name> by warm or frozen <unk> , <unk> up on the tops of <unk> , spun down by <unk> and clubbed aside by <unk> under a <unk> rush of stars in the company of a drunken moon .
i heard the rushing click of the <unk> sliding in and out , the low growl of the <unk> , and , louder than the yelling winds without , the scream of the <unk> <unk> into any lull that promised hold for an instant .
at last we began to claw up on a cant , <unk> and <unk> together ; only the nicest balancing of tanks saved us from spinning like the <unk> of the old days .
" we 've got to hitch to windward of that <name> boat somehow , " <name> cried .
" there 's no windward , " i protested feebly , where i swung <unk> to a <unk> .
" how can there be ? "
he laughed  as we pitched into a thousand foot blow-out  that red man laughed beneath his inflated hood !
" look ! "
he said .
" we must clear those refugees with a high lift . "
the <name> boat was below and a little to the <unk> of us , fluctuating in the centre of her distraught galaxy .
the air was thick with moving lights at every level .
i take it most of them were trying to lie head to wind , but , not being <unk> , they failed .
an <unk> <unk> boat had risen to the limit of her lift , and , finding no improvement , had dropped a couple of thousand .
there she met a superb <unk> , and was blown up spinning like a dead leaf .
instead of shutting off she went astern and , naturally , <unk> as from a wall almost into the <name> boat , whose language ( our g. c. took it in ) was humanly simple .
" if they 'd only ride it out quietly it 'ud be better , " said <name> in a calm , while we climbed like a bat above them all .
" but some skippers  <name> navigate without enough lift .
what does that <unk> think she is doing , <name> ? "
" playin ' kiss in the ring , " was <name> 's unmoved reply .
a <unk> direct liner had found a smooth and <unk> into it full power .
but there was a vortex at the tail of that smooth , so the t. a. d. was <unk> out like a pea from off a <unk> , <unk> madly as she fled down and all but <unk> .
" now i <name> she 's satisfied , " said <name> .
" i 'm glad i 'm not a <name> boat ... do i want help ? "
the general <unk> dial had caught his ear .
" <name> , you may tell that gentleman with my love  love , remember , <name>  that i do not want help .
who is the <unk> <unk> ? "
" a <unk> <unk> on the look-out for a tow . "
" very kind of the <unk> <unk> .
this postal packet is n't being towed at present . "
" those <unk> <name> go anywhere on a chance of salvage , " <name> explained .
" we call ' em <unk> . "
a <unk> , bright steel <unk> floated at ease for one instant within hail of us , her slings coiled ready for <unk> , and a single hand in her open tower .
he was smoking .
surrendered to the insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way , he lay in absolute peace .
i saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat dropped , it seemed , like a stone in a well .
we had just cleared the <name> boat and her disorderly neighbours when the storm ended as suddenly as it had begun .
a <unk> to northward filled the sky with the green blink of a <unk> <unk> itself in our atmosphere .
said <name> : " that may iron out all the <unk> . "
even as he spoke , the conflicting winds came to rest ; the levels filled ; the <unk> died out in long , easy swells ; the <unk> were smoothed before us .
in less than three minutes the <unk> round the <name> boat had shipped their <unk> and <unk> away upon their businesses .
" what 's happened ? "
i gasped .
the <unk> within and the <unk> without had passed : my <unk> weighed like lead .
" god , he knows ! "
said captain <name> soberly " that old <unk> <unk> has discharged the different levels .
i 've seen it happen before .
phew : what a relief ! "
we dropped from ten to six thousand and got rid of our clammy suits .
<name> shut off and stepped out of the frame .
the <name> boat was coming up behind us .
he opened the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mopped his face .
" hello , <name> ! "
he cried .
" a degree or two out o ' station , ain't you ? "
" may be , " was the answer from the <name> boat .
" i 've had some company this evening . "
" so i noticed .
was n't that quite a little draught ? "
" i warned you .
why did n't you pull out north ?
the <unk> packets have . "
" me ?
not till i 'm running a polar <unk> ' <unk> boat .
i was <unk> through a colloid before you were out of your cradle , my son . "
" i 'd be the last man to deny it , " the captain of the <name> boat replies softly .
" the way you handled her just now  i 'm a pretty fair judge of traffic in a <unk>  it was a thousand revolutions beyond anything even i 've ever seen . "
<name> 's back <unk> visibly to this oiling .
captain <name> on the c. p. winks and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden pinned up on <name> 's telescope <unk> above the <unk> .
i see .
wholly and entirely do i see !
there is some talk overhead of " coming round to tea on friday , " a brief report of the derelict 's fate , and <name> volunteers as he descends : " for an a .
b. c. man young <name> is less of a <unk> fool than some .
were you thinking of taking her on , <name> ?
then i 'll just have a look round that <unk> seems to me it 's a trifle warm  and we 'll jog along . "
the <name> boat <unk> off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed eyrie .
here she <name> stay a <unk> observatory ; a <unk> station ; a salvage tug ; a court of ultimate <unk> bureau for three hundred miles in all directions , till wednesday next when her relief slides across the stars to take her <unk> place .
her black hull , double conning-tower , and <unk> slings represent all that remains to the planet of that odd old word authority .
she is responsible only to the aerial board of control the a .
b. c. of which <name> speaks so flippantly .
but that <unk> , <unk> body of a few score of persons of both sexes , controls this planet .
" transportation is civilisation , " our motto runs .
theoretically , we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic and all it implies .
practically , the a .
b. c. confirms or <unk> all international arrangements and , to judge from its last report , finds our tolerant , humorous , lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders .
i discuss this with <name> , sipping mate on the c. p. while <name> fans her along over the white blur of the banks in beautiful upward curves of fifty miles each .
the <unk> <unk> them on the tape in flowing <unk> .
<name> gathers up a <unk> of it and surveys the last few feet , which record " 162 's " path through the <unk> .
" i have n't had a <unk> like this to show up in five years , " he says ruefully .
a postal packet 's <unk> records every yard of every run .
the <unk> then go to the a .
b. c. , which <unk> and makes composite photographs of them for the instruction of captains .
<name> studies his <unk> past , shaking his head .
" hello !
here 's a <unk> drop at fifty-five degrees !
we must have been standing on our heads then , <name> . "
" you do n't say so , " <name> answers .
" i fancied i noticed it at the time . "
<name> may not have captain purnall 's <unk> swiftness , but he is all an artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the <unk> .
the delicious <unk> come away on the tape with never a waver .
the <name> boat 's vertical spindle of light lies down to eastward , setting in the face of the following stars .
westward , where no planet should rise , the triple <unk> of <name> bay ( we keep still to the southern route ) make a <unk> haze .
we seem the only thing at rest under all the heavens ; floating at ease till the earth 's revolution shall turn up our <unk> .
and minute by minute our silent clock gives us a <unk> mile .
" some fine night , " says <name> , " we 'll be even with that clock 's master . "
" he 's coming now , " says <name> , over his shoulder .
" i 'm chasing the night west . "
the stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under unobserved , but the deep <unk> on our skin changes to a joyful shout .
" the <unk> , " says <name> .
" it 'll go on to meet the sun .
look !
look !
there 's the dark being crammed back over our bows !
come to the <unk> .
i 'll show you something . "
the engine-room is hot and stuffy ; the clerks in the coach are asleep , and the slave of the <name> is ready to follow them .
<name> slides open the aft colloid and reveals the curve of the world  the ocean 's deepest purple  edged with fuming and intolerable gold .
then the sun rises and through the colloid strikes out our lamps .
<name> <unk> in his face .
" squirrels in a cage , " he <unk> .
" that 's all we are .
squirrels in a cage !
he 's going twice as fast as us .
just you wait a few years , my shining friend , and we 'll take steps that <name> <unk> you .
we 'll <name> you ! "
yes , that is our dream : to turn all earth into the yale of <unk> at our pleasure .
so far , we can drag out the <name> to twice its normal length in these latitudes .
but some day  even on the equator  we shall hold the sun level in his full stride .
now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic .
a big <unk> breaks water suddenly .
another and another follows with a <unk> and a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures .
the deep-sea <unk> are rising to lung up after the long night , and the leisurely ocean is all <unk> with peacock 's eyes of foam .
" we 'll lung up , too , " says <name> , and when we return to the c. p. <name> shuts off , the <unk> are opened , and the fresh air sweeps her out .
there is no hurry .
the old contracts ( they <name> be revised at the end of the year ) allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind her in ten .
so we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which pushes us along at a languid twenty .
to enjoy life , and tobacco , begin both on a <name> morning half a mile or so above the dappled atlantic <unk> and after a <unk> which has cleared and tempered your nerves .
while we discussed the thickening traffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved to ourselves , we heard ( and i for the first time ) the morning hymn on a hospital boat .
she was cloaked by a <unk> of <unk> fluff beneath us and we caught the chant before she rose into the sunlight .
" oh , ye winds of god , " sang the unseen voices : " bless ye the lord !
praise him and magnify him for ever ! "
we slid off our caps and joined in .
when our shadow fell across her great open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands <unk> while they sang .
we could see the doctors and the nurses and the <unk> faces of the <unk> .
she passed slowly beneath us , heading northward , her hull , wet with the dews of the night , all ablaze in the <name> .
so took she the shadow of a cloud and vanished , her song continuing .
" oh , ye holy and humble men of heart , bless ye the lord !
praise him and magnify him for ever . "
" she 's a public <unk> or she would n't have been singing the <unk> ; and she 's a <unk> or she would n't have <unk> over her <unk> , " said <name> at last .
" she 'll be bound for <unk> or one of the glacier <unk> for a month .
if she was an accident <name> she 'd be <name> up at the <unk> level .
yes  <unk> . "
" funny how the new things are the old thing i 've read in books , " <name> answered , " that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to the tops of hills because <unk> were fewer there .
we hoist 'em in <unk> air for a while .
same idea .
how much do the doctors say we've added to the average life of man ? "
" thirty years , " says <name> with a twinkle in his eye .
" are we going to spend 'em all up here , <name> ? "
" flap ahead , then .
flap ahead .
who 's <unk> ? "
the senior captain laughed , as we went in .
we held a good lift to clear the coastwise and continental shipping ; and we had need of it .
though our route is in no sense a populated one , there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along .
we met hudson bay <unk> out of the great preserve , hurrying to make their departure from <unk> with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets .
we <unk> <unk> liners , small and cramped ; but their captains , who see no land between <unk> and <unk> , know what gold they bring back from west <name> .
<unk> <unk> we met , soberly ringing the world round the fiftieth meridian at an honest seventy knots ; and <unk> <unk> & hunt <unk> out of the south fled beneath us , their <unk> <unk> whistling like chinese kites .
their market is in the north among the northern <unk> where you can smell their <unk> and bananas across the cold snows .
<unk> beef boats we sighted too , of enormous capacity and unlovely outline .
they , too , feed the northern health stations in <unk> ports where <unk> dare not rise .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> down leisurely out of the north , like strings of <unk> wild duck .
it does not pay to " fly " minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary ; but the risks of <unk> to <unk> in the ice pack off <unk> or <unk> are so great that these heavy <unk> fly down to halifax direct , and scent the air as they go .
they are the biggest tramps aloft except the <unk> <unk> .
but these last , now that the wheat is moved , are busy , over the world 's shoulder , <unk> in siberia .
we held to the st. <name> ( it is astonishing how the old <unk> still pull us children of the air ) , and followed his broad line of black between its drifting <unk> , all down the park that the wisdom of our fathers  but every one knows the quebec run .
we dropped to the heights receiving towers twenty minutes ahead of time , and there <name> at ease till the yokohama intermediate packet could pull out and give us our proper slip .
it was curious to watch the action of the <unk> <unk> all along the frosty river front as the boats cleared or came to rest .
a big <unk> was leaving <unk> <unk> and her crew , <unk> the platform railings , began to sing " <unk> "  the oldest of our <unk> .
you know it of course : mother <unk> 's <unk> on the baltic forty couple waltzing on the floor !
and you can watch my <name> , for i must go away and dance with <name> <unk> at <unk> !
then , while they sweated home the <unk> : <unk> west from <unk> to the baltic  ninety knot an hour to the <unk> !
mother <unk> 's <unk> on the baltic and a dance with <name> <unk> at <unk> !
the <unk> parted with a gesture of indignant dismissal , as though quebec , glittering under her snows , were casting out these light and unworthy lovers .

for the board : <unk> } <unk> } traffic <unk> } notes <unk> sleet the northern weather so far shows no sign of improvement .
from all quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the higher levels .
racing planes and <unk> alike have suffered severely  the former from <unk> deposits of <unk> slush on their vans ( and only those who have " held up " a badly balanced plane in a <unk> know what that means ) , and the latter from loaded bows and <unk> bodies .
as a consequence , the northern and north-western upper levels have been practically abandoned , and the high <unk> have returned to the ignoble security of the three , five , and six hundred foot levels .
but there remain a few undaunted <unk> who , in spite of frozen stays and <unk> <unk> , still haunt the blue <unk> .
<unk> racing the <unk> of the past few years have at last moved the <unk> world to concerted action in regard to " bat " boat racing .
we have been treated to the spectacle of what are practically <unk> <unk> driven a clear five foot or more above the water , and only eased down to touch their so-called " native element " as they near the line .
judges and <unk> have been conveniently blind to this absurdity , but the public demonstration off st. <name> 's light at the autumn <unk> has borne ample , if tardy , fruit .
in the future the " bat " is to be a boat , and the <unk> demand of the true sportsman for " no daylight under <unk> in smooth water " is in a fair way to be conceded .
the new rule severely <unk> plane area and lift alike .
the gas compartments are permitted both fore and aft , as in the old type , but the <unk> central tank is rendered <unk> .
these things work , if not for perfection , at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome <unk> cruiser .
the type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules , so we may expect to see the <unk> make ( the patent on which has just expired ) come largely into use henceforward , though the strain on the <unk> in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is <unk> very severe .
but <unk> racing has a great future before it .
crete and the a .
b. c. the story of the recent <unk> crisis , as told in the a .
b. c. monthly report , is not without humour .
till the 25th october crete , as all our planet knows , was the sole surviving european <unk> of " <unk> institutions , " " local self-government , " and the rest of the archaic lumber devised in the past for the confusion of human affairs .
she has lived practically on the tourist traffic attracted by her annual pageants of parliaments , boards , municipal councils , etc. , etc .
last summer the islanders grew wearied , as their premier explained , of " playing at being savages for pennies , " and proceeded to pull down all the <unk> on the island and shut off general communication till such time as the a .
b. c. should annex them .
for <unk> comedy we would refer our readers to the correspondence between the board of control and the <unk> premier during the " war . "
however , all 's well that ends well .
the a .
b. c. have taken over the administration of crete on normal lines ; and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the " debates , " " resolutions , " and " popular movements " of the old days .
the only people to suffer <name> be the board of control , which is grievously overworked already .
it is easy enough to condemn the <unk> for their laziness ; but when one recalls the large , prosperous , and presumably <unk> communities which during the last few years have deliberately thrown themselves into the hands of the a .
b. c. , one , can not be too hard upon st. <name> 's old friends .
correspondence skylarking on the equator to the editor : only last week , while crossing the equator ( w. <unk> ) , i became aware of a furious and irregular <unk> some fifteen or twenty knots s. 4 e. descending to the 500 ft. level , i found a party of <unk> tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs ( a .
b. c. standard ) and , in the intervals of their pleasing labours , firing bow and stern <unk> <unk> .
this <unk>  i can give it no other name  went on for at least two hours , and naturally produced violent electric <unk> .
my compasses , of course , were thrown out , my bow was struck twice , and i received two brisk shocks from the lower <unk> .
on <unk> , i was told that these " professors " were engaged in scientific experiments .
the extent of their " scientific " knowledge , may be judged by the fact that they expected to produce ( i give their own words ) " a little blue sky " if " they went on long enough . "
this in the heart of the doldrums at 450 feet !
i have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place ( it can be found at the <unk> level for practically twelve months out of the year ) , but i submit , with all deference to the educational needs of <unk> , that " skylarking " in the centre of a <unk> road where , at the best of times , electricity literally <unk> off one's stanchions and screw blades , is unnecessary .
when my friends had finished , the road was seared , and blown , and pitted with unequal pressure layers , spirals , <unk> , and <unk> for at least an hour .
i pitched badly twice in an upward rush  solely due to these diabolical <unk>  that came near to wrecking my propeller .
equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of scientific <unk> in the doldrums .
<unk> .
j. <name> <unk> .
[ we entirely sympathize with professor <unk> 's views , but till the board sees fit to further regulate the southern areas in which scientific experiments may be conducted , we shall always be exposed to the risk which our correspondent describes .
unfortunately , a <unk> <unk> in a vacuum is , nowadays , only too capable of producing secondary <unk>  editor . ]
answers to correspondents <unk>  the laws of <unk> <unk> are still imperfectly understood .
any <unk> motor may of course " seize " without warning ; but so many complaints have reached us of accidents similar to yours while shooting the <name> that we are inclined to believe with lavalle that the upper strata of the <name> borealis are practically one big electric " leak , " and that the paralysis of your engines was due to complete <unk> of all metallic parts .
<unk> planes often " glue up " when near the magnetic pole , and there is no reason in science why the same <unk> should not be experienced at higher levels when the <unk> are " delivering " strongly .
indignant  on your own showing , you were not under control .
that you could not hoist the necessary n. u. c. lights on approaching a <unk> because your electrics had <unk> is a misfortune which might befall any one .
the a .
b. c. , being responsible for the planet 's traffic , can not , however , make allowance for this kind of misfortune .
a reference to the code <name> show that you were fined on the lower scale .
<unk>  ( 1 ) the five thousand <unk> ( overland ) was won last year by l. v. <unk> ; r. m. <unk> , his brother , in the same week pulling off the ten thousand ( oversee ) .
r. m. 's average worked out at a fraction over 500 <unk> per hour , thus constituting a record .
( 2 ) theoretically , there is no limit to the lift of a dirigible .
for commercial and practical purposes 15,000 tons is accepted as the most <unk> .
<unk>  none whatever .
he is liable for direct damage both to your chimneys and any collateral damage caused by fall of bricks into garden , etc. , etc .
bodily inconvenience and mental anguish may be included , but the average courts are not , as a rule , swayed by sentiment .
if you can prove that his grapnel removed any portion of your roof , you had better rest your case on <unk> of <unk> ( see <unk> v. <unk> ) .
we sympathize with your position , but the night of the 14th was <name> and confused , and  you may have to anchor on a stranger 's chimney yourself some night .
<unk> sap !
<unk>  ( 1 ) war , as a paying concern , ceased in <unk> .

( 2 ) nothing is to be gained by reversing into a following <name> , and there is always risk of a <unk> .
( 3 ) the <unk> for <unk> brakes are uniformly unreliable , and <name> continue to be so as long as air is <unk> .
<unk>  ( 1 ) personally we prefer glass or flux compounds to any other material for <name> work <unk> as being absolutely <unk> .
( 2 ) we can not recommend any particular make .

the low levels of most of the <unk> <unk> are against them except at the outset of the disease .
( 2 ) we do not recommend <unk> or hotels in this column .
beginner  on still days the air above a large inhabited city being slightly warmer  i.e. , thinner  than the atmosphere of the surrounding country , a plane drops a little on entering the rarefied area , precisely as a ship sinks a little in fresh water .
hence the phenomena of " jolt " and your " inexplicable collisions " with factory chimneys .

review the life of <name> lavalle ( reviewed by <name> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <name> ) ten years ago lavalle , " that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens , " as <unk> hailed him , gathered together the fruits of a <unk> labour , and gave it , with <unk> contempt , to a world bound hand and foot to <unk> 's theory of <unk> and " compensating electric <unk> . "
" they shall see , " he wrote  in that immortal postscript to the heart of the cyclone  " the laws whose existence they derided written in fire beneath them . "
" but even here , " he continues , " there is no <unk> .
better a thousand times my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should lie across the threshold of the <name> of science  a bar to further inquiry . "
so died lavalle  a <name> of the powers of the air , and even at his funeral <unk> <unk> at " him who had gone to discover the secrets of the <name> borealis . "
if i choose thus to be <unk> , it is only to remind you that <unk> theories are today as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the spanish school .
in the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we have , definitely , lavalle 's law of the cyclone which he surprised in darkness and cold at the foot of the <unk> throne of the <name> borealis .
it is there that i , intent on my own investigations , have passed and <unk> a hundred times the worn <unk> face , white as the snow beneath him , furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and <unk> upon the north cape ; the nervous hand , <unk> a part of the mechanism of his <unk> ; and above all , the wonderful <unk> eyes turned to the zenith .
" master , " i would cry as i moved respectfully beneath him , " what is it you seek today ? "
and always the answer , clear and without doubt , from above : " the old secret , my son ! "
the immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path , but ( cry of the human always ! )
had i known  if i had known  i would many times have bartered my poor laurels for the privilege , such as <unk> and <unk> possess , of having aided him in his monumental researches .
it is to the filial piety of <name> lavalle that we owe the two volumes consecrated to the <unk> of his father , so full of the holy <unk> of the domestic hearth .
once returned from the <unk> of the utter north to that little house upon the outskirts of <unk> , it was not the philosopher , the daring observer , the man of iron energy that imposed himself on his family , but a fat and even plaintive jester , a <unk> incarnate and kindly , the <unk> of his children , and , it must be written , not seldom the comic despair of madame lavalle , who , as she writes five years after the marriage , to her venerable mother , found " in this <unk> intellect whose name i bear the abandon of a large and very untidy boy . "
here is her letter : " <name> returned from i do not know where at midnight , absorbed in calculations on the eternal question of his <name>  la <name> <name> , whom i begin to hate .
instead of <unk> ,  i had set out the <unk> above our roof , so he had but to descend and fasten the plane  he wandered , profoundly distracted , above the town with his anchor down !
figure to yourself , dear mother , it is the roof of the mayor 's house that the grapnel first engages !
that i do not regret , for the mayor 's wife and i are not sympathetic ; but when <name> <unk> my pet <unk> and bears it across the garden into the conservatory i protest at the top of my voice .
little <name> in his <unk> runs to the window , enormously amused at the <unk> flight without reason , for it is too dark to see the grapnel , of my prized tree .
the mayor of <unk> , thunders at our door in the name of the law , demanding , i suppose , my husband 's head .
here is the conversation through the megaphone  <name> is two hundred feet above us : " <unk> .
lavalle , descend and make <unk> for outrage of <unk> .
descend , mons .
lavalle ! '
" no one answers .
" <unk> lavalle , in the name of the law , descend and submit to process for outrage of <unk> . '
" <name> , roused from his calculations , comprehending only the last words : <unk> of <unk> ?
my dear mayor , who is the man that has corrupted thy <name> ? '
" the mayor , furious , <unk> lavalle  ' " <name> , interrupting : 'i have not that felicity .
i am only a dealer in <unk> ! '
" my <name> , he raised one then !
all <unk> attended in the streets , and my <name> , after a long time comprehending what he had done , excused himself in a thousand apologies .
at last the reconciliation was effected in our house over a supper at two in the morning  <name> in a wonderful costume of <unk> , and i have her and the mayor pacified in bed in the blue room . "
and on the next day , while the mayor <unk> his roof , her <name> departs anew for the <name> borealis , there to commence his life 's work .
m. <name> lavalle tells us of that historic collision ( en plane ) on the flank of <unk> between <unk> , then a pillar of the spanish school , and the man destined to <unk> his theories and lead him intellectually captive .
even through the years , the immense laugh of lavalle as he <unk> the spaniard 's wrecked plane , and cries : " courage !
i shall not fall till i have found truth , and i hold you fast ! "
rings like the call of trumpets .
this is that lavalle whom the world , immersed in speculations of immediate gain , did not know nor suspect  the lavalle whom they <unk> to the last a <unk> and a <unk> .
the human , as apart from the scientific , side ( developed in his own volumes ) of his <unk> discoveries is marked with a simplicity , <unk> , and good sense beyond praise .
i would specially refer such as doubt the sustaining influence of ancestral <name> upon character and <name> to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters , in which are contained the opening and consummation of the <unk> records extending over nine years .
of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest house at <unk> knew as little as that the records would one day be the planet 's standard in all official <unk> .
it was enough for them that their <name>  this son , this father , this husband  ascended periodically to <unk> with powers , it might be <name> , beyond their comprehension , and that they united daily in prayers for his safety .
" pray for me , " he says upon the <name> of each of his excursions , and returning , with an equal simplicity , he renders thanks " after supper in the little room where he kept his <unk> . "
to the last lavalle was a catholic of the old school , accepting  he who had looked into the very heart of the lightnings  the dogmas of papal infallibility , of <unk> , of confession  of relics great and small .
marvellous  enviable contradiction !
the completion of the <unk> records closed what lavalle himself was pleased to call the theoretical side of his labours  labours from which the youngest and least <unk> <unk> might well have shrunk .
he had traced through cold and heat , across the deeps of the oceans , with instruments of his own invention , over the inhospitable heart of the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts , league by league , patiently , <unk> , remorselessly , from their <unk> cradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted death-bed in the utmost ether of the upper atmosphere each one of the <unk> <unk> lavalle 's curves , as we call them today .
he had <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> , assigning to each its regulated period of flux and <unk> .
thus equipped , he summons <unk> and <unk> , his pupils , to the final demonstration as calmly as though he were ordering his <unk> for some mid-day journey to marseilles .
" i have proved my <unk> , " he writes .
" it remains now only that you should witness the proof .
we go to manila to-morrow .
a cyclone <name> form off the <unk> s. 17 e. in four days , and <name> reach its maximum intensity twenty-seven hours after <unk> .
it is there i <name> show you the truth . "
a letter heretofore unpublished from <unk> to madame lavalle tells us how the master 's prophecy was verified .
i <name> not destroy its simplicity or its significance by any attempt to quote .
note well , though , that <unk> 's <unk> throughout that day and night of superhuman strain is always for the master 's bodily health and comfort .
" at such a time , " he writes , " i forced the master to take the broth " ; or " i made him put on the fur coat as you told me . "
nor is <unk> ( see pp .
184 , 85 ) less concerned .
he prepares the nourishment .
he cooks eternally , <unk> , suspended in the chaos of which the master <unk> the meaning .
<unk> , bowed down with the laurels of both hemispheres , raises himself to yet nobler heights in his capacity of a devoted chef .
it is almost unbelievable !
and yet men write of the master as cold , aloof , self-contained .
such characters do not <unk> the joyous and <unk> devotion which lavalle commanded throughout life .
truly , we have changed very little in the course of the ages !
the secrets of earth and sky and the links that bind them , we <unk> ourselves we are on the road to discover ; but our neighbours ' heart and mind we <unk> , we <unk> , we condemn now as ever .

a deal in cotton long and long ago , when <unk> was king of benares , i wrote some tales concerning strickland of the punjab police ( who married miss youghal ) , and <name> , his son .
strickland has finished his indian service , and lives now at a place in england called <unk> , where his wife plays the organ in one of the churches .
<unk> he comes up to london , and occasionally his wife makes him visit his friends .
otherwise he plays golf and follows the <unk> for his figure 's sake .
if you remember that infant who told a tale to <unk> cleever the novelist , you <name> remember that he became a <unk> with a vast estate .
he has , owing to cookery , a little lost his figure , but he never loses his friends .
i have found a wing of his house turned into a hospital for sick men , and there i once spent a week in the company of two dismal nurses and a specialist in " <unk> . "
another time the place was full of schoolboys  sons of <unk> whom the infant had collected for the holidays , and they nearly broke his keeper 's heart .
but my last visit was better .
the infant called me up by wire , and i fell into the arms of a friend of mine , colonel <unk> .
corkran , so that the years departed from us , and we praised allah , who had not yet terminated the delights , nor separated the companions .
said corkran , when he had explained how it felt to command a native infantry regiment on the border : " the <unk> are coming for <unk> their boy . "
" i remember him .
the little fellow i wrote a story about , " i said .
" is he in the service ? "
" no .
<unk> got him into the <unk> <unk> .
he's <unk> at dupe  wherever that is .
<unk> , ai n't it , stalky ? "
asked the infant .
stalky puffed out his nostrils scornfully .
" you 're only three thousand miles out .
look at the atlas . "
" anyhow , he 's as rotten full of fever as the rest of you , " said the infant , at length on the big <unk> .
" and he 's bringing a native servant with him .
stalky be an athlete , and tell ipps to put him in the stable room . "
" why ?
is he a <unk>  like the fellow <name> brought here  when your housekeeper had fits ? "
stalky often visits the infant , and has seen some odd things .
" no .
he 's one of old strickland 's punjabi policemen  and quite european  i believe . "
" hooray !
have n't talked punjabi for three months  and a punjabi from central africa ought to be <unk> ' . "
we heard the <unk> of the motor in the porch , and the first to enter was <name> strickland , whom the infant makes no secret of adoring .
he is devoted , in a fat man 's placid way , to at least eight designing women ; but she nursed him once through a bad <unk> of peshawur fever , and when she is in the house , it is more than all hers .
" you did n't send rugs enough , " she began .
" <name> might have taken a chill . "
" it 's quite warm in the tonneau .
why did you let him ride in front ? "
" because he wanted to , " she replied , with the mother 's smile , and we were introduced to the shadow of a young man leaning heavily on the shoulder of a bearded punjabi mohammedan .
" that is all that came home of him , " said his father to me .
" there was nothing in it of the child with whom i had journeyed to dalhousie centuries since . "
" and what is this uniform ? "
stalky asked of imam din , the servant , who came to attention on the marble floor .
" the uniform of the <unk> troops , sahib .
though i am the little sahib 's body-servant , it is not seemly for us white men to be attended by folk dressed altogether as servants . "
" and  and you white men wait at table on horseback ? "
stalky pointed to the man 's spurs .
" these i added for the sake of honour when i came to england , " said imam din <name> smiled the ghost of a little smile that i began to remember , and we put him on the big couch for refreshments .
stalky asked him how much leave he had , and he said " six months . "
" but he 'll take another six on medical certificate , " said <name> anxiously .
<name> knit his brows .
" you do n't want to  eh ?
i know .
wonder what my second in command is doing . "
stalky tugged his moustache , and fell to thinking of his sikhs .
" ah ! "
said the infant .
" i 've only a few thousand pheasants to look after .
come along and dress for dinner .
we 're just ourselves .
what flower is your honour 's <unk> commanding for the table ? "
" just ourselves ? "
she said , looking at the <unk> in the great hall .
" then let 's have <unk> the little cemetery ones . "
so it was ordered .
now , <unk> to us mean hot weather , discomfort , parting , and death .
that smell in our nostrils , and <name> 's servant in waiting , we naturally fell back more and more on the old slang , recalling at each glass those who had gone before .
we did not sit at the big table , but in the bay window overlooking the park , where they were <unk> the last of the hay .
when twilight fell we would not have candles , but waited for the moon , and continued our talk in the dusk that makes one remember .
young <name> was not interested in our past except where it had touched his future .
i think his mother held his hand beneath the table .
imam din  shoeless , out of respect to the floors  brought him his medicine , poured it drop by drop , and asked for orders .
" wait to take him to his cot when he grows weary , " said his mother , and imam din retired into the shadow by the ancestral portraits .
" now what d'you expect to get out of your country ? "
the infant asked , when  our <name> laid aside we talked <name> 's africa .
it roused him at once .
" rubber  nuts  gums  and so on , " he said .
" but our real future is cotton .
i grew fifty acres of it last year in my district . "
" my district ! "
said his father .
" hear him , mummy ! "
" i did though !
i wish i could show you the sample .
some manchester chaps said it was as good as any sea island cotton on the market . "
" but what made you a <unk> , my son ? "
she asked .
" my chief said every man ought to have a <unk> ( a hobby ) of sorts , and he took the trouble to ride a day out of his way to show me a belt of black soil that was just the thing for cotton . "
" ah !
what was your chief like ? "
stalky asked , in his <unk> tones .
" the best man alive  absolutely .
he lets you blow your own nose yourself .
the people call him "  <name> jerked out some heathen phrase  " that means the man with the stone eyes , you know . "
" i 'm glad of that .
because i 've heard from other quarters " <unk> sentence burned like a slow match , but the explosion was not long delayed .
" other quarters ! "
<name> threw out a thin hand .
" every dog has his fleas .
if you listen to them , of course ! "
the shake of his head was as i remembered it among his father 's policemen twenty years before , and his mother 's eyes shining through the dusk called on me to adore it .
i kicked stalky on the <name> .
one must not mock a young man 's first love or loyalty .
a lump of raw cotton appeared on the table .
" i thought there might be a need .
therefore i packed it between our shirts , " said the voice of imam din .
" does he know as much english as that ? "
cried the infant , who had forgotten his east .
we all admired the cotton for <name> 's sake , and , indeed , it was very long and glossy .
" it 's  it 's only an experiment , " he said .
" we 're such awful paupers we ca n't even pay for a <unk> in my district .
we use a <unk> on two bicycle wheels .
i only got the money for that "  he patted the stuff  " by a pure <unk> . "
" how much did it cost ? "
asked strickland .
" with seed and machinery  about two hundred pounds .
i had the labour done by cannibals . "
" that sounds promising . "
stalky reached for a fresh cigarette .
" no , thank you , " said <name> .
" i 've been at <unk> a little too long for cannibals .
i 'll go to the <unk> and try over next <name> 's hymns . "
she lifted the boy 's hand lightly to her lips , and tripped across the acres of glimmering floor to the <unk> that had been the <unk> ancestors ' <unk> hall .
her grey and silver dress disappeared under the musicians ' gallery ; two electrics broke out , and she stood backed against the lines of gilded pipes .
" there 's an abominable <unk> attachment here ! "
she called .
" me ! "
the infant answered , his napkin on his shoulder .
" that 's how i play <unk> . "
" i prefer the direct expression .
take it away , ipps . "
we heard old ipps skating obediently all over the floor .
" now for the direct expression , " said stalky , and moved on the burgundy recommended by the faculty to enrich <unk> blood .
" it 's nothing much .
only the belt of <unk> my chief showed me ran right into the <unk> country .
we have n't been able to prove <unk> against that tribe in the courts ; but when a <unk> offers you four pounds of woman 's breast , tattoo marks and all , <unk> up in a <unk> leaf before breakfast , you  " " naturally burn the villages before lunch , " said stalky .
<name> shook his head .
" no troops , " he sighed .
" i told my chief about it , and he said we must wait till they chopped a white man .
he advised me if ever i felt like it not to commit a  a barren <unk> de se , but to let the <unk> do it .
then he could report , and then we could mop 'em up ! "
" most immoral !
that 's how we got  " stalky quoted the name of a province won by just such a sacrifice .
" yes , but the beasts dominated one end of my <unk> like anything .
they <unk> me out of it when i went to take soil for analysis  me and imam din . "
" sahib !
is there a need ? "
the voice came out of the darkness , and the eyes shone over <name> 's shoulder ere it ceased .
" none .
the name was taken in talk . "
<name> abolished him with a turn of the finger .
" i could n't make a <unk> <unk> of it just then , because my chief had taken all the troops to hammer a gang of slave kings up north .
did you ever hear of our war against <unk> <unk> ?
he precious nearly lost us the <unk> at one time , though he 's an ally of ours now . "
" was n't he rather a pernicious brute , even as they go ? "
said stalky .
" <name> told me about him last year . "
" well , his nickname all through the country was 'the merciful , ' and he did n't get that for nothing .
none of our people ever breathed his proper name .
they said 'he ' or 'that one , ' and they did n't say it aloud , either .
he fought us for eight months . "
" i remember .
there was a paragraph about it in one of the papers , " i said .
" we broke him , though .
no  the <unk> do n't come our way , because our men have the reputation of dying too much , the first month after they're captured .
that knocks down profits , you see . "
" what about your charming friends , the <unk> ? "
said the infant .
" there 's no market for <unk> .
people would as soon buy crocodiles .
i believe , before we annexed the country , <unk> <unk> dropped down on 'em once  to train his young men  and simply <unk> 'em in pieces .
the bulk of my people are agriculturists just the right stamp for <unk> .
what 's mother playing ?  'once in <name> ' ? "
the organ that had been crooning as happily as a woman over her babe restored , steadied to a tune .
" magnificent !
oh , magnificent ! "
said the infant loyally .
i had never heard him sing but once , and then , though it was early in the tolerant morning , his mess had rolled him into a lotus pond .
" how did you get your cannibals to work for you ? "
asked strickland .
" they got converted to civilization after my chief smashed <unk> <unk>  just at the time i wanted 'em .
you see my chief had promised me in writing that if i could scrape up a surplus he would not bag it for his roads this time , but i might have it for my cotton game .
i only needed two hundred pounds .
our revenues did n't run to it . "
" what is your revenue ? "
stalky asked in the vernacular .
" with <unk> , traders ' game and mining <unk> , not more than fourteen thousand rupees ; every <name> of it <unk> months ahead . "
<name> sighed .
" also there is a fine for dogs <unk> in the sahib 's camp .
last year it exceeded three rupees , " imam din said quietly .
" well , i thought that was fair .
they howled so .
we were rather strict on fines .
i worked up my native clerk  <unk> ram  to a ferocious pitch of enthusiasm .
he used to calculate the profits of our <unk> to three points of decimals , after office .
i tell you i envied your magistrates here hauling money out of <unk> every week i had managed to make our ordinary revenue and expenditure just about meet , and i was crazy to get the odd two hundred pounds for my cotton .
that sort of thing grows on a chap when he 's alone  and talks aloud ! "
" <unk> !
have you been there already ? "
the father said , and <name> nodded .
" yes .
used to spout what i could remember of <unk> ' to a tree , sir .
well then my luck turned .
one evening an english-speaking nigger came in towing a corpse by the feet .
( you get used to little things like that . )
he said he 'd found it , and please would i identify , because if it was one of <unk> <unk> 's men there might be a reward .
it was an old mohammedan , with a strong dash of arab  a <unk> , bald-headed chap , and i was just wondering how it had kept so well in our climate when it sneezed .
you ought to have seen the nigger !
he fetched a howl and bolted like  like the dog in <unk> sawyer , ' when he sat on the <unk> beetle .
he <unk> as he ran , and the corpse went on sneezing .
i could see it had been <unk> .
( that 's a sort of <unk> , pater , which attacks the nerve centres .
our chief medical officer is writing a monograph about it . )
so imam din and i emptied out the corpse one time , with my shaving soap and trade gunpowder , and hot water .
" i 'd seen a case of <unk> before ; so when the skin peeled off his feet , and he stopped sneezing , i knew he 'd live .
he was bad , though ; lay like a log for a week while imam din and i <unk> the paralysis out of him .
then he told us he was a hajji  had been three times to mecca  come in from french africa , and that he 'd met the nigger by the wayside  just like a case of <unk> , in <name>  and the nigger had poisoned him .
that seemed reasonable enough by what i knew of coast niggers . "
" you believed him ? "
said his father keenly .
" there was no reason i should n't .
the nigger never came back , and the old man stayed with me for two months , " <name> returned .
" you know what the best type of a mohammedan gentleman can be , pater ?
he was that . "
" none finer , none finer , " was the answer .
" except a sikh , " stalky grunted .
" he 'd been to bombay ; he knew french africa inside out ; he could quote poetry and the koran all day long .
he played chess  you do n't know what that meant to me  like a master .
we used to talk about the regeneration of turkey and the <unk> between moves .
oh , everything under the sun we talked about !
he was awfully <unk> .
he believed in slavery , of course , but he quite saw that it would have to die out .
that 's why he agreed with me about developing the resources of the district by <unk> , you know . "
" you talked of that too ? "
said strickland .
" rather .
we discussed it for hours .
you do n't know what it meant to me .
a wonderful man .
imam din , was not our hajji marvellous ? "
" most marvellous !
it was all through the hajji that we found the money for our <unk> . "
imam din had moved , i fancy , behind <unk> chair .
" yes .
it must have been dead against his convictions too .
he brought me news when i was down with fever at dupe that one of <unk> <unk> 's men was parading through my district with a bunch of slaves  in the fork ! "
" what 's the matter with the fork , that you ca n't abide it ? "
said stalky .
<name> 's voice had risen at the last word .
" local etiquette , sir , " he replied , too <name> to notice <unk> atrocious pun .
" if a slaver runs slaves through british territory he ought to pretend that they 're his servants .
<unk> ' 'em about in the fork  the forked stick that you put round their necks , you know  is insolence  same as not backing your <unk> in the old days .
besides , it <unk> the district . "
" i thought you said <unk> did n't come your way , " i put in .
" they do n't .
but my chief was smoking 'em out of the north all that season , and they were <unk> into french territory any road they could find .
my orders were to take no notice so long as they circulated , but open <unk> in the fork , was too much .
i could n't go myself , so i told a couple of our <unk> police and imam din to make talk with the gentleman one time .
it was rather risky , and it might have been expensive , but it turned up <unk> .
they were back in a few days with the slaver ( he did n't show fight ) and a whole crowd of witnesses , and we tried him in my bedroom , and fined him properly .
just to show you how demoralized the brute must have been ( arabs often go <name> after a defeat ) , he 'd snapped up four or five utterly useless <unk> , and was offering 'em to all and sundry along the road .
why , he offered 'em to you , did n't he , imam din ? "
" i was witness that he offered <unk> ' for sale , " said imam din .
" luckily for my <unk> , that landed , him both ways .
you see , he had <unk> and exposed slaves for sale in british territory .
that meant the double fine if i could get it out of him . "
" what was his defence ? "
said strickland , late of the punjab police .
" as far as i remember  but i had a temperature of 104 degrees at the time  he 'd mistaken the <unk> of longitude .
thought he was in french territory .
said he 'd never do it again , if we 'd let him off with a fine .
i could have shaken hands with the brute for that .
he paid up cash like a <unk> and went off one time . "
" did you see him ? "
" ye-es .
did n't i , imam din ? "
" assuredly the sahib both saw and spoke to the slaver .
and the sahib also made a speech to the <unk> when he freed them , and they swore to supply him with labour for all his <unk> .
the sahib leaned on his own servant 's shoulder the while . "
" i remember something of that .
i remember <unk> ram giving me the papers to sign , and i distinctly remember him locking up the money in the safe  two hundred and ten beautiful english sovereigns .
you don't know what that meant to me !
i believe it cured my fever ; and as soon as i could , i staggered off with the hajji to interview the <unk> about labour .
then i found out why they had been so keen to work !
it was n't gratitude .
their big village had been hit by lightning and burned out a week or two before , and they lay flat in rows around me asking me for a job .
i gave it 'em . "
" and so you were very happy ? "
his mother had stolen up behind us .
" you liked your cotton , dear ? "
she <unk> the lump away .
" by jove , i was happy ! "
<name> yawned .
" now if any one , " he looked at the infant , " cares to put a little money into the scheme , it 'll be the making of my district .
i ca n't give you figures , sir , but i assure  " " you 'll take your arsenic , and imam din 'll take you up to bed , and i'll come and tuck you in . "
<name> leaned forward , her rounded elbows on his shoulders , hands joined across his dark hair , and " is n't he a darling ? "
she said to us , with just the same <unk> lift to the left eyebrow and the same break of her voice as sent strickland mad among the horses in the year <unk> .
we were quiet when they were gone .
we waited till imam din returned to us from above and coughed at the door , as only <unk> <name> can .
" now , " said strickland , " tell us what truly befell , son of my servant . "
" all befell as our sahib has said .
only  only there was an arrangement  a little arrangement on account of his <unk> . "
" tell !
sit !
i beg your pardon , infant , " said strickland .
but the infant had already made the sign , and we heard imam din hunker down on the floor : one gets little out of the east at attention .
" when the fever came on our sahib in our roofed house at dupe , " he began , " the hajji listened intently to his talk .
he expected the names of women ; though i had already told him that our virtue was beyond belief or compare , and that our sole <name> was this <unk> .
being at last convinced , the hajji breathed on our sahib 's forehead , to sink into his <name> news concerning a <unk> in his district who had made a mock of the law .
sahib , " imam din turned to strickland , " our sahib answered to those false words as a horse of blood answers to the spur .
he sat up .
he issued orders for the apprehension of the <unk> .
then he fell back .
then we left him . "
" alone  servant of my son , and son of my servant ? "
said his father .
" there was an old woman which belonged to the hajji .
she had come in with the hajji 's <unk> .
the hajji told her that if our sahib died , she would die with him .
and truly our sahib had given me orders to depart . "
" being mad with fever  eh ? "
" what could we do , sahib ?
this <unk> was his heart 's <name> .
he talked of it in his fever .
therefore it was his heart 's <name> that the hajji went to fetch .
doubtless the hajji could have given him money enough out of hand for ten <unk> ; but in this respect also our sahib 's virtue was beyond belief or compare .
great ones do not exchange moneys .
therefore the hajji said  and i helped with my counsel  that we must make arrangements to get the money in all respects conformable with the english law .
it was great trouble to us , but  the law is the law .
and the hajji showed the old woman the knife by which she would die if our sahib died .
so i accompanied the hajji . "
" knowing who he was ? "
said strickland .
" no !
fearing the man .
a virtue went out from him overbearing the virtue of lesser persons .
the hajji told <unk> ram the clerk to occupy the seat of government at dupe till our return .
<unk> ram feared the hajji , because the hajji had often <unk> <unk> his skill in figures at five thousand rupees upon any <unk> .
the hajji then said to me : 'come , and we <name> make the <unk> play the <unk> for my delight 's delight ' the hajji loved our sahib with the love of a father for his son , of a saved for his saviour , of a great one for a great one .
but i said : 'we can not go to that <unk> place without a hundred rifles .
we have here five . '
the hajji said : 'i have untied as knot in my <unk> which <name> be more to us than a thousand . '
i saw that he had so loosed it that it lay <unk> on his shoulder .
then i knew that he was a great one with virtue in him .
" we came to the highlands of the <unk> on the <name> of the second day  about the time of the stirring of the cold wind .
the hajji walked delicately across the open place where their filth is , and scratched upon the gate which was shut .
when it opened i saw the <unk> lying on their cots under the eaves of the huts .
they rolled off : they rose up , one behind the other the length of the street , and the fear on their faces was as leaves <unk> to a breeze .
the hajji stood in the gate guarding his skirts from <unk> .
the hajji said : 'i am here once again .
give me six and yoke up . '
they zealously then pushed to us with poles six , and yoked them with a heavy tree .
the hajji then said : <unk> fire from the morning hearth , and come to windward . '
the wind is strong on those headlands at sunrise , so when each had emptied his <unk> of fire in front of that which was before him , the broadside of the town roared into flame , and all went .
the hajji then said : 'at the end of a time there <name> come here the white man ye once chased for sport .
he <name> demand labour to plant such and such stuff .
ye are that labour , and your spawn after you . '
they said , lifting their heads a very little from the edge of the ashes : 'we are that labour , and our spawn after us . '
the hajji said : 'what is also my name ? '
they said : 'thy name is also the merciful ' the hajji said : <unk> then my <name> ' ; and while they did this , the hajji walked away , i following . "
the infant made some noise in his throat , and reached for more burgundy .
" about noon one of our six fell dead .
fright only <unk> sahib !
none had  none could  touch him .
since they were in pairs , and the other of the fork was mad and sang foolishly , we waited for some heathen to do what was needful .
there came at last <unk> men with goats .
the hajji said : 'what do ye see ?
they said : 'oh , our lord , we neither see nor hear . '
the hajji said : 'but i command ye to see and to hear and to say . '
they said : 'oh , our lord , it is to our commanded eyes as though slaves stood in a fork . '
the hajji said : 'so testify before the officer who waits you in the town of dupe . '
they said : 'what shall come to us after ? '
the hajji said : 'the just reward for the <unk> .
but if ye do not testify , then a punishment which shall cause birds , to fall from the trees in terror and monkeys to scream for pity . '
hearing this , the <unk> men hastened to dupe .
the hajji then said to me : 'are those things sufficient to establish our case , or must i drive in a village full ? '
i said that three witnesses amply established any case , but as yet , i said , the hajji had not offered his slaves for sale .
it is true , as our sahib said just now , there is one fine for catching slaves , and yet another for making to sell them .
and it was the double fine that we needed , sahib , for our sahib 's <unk> .
we had <unk> all this with <unk> ram , who knows the english law , and , i thought the hajji remembered , but he grew angry , and cried out : 'o god , refuge of the afflicted , must i , who am what i am , <unk> this dog 's meat by the roadside to gain his delight for my heart 's delight ? '
none the less , he admitted it was the english law , and so he offered me the six  five  in a small voice , with an averted head .
the <unk> do not smell of sour milk as heathen should .
they smell like <unk> , sahib .
this is because they eat men . "
" maybe , " said strickland .
" but where were thy wits ?
one witness is not sufficient to establish the fact of a sale . "
" what could we do , sahib ?
there was the hajji 's reputation to consider .
we could not have called in a heathen witness for such a thing .
and , moreover , the sahib forgets that the defendant himself was making this case .
he would not contest his own evidence .
otherwise , i know the law of evidence well enough .
" so then we went to dupe , and while <unk> ram waited among the <unk> men , 'i ran to see our sahib in bed .
his eyes were very bright , and his mouth was full of upside-down orders , but the old woman had not loosened her hair for death .
the hajji said : 'be quick with my trial .
i am not job ! '
the hajji was a learned man .
we made the trial swiftly to a sound of soothing voices round the bed .
yet  yet , because no man can be sure whether a sahib of that blood sees , or does not see , we made it strictly in the manner of the forms of the english law .
only the witnesses and the slaves and the prisoner we kept without for his nose 's sake . "
" then he did not see the prisoner ? "
said strickland .
" i stood by to <unk> up an <unk> in case he should demand it , but by god 's favour he was too far fevered to ask for one .
it is quite true he signed the papers .
it is quite true he saw the money put away in the safe  two hundred and ten english pounds and it is quite true that the gold wrought on him as a strong cure .
but as to his seeing the prisoner , and having speech with the <unk>  the hajji breathed all that on his forehead to sink into his sick <name> .
a little , as ye have heard , has remained ... . ah , but when the fever broke , and our sahib called for the <unk> , and the thin little <unk> from europe with the pictures of ploughs and <unk> , and <unk>  ah , then he laughed as he used to laugh , sahib .
it was his heart 's <name> , this <unk> .
the hajji loved him , as who does not ?
it was a little , little arrangement , sahib , of which  is it necessary to tell all the world ? "
" and when didst thou know who the hajji was ? "
said strickland .
" not for a certainty till he and our sahib had returned from their visit to the <unk> country .
it is quite true as our sahib says , the <unk> lay , flat around his feet , and asked for spades to cultivate cotton .
that very night , when i was cooking the dinner , the hajji said to me : 'i go to my own place , though god knows whether the man with the stone eyes have left me an ox , a slave , or a woman . '
i said : 'thou <name> then that one ? '
the hajji said : 'i am ten thousand rupees reward into thy hand .
shall we make another <unk> and get more cotton machines for the boy ? '
i said : 'what dog am i to do this ?
may god prolong thy life a thousand years ! '
the hajji said : 'who has seen to-morrow ?
god has given me as it were a son in my old age , and i praise him .
see that the breed is not lost ! '
" he walked then from the <unk> to our sahib 's <unk> under the tree , where our sahib held in his hand a blue envelope of service newly come in by runner from the north .
at this , fearing evil news for the hajji , i would have restrained him , but he said : 'we be both great ones .
neither of us <name> fail . '
our sahib looked up to invite the hajji to approach before he opened the letter , but the hajji stood off till our sahib had well opened and well read the letter .
then the hajji said : 'is it permitted to say farewell ? '
our sahib stabbed the letter on the file with a deep and joyful breath and cried a welcome .
the hajji said : 'i go to my own place , ' and he loosed from his neck a chained heart of <unk> set in soft gold and held it forth .
our sahib snatched it swiftly in the closed fist , down turned , and said 'if thy name be written <unk> , it is needless , for a name is already engraved on my heart . '
the hajji said : 'and on mine also is a name engraved ; but there is no name on the amulet . '
the hajji stooped to our sahib 's feet , but our sahib raised and embraced him , and the hajji covered his mouth with his <unk> , because it worked , and so he went away . "
" and what order was in the service letter ? "
stalky murmured .
" only an order for our sahib to write a report on some new cattle sickness .
but all orders come in the same make of envelope .
we could not tell what order it might have been . "
" when he opened the letter  my son  made he no sign ?
a cough ?
an oath ? "
strickland asked .
" none , sahib .
i watched his hands .
they did not shake .
afterward he wiped his face , but he was sweating before from the heat . "
" did he know ?
did he know who the hajji was ? "
said the infant in english .
" i am a poor man .
who can say what a sahib of that get knows or does not know ?
but the hajji is right .
the breed should not be lost .
it is not very hot for little children in dupe , and as regards nurses , my <unk> cousin at <unk>  " " h 'm !
that is the boy 's own concern .
i wonder if his chief ever knew ? "
said strickland .
" assuredly , " said imam din .
" on the night before our sahib went down to the sea , the great sahib  the man with the stone eyes  dined with him in his camp , i being in charge of the table .
they talked a long while and the great sahib said : 'what didst thou think of that one ? '
( we do not say <unk> <unk> yonder . )
our sahib said : 'which one ? '
the great sahib said : 'that one which taught thy <unk> to grow cotton for thee .
he was in thy district three months to my certain knowledge , and i looked by every runner that thou wouldst send me in his head . '
our sahib said : 'if his head had been needed , another man should have been appointed to govern my district , for he was my friend . '
the great sahib laughed and said : 'if i had needed a lesser man in thy place be sure i would have sent him , as , if i had needed the head of that one , be sure i would have sent men to bring it to me .
but tell me now , by what means didst thou twist him to thy use and our profit in this <unk> ? '
our sahib said : 'by god , i did not use that man in any fashion whatever .
he was my friend . '
the great sahib said : <unk> <unk> !
( bosh ! )
tell ! '
our sahib shook his head as he does  as he did when a child  and they looked at each other like <unk> men in the ring at a fair .
the great sahib dropped his eyes first and he said : 'so be it .
i should perhaps have answered thus in my youth .
no matter .
i have made treaty with that one as an ally of the state .
some day he shall tell me the tale . '
then i brought in fresh coffee , and they ceased .
but i do not think that one <name> tell the great sahib more than our sahib told him . "
" wherefore ? "
i asked .
" because they are both great ones , and i have observed in my life that great ones employ words very little between each other in their dealings ; still less when they speak to a third concerning those dealings .
also they profit by silence ... . now i think that the mother has come down from the room , and i <name> go rub his feet till he sleeps . "
his ears had caught <name> 's step at the <unk> and presently she passed us on her way to the music room humming the <unk> .
the new knighthood who gives him the bath ?
" i , " said the wet , rank <unk> , " i 'll give him the bath ! "
who 'll sing the <unk> ?
" we , " said the palms .
" ere the hot wind <unk> , we 'll sing the <unk> . "
who lays on the sword ?
" i , " said the sun , " before he has done , i 'll lay on the sword . "
who <unk> his belt ?
" i , " said <unk> , " i know all the fashions of tightening a belt ! "
who buckles his spur ?
" i , " said his chief , exacting and brief , " i 'll give him the spur . "
who 'll shake his hand ?
" i , " said the fever , " and i 'm no <unk> , i 'll shake his hand . "
who brings him the wine ?
" i , " said quinine , " it 's a habit of mine , i 'll come with his wine . "
who 'll put him to proof ?
" i , " said all earth , " whatever he 's worth , i 'll put to the proof . "
who 'll choose him for knight ?
" i , " said his mother , " before any other , my very own knight ! "
and after this fashion , adventure to seek , was sir <unk> made  as it might be last week !
the <unk> i had not seen penfentenyou since the middle <unk> , when he was minister of ways and <unk> in de <unk> 's first administration .
last summer , though he nominally held the same portfolio , he was his <unk> premier in all but name , and the idol of his own province , which is two and a half times the size of england .
politically , his creed was his growing country ; and he came over to england to develop a great idea in her behalf .
believing that he had put it in train , i made haste to welcome him to my house for a week .
that he was chased to my door by his own agent-general in a motor ; that they turned my study into a cabinet meeting which i was not invited to attend ; that the local telegraph all but broke down beneath the strain of hundred word <unk> cables ; and that i practically broke into the house of a stranger to get him <unk> facilities on a <name> , are things i overlook .
what i objected to was his ingratitude , while i thus tore up england to help him .
so i said : " why on earth did n't you see your opposite number in town instead of bringing your office work here ? "
" eh ?
who ? "
said he , looking up from his fourth cable since lunch .
" see the english minister for ways and <unk> . "
" i saw him , " said penfentenyou , without enthusiasm .
it seemed that he had called twice on the gentleman , but without an appointment  ( " i thought if i was n't big enough , my business was " )  and each time had found him engaged .
a third party intervening , suggested that a meeting might be arranged if due notice were given .
" then , " said penfentenyou , " i called at the office at ten o'clock . "
" but they 'd be in bed , " i cried .
" one of the babies was awake .
he told me that  that 'my sort of questions " '  he slapped the pile of cables  " were only taken between 11 and 2 <unk> .
so i waited . "
" and when you got to business ? "
i asked .
he made a gesture of despair .
" it was like talking to children .
they'd never heard of it . "
" and your opposite number ? "
penfentenyou described him .
" hush !
you must n't talk like that ! "
i shuddered .
" he 's one of the best of good fellows .
you should meet him socially . "
" i 've done that too , " he said .
" have you ? "
" heaven forbid ! "
i cried ; " but that 's the proper thing to say . "
" oh , he said all the proper things .
only i thought as this was england that they 'd more or less have the <name> of all the  general <unk> of my idea .
but i had to explain it from the beginning . "
" ah !
they 'd probably mislaid the papers , " i said , and i told him the story of a <unk> pound insurrection caused by a deputy <unk> sitting upon a mass of <unk> correspondence instead of reading it .
" i wonder it does n't happen every week , " the answered .
" d'you mind my having the agent-general to dinner again tonight ?
i 'll wire , and he can motor down . "
the agent-general arrived two hours later , a patient and <unk> person , visibly torn between the pulling devil of a rampant colony , and the placid baker of a largely <unk> england .
but with penfentenyou behind him he had worked ; for he told us that lord lundie  the law lord was the final authority on the legal and constitutional aspects of the great idea , and to him it must be referred .
" good heavens alive ! "
thundered penfentenyou .
" i told you to get that settled last christmas . "
" it was the middle of the <unk> season , " said the agent-general mildly .
" lord lundie 's at <unk> green now  he spends his holidays there .
it 's only forty miles off . "
" <name> n't i disturb his holiness ? "
said penfentenyou heavily .
" perhaps 'my sort of questions , " ' he snorted , " may n't be discussed except at midnight . "
" oh , do n't be a child , " i said .
" what this country needs , " said penfentenyou , " is  " and for ten minutes he trumpeted rebellion .
" what you need is to pay for your own protection , " i cut in when he <name> breath , and i showed him a yellowish paper , supplied gratis by government , which is called schedule d. to my merciless delight he had never seen the thing before , and i completed my victory over him and all the colonies with a <unk> 's " naval annual " and a " statesman 's year book . "
the agent-general interposed with <unk> ( but they were merely <unk> ) about ties of sentiment .
" they be blowed ! "
said penfentenyou .
" what 's the good of sentiment towards a <unk> ? "
" quite so .
ties of common funk are the things that bind us together ; and the sooner you new nations realize it the better .
what you need is an annual invasion .
then you 'd grow up . "
" thank you !
thank you ! "
said the agent-general .
" that 's what i am always trying to tell my people . "
" but , my dear fool , " penfentenyou almost wept , " do you pretend that these <unk> amateurs at home are grown up ? "
" you poor , serious , pagan man , " i retorted , " if you take 'em that way , you 'll wreck your great idea . "
" <name> you take him to lord lundie 's to-morrow ? "
said the agent-general promptly .
" i suppose i must , " i said , " if you wo n't . "
" not me !
i 'm going home , " said the agent-general , and departed .
i am glad that i am no colony 's agent-general .
penfentenyou continued to argue about naval contributions till <unk> a.m. , though i was <name> from the first .
at ten o'clock i got him and his correspondence into the motor , and he had the decency to ask whether he had been <unk> <unk> .
i replied that i waited an apology .
this he made excuse for renewed arguments , and used wayside shows as illustrations of the <unk> of england .
for example we burst a tyre within a mile of <unk> green , and , to save time , walked into the beautifully kept little village .
his eye was caught by a building of pale-blue tin , <unk> " <unk> chapel , " before whose shuttered windows an italian <unk> with a <unk> monkey was playing " <name> grey " " yes .
that 's it ! "
snapped the <unk> .
" that 's a parable of the general situation in england .
and look at those brutes ! "
a huge household <unk> van was halted at a <unk> .
the men in charge were drinking beer from blue and white <unk> .
it seemed to me a pretty sight , but penfentenyou said it represented our national attitude .
lord lundie 's summer resting-place we learned was a farm , a little out of the village , up a hill round which curled a high hedged road .
only an initiated few spend their holidays at <unk> green , and they have trained the <unk> to keep the place select .
penfentenyou made a grievance of this as we walked up the <name> , followed at a distance by the <unk> .
" suppose he is having a <unk> , " he said : " anything 's possible in this insane land . "
just at that minute we found ourselves opposite an empty villa .
its roof was of black slate , with bright <unk> <unk> ; its walls were of <unk> brick , cornered and banded with <unk> <unk> work , and there was cobalt , <unk> , and purest <unk> <unk> on either side of the front door .
the whole was fenced from the road by a low , <unk> , flint wall , topped with a cast-iron gothic rail , picked out in blue and gold .
tight beds of geranium , calceolaria , and lobelia speckled the <unk> , from whose centre rose one of the finest <unk> ( its other name by the way is " <unk> " ) , that it has ever been my lot to see .
it must have been full thirty feet high , and its foliage exquisitely answered the iron railings .
such <unk> ne plus <unk> , replete with all the <unk> , do not , as i pointed out to penfentenyou , <unk> outside of england .
a hedge , swinging sharp right , flanked the garden , and above it on a slope of <unk> meadows we could see lord lundie 's tiled and <unk> summer farmhouse .
of a sudden we heard voices behind the tree  the fine full tones of the unembarrassed english , speaking to their equals  that tore through the hedge like sleet through rafters .
" that it is not called <unk> ' for nothing , i willingly concede "  this was a <name> and rolling note  " but on the other hand  " " i submit , me <unk> , that the name implies that it might , could , would , or should be ascended by a monkey , and not that the ascent is a physical impossibility .
i believe one of our south american spider monkeys would n't hesitate ... by jove , it might be worth trying , if  " this was a <unk> voice than the first .
a third , <unk> , and full of pleasant <unk> , broke in .
" oh , practical men , there is no ape here .
why do you waste one of god's own days on unprofitable discussion ?
give me a match ! "
" i 've a good mind to make you demonstrate in your own person .
come on , bubbles !
we 'll make <name> climb ! "
there was a sound of scuffling , broken by <unk> from <name> of the high voice .
i turned back and <name> penfentenyou into the side of the <unk> hedge .
i remembered to have read in a society paper that lord <unk> lesser name was " bubbles . "
" what are they doing ? "
penfentenyou said sharply .
" drunk ? "
" just playing !
<unk> vitality of the race , you know .
we 'll watch 'em , " i answered .
the noise ceased .
" my deliver , " <name> gasped .
" the ram caught in the thicket , and  i 'm the only one who can talk neapolitan !
<unk> my collar ! "
he cried aloud in a foreign tongue , and was answered from the gate .
" it 's the <unk> <unk> , " i whispered .
i had already found a practicable break at the bottom of the hedge .
" they 're going to try to make the monkey climb , i believe . "
" here  let me look ! "
penfentenyou flung himself down , and rooted till he too broke a <unk> .
we lay side by side commanding the entire garden at ten yards ' range .
" you know 'em ? "
said penfentenyou , as i made some noise or other .
" by sight only .
the big fellow in <unk> is lord lundie ; the <unk> one with the yellow beard painted his picture at the last academy : he 's a swell <unk> , <name> <unk> . "
" and the brown chap with the hands ? "
" <unk> , sir <name> <unk> , the south american engineer who built the  " " san <name> <unk> .
i know , " said penfentenyou .
" we ought to have had him with us ... . do you think a monkey would climb the tree ? "
the <unk> at the gate fenced his beast with one arm as <unk> .
" do n't show off your futile accomplishments , " said lord lundie .
" tell him it 's an experiment .
interest him ! "
" shut up , bubbles .
you are n't in court , " <name> replied .
" this needs delicacy .
<name> says  " " interest the monkey , " the brown engineer interrupted .
" he wo n't climb for love .
cut up to the house and get some biscuits , bubbles  sugar ones and an orange or two .
no need to tell our womenfolk . "
the huge white figure <unk> off at a trot which would not have disgraced a boy of seventeen .
i gathered from something <name> let fall that the three had been at harrow together .
" that <unk> has a head on his shoulders , " muttered penfentenyou .
" pity we did n't get him for the colony .
but the question is , <name> the monkey climb ? "
" be quick , <name> .
tell the man we 'll give him five <name> for the <name> of the beast .
now run the organ under the tree , and we 'll dress it when bubbles comes back , " sir <name> cried .
" i 've often wondered , " said penfentenyou , " whether it would puzzle a monkey ? "
he had forgotten the needs of his growing nation , and was earnestly parting the <unk> stems with his fingers .
* * * * * * * * * * <name> and <name> did as they were told , the monkey following them with a wary and malignant eye .
" here 's a discovery , " said <name> .
" the singing part of this organ comes off the wheels . "
he spoke <unk> to the proprietor .
" oh , it 's so as <name> can take it to his room o ' nights .
and play it .
d'you hear that ?
the <unk> , after his day 's crime , plays his accursed machine for love .
for love , <name> !
and <name> <name> was one of 'em ! "
" do n't jaw !
tell him to take the beast 's petticoat off , " said sir <name> <unk> .
lord lundie returned , very little winded , through a gap higher up the hedge .
" they 're all out , thank goodness ! "
he cried , " but i 've <unk> what i could .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> fruit , and a bag of oranges . "
" excellent ! "
said the <unk> contractor .
" <name> , you 're the <unk> ; jump up on the organ and <unk> these things on the leaves as i hand 'em ! "
" i see , " said <name> , capering like a <unk> .
" upward and onward , eh ?
first , he 'll reach out for  how infernal prickly these leaves are !  this biscuit .
next we 'll lure him on  ( that 's about the reach of his arm )  with the <unk> glare , and then he 'll open out this orange .
how human !
how like your ignoble career , bubbles ! "
with care and elaboration they ornamented that tree 's lower branches with <unk> biscuits , oranges , bits of banana , and <unk> <unk> till it looked very ape 's path to paradise .
" <unk> the <unk> ! "
said sir <name> <unk> .
<name> placed the monkey atop of the organ , where the beast , misunderstanding , stood on his head .
" he 's throwing himself on the <name> of the court , me <unk> , " said <name> .
" no  now he 's interested .
now he 's reaching after higher things .
what would n't i give to have here " ( he mentioned a name not <unk> in british <name> ) .
" ambition plucking apples of sodom ! "
( the monkey had pricked himself and was swearing ) .
" genius hampered by convention ?
oh , there 's a whole <unk> of <unk> in it ! "
" give him time .
he 's balancing the probabilities , " said lord lundie .
the three closed round the monkey ,  hanging on his every motion with an earnestness almost equal to ours .
the great judge 's head  seamed and vertical forehead , iron mouth , and <unk> <unk> , all set on that thick neck rising out of the white <unk> collar  was thrown against the puckered green silk of the <unk> as it might have been a <unk> of <name> .
<name> , with raised eyes and parted lips , fingered his grizzled chestnut beard , and i was near enough <unk> , the capable beauty of his hands .
sir <name> stood a little apart , his arms folded behind his back , one heavy brown boot thrust forward , <name> in as <unk> , and black eyebrows lowered to shade the keen eyes .
<name> 's dark face between flashing earrings , a twisted rag of red and yellow silk round his throat , turned from the reaching yearning monkey to the pink and white biscuits spiked on the bronzed <unk> .
and upon them all fell the serious and <unk> sun of an english summer forenoon .
" <unk> de saint <name> , <unk> au <unk> ! "
said lord lundie suddenly in a voice that made me think of black caps .
i do not know what the monkey thought , because at that instant he leaped off the organ and disappeared .
there was a clash of broken glass behind the tree .
the monkey 's face , distorted with passion , appeared at an upper window of the house , and a starred hole in the <unk> window to the left of 'the front door showed the first steps of his upward path .
" we 've got to catch him , " cried sir <name> .
" come along ! "
they pushed at the door , which was unlocked .
" yes .
but consider the ethics of the case , " said <name> .
" is n't this burglary or something , bubbles ? "
" settle that when he 's caught , " said sir <name> .
" we 're responsible for the beast . "
a furious clanging of bells broke out of the empty house , followed by <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
" what the deuce is that ? "
i asked , half aloud .
" the <unk> , of course , " said penfentenyou .
" what a pity !
i believe he 'd have climbed if lord lundie had n't put him off ! "
" wait a moment , <name> , " said <name> the interpreter ; " <unk> says he may answer to the music of his infancy .
<name> , therefore , <name> go in with the organ .
<unk> with his <unk> , you know .
<unk> , <unk> !
there 's no neapolitan for bathroom , but i fancy your friend is there . "
" i 'm not going into another man 's house with a <unk> , " said lord lundie , <unk> , as <name> <unk> the working mechanism of the organ ( it developed a <unk> leg ) from its wheels , slipped a strap round his shoulders , and gave the handle a twist .
" do n't be a cad , bubbles , " was <name> 's answer .
" you could n't leave us now if you were on the <unk> .
play , <unk> !
the <unk> accompanies . "
* * * * * * * * * with a whoop , a buzz , and a crash , the organ sprang to life under the hand of <name> , and the procession passed through the <unk> front door .
a moment later we saw the monkey <unk> on the roof .
" he 'll be all over the township in a minute if we do n't head him , " said penfentenyou , leaping to his feet , and crashing into the garden .
we headed him with pebbles till he retired through a window to the <unk> reminder that he had left a lot of little things behind him .
as we passed the front door it swung open , and showed <name> the artist sitting at the bottom of a <unk> staircase .
he <unk> his hands at us , and when we entered we saw that the man was stricken speechless .
his eyes grew red  red like a ferret 's  and what little breath he had whistled shrilly .
at first we thought it was a fit , and then we saw that it was mirth  the <unk> mirth of the artistic temperament .
the house <unk> to an infamous <name> <unk> by the stump of the <unk> 's one leg , as <name> , above , moved from room to room after his rebel slave .
now and again a floor shook a little under the combined rushes of lord lundie and sir <name> <unk> , who gave many and contradictory orders .
but when they could they cursed <name> with splendid thoroughness .
" have you anything to do with the house ? "
panted <name> at last .
" because we 're using it just now . "
he gulped .
" and i 'm ah  keeping cave . "
" all right , " said penfentenyou , and shut the hall door .
" <name> , you unspeakable blackguard , <name> , you cur !
you coward ! "
( lord lundie 's voice <unk> the flood of <name> . )
" come up here !
<unk> 's saying something we do n't understand . "
<name> listened and interpreted between <unk> .
" he says you 'd better play the organ , bubbles , and let him do the stalking .
the monkey knows him . "
" by jove , he 's quite right , " said sir <name> from the landing .
" take it , bubbles , at once . "
" my god ! "
said lord lundie in horror .
the <name> <unk> over our heads , from the <unk> to the first floor and back again .
bodies and voices met in collision and argument , and once or twice the organ hit walls and doors .
then it broke forth in a new manner .
" he 's playing it , " said <name> .
" i know his acute <unk> ear .
are you fond of music ? "
" i think lord lundie plays very well for a beginner , " i ventured .
" ah !
that 's the trained legal intellect .
like <unk> a brief .
i have n't got it . "
he wiped his eyes and shook .
" hi ! "
said penfentenyou , looking through the stained glass window down the garden .
" what 's that ! "
* * * * * * * * * a household <unk> van , in charge of four men , had halted at the gate .
a husband and his wife <unk> beyond question  <unk> irresolutely up the path .
he looked tired .
she was certainly cross .
in all this haphazard world the last couple to understand a scientific experiment .
i laid hands on <name>  the clamour above drowning speech and with penfentenyou 's aid , propped him against the window , that he should see .
he saw , nodded , fell as an umbrella can fall , and kneeling , beat his forehead on the shut door .
penfentenyou slid the bolt .
the furniture men reinforced the two figures on the path , and advanced , spreading generously .
" had n't we better warn them up-stairs ? "
i suggested : " no .
i 'll die first ! "
said <name> .
" i 'm pretty near it now .
besides , they called me names . "
i turned from the artist to the administrator .
" <unk> <unk> , i think we 'd better be going , " said penfentenyou , dealer in crises .
" <name>  take me with you , " said <name> .
" i 've no reputation to lose , but i'd like to watch 'em from  er  outside the picture . "
" there 's always a modus <unk> , " penfentenyou murmured , and tiptoed along the hall to a back door , which he opened quite silently .
we passed into a tangle of gooseberry bushes where , at his <unk> example , we crawled on all fours , and regained the hedge .
here we lay up , secure in our <unk> .
" but your firm , "  the woman was wailing to the furniture <unk> men  " your firm promised me everything should be in yesterday .
and it's to-day !
you should have been here yesterday ! "
" the last tenants ai n't out yet , <unk> , " said one of them .
lord lundie was rapidly improving in <unk> , though <unk> , unlike the law , is more of a calling than a trade , and he <name> occasionally on a dead centre .
<name> , i think , was singing , but i could not understand the drift of sir <name> 's remarks .
they were spanish .
the woman said something we did not catch .
" you might 'ave <unk> it , " the man insisted .
" or your gentleman 'ere might . "
" but i did n't .
send for the police at once . "
" i would n't do that , <unk> .
they 're only fruit <unk> on a <unk> .
they are n't particular where they sleep . "
" d'you mean they 've been sleeping there ?
i only had it cleaned last week .
get them out . "
" oh , if you say so , we 'll 'ave 'em out of it in two twos .
alf , fetch me the spare <unk> . "
" do n't !
you 'll knock the paint off the door .
get them out ! "
" what the <unk> else am i trying to do for you , <unk> ? "
the man answered with pathos ; but the woman wheeled on her mate .
" <name> !
they 're all drunk here , and they 're all mad there .
do something ! "
she said .
<name> took one short step forward , and sighed " hullo ! "
in the direction of the turbulent house .
the woman walked up and down , the very figure of domestic tragedy .
the furniture men swayed a little on their heels , and  " got him ! "
the shout rang through all the windows at once .
it was followed by a <unk> bay from sir <name> , a <unk> <unk> on the organ , and loud cries , for <name> .
but <name> , at my side , rolled his <unk> eyeballs , <unk> .
" i never knew them , " he said .
" i 'm an orphan . "
* * * * * * * * * the front , door opened , and the three came forth to short-lived triumph .
i had never before seen a law lord dressed as for tennis , with a <unk> <unk> strapped to his shoulder .
but it is a shy bird in this plumage .
lord lundie strove to <unk> himself of his accoutrements much as an <unk> punch and <name> dog tries to escape backwards through his <unk> collar .
sir <name> , covered with <unk> , cherished a bleeding thumb , and the almost crazy monkey tore at <name> 's hair .
the men on both sides reeled , but the woman stood her ground .
" idiots ! "
she said , and once more , " idiots ! "
i could have <unk> a few convicts of my acquaintance with a photograph of lord lundie at that instant .
" madam , " he began , wonderfully preserving the roll in his voice , " it was a monkey . "
sir <name> sucked his thumb and nodded .
" take it away and go , " she replied .
" go away ! "
i would have gone , and gladly , on this permission , but these still strong men must ever be <unk> themselves .
lord lundie turned to the husband , who for the first time spoke .
" i have rented this house .
i am moving in , " he said .
" we ought to have been in yesterday , " the woman interrupted .
" yes .
we ought to have been in yesterday .
have you slept there overnight ? "
said the man <unk> .
" no ; i assure you we have n't , " said lord lundie .
" then go away .
go quite away , " cried the woman .
they went  in single file down the path .
they went silently , <unk> the organ on its wheels , and <unk> the monkey to the organ .
" damn it all ! "
said penfentenyou .
" they do face the music , and they do stick by each other in private life ! "
" ties of common funk , " i answered .
<name> ran to the gate and fled back to the possible world .
lord lundie and sir <name> , constrained by tradition , paced slowly .
then it came to pass that the woman , who walked behind them , lifted up her eyes , and beheld the tree which they had dressed .
" stop ! "
she called ; and they stopped .
" who did that ? "
there was no answer .
the eternal bad boy in every man <name> its head before the eternal mother in every woman .
" who put these disgusting things there ? "
she repeated .
suddenly penfentenyou , premier of his colony in all but name , left <name> and me , and appeared at the gate .
( if he is not turned out of office , that is how he <name> appear on the day of <unk> . )
" well done you ! "
he cried zealously , and <unk> his hat to the woman .
" have you any children , madam ? "
he demanded .
" yes , two .
they should have been here to-day .
the firm promised  " " then we 're not a minute too soon .
that monkey escaped .
it was a very dangerous beast .
'might have frightened your children into fits .
all the <unk> 's fault !
a most lucky thing these gentlemen caught it when they did .
i <name> you are n't badly mauled , sir <name> ? "
shaken as i was ( i wanted to get away and laugh ) i could not but admire the scoundrel 's consummate tact in leading his second highest trump .
an ass would have introduced lord lundie and they would not have believed him .
it took the trick .
the couple smiled , and gave respectful thanks for their deliverance by such hands from such perils .
" not in the least , " said lord lundie .
" anybody  any father would have done as much , and pray do n't apologize your mistake was quite natural . "
a furniture man <unk> here , and lord lundie rolled an eye of doom on their ranks .
" by the way , if you have trouble with these persons  they seem to have taken as much as is good for them  please let me know .
er  good morning ! "
they turned into the <name> .
" heavens ! "
said <name> , brushing himself down .
" who 's that real man with the real head ? "
and we hurried after them , for they were running unsteadily , squeaking like rabbits as they ran .
we overtook them in a little nut wood half a mile up the road , where they had turned aside , and were rolling .
so we rolled with them , and ceased not till we had arrived at the extremity of exhaustion .
" you  you saw it all , then ? "
said lord lundie , <unk> his <unk> collar .
" i saw it was a vital question from the first , " responded penfentenyou , and blew his nose .
" it was .
by the way , d'you mind telling me your name ? "
<unk> .
penfentenyou 's great idea has gone through , a little chipped at the edges , but in fine and far-reaching shape .
his opposite number worked at it like a mule  a bewildered mule , beaten from behind , coaxed from in front , and propped on either soft side by lord lundie of the compressed mouth and the <unk> tongue .
sir <name> <unk> has been <unk> from the <unk> , where , after all , he was but preparing <unk> for hostile peoples , and now <unk> the <unk> of penfentenyou 's <unk> board .
this was an unforeseen extra , as was <name> 's gratis <unk>  ( it <name> be in this year 's academy ) of penfentenyou , who has returned to his own place .
now and again , from afar off , between the slam and bump of his shifting scenery , the glare of his <unk> <unk> , and the controlled rolling of his <unk> , i catch his voice , lifted in encouragement and advice to his <unk> .
he is quite sound on ties of sentiment , and  alone of colonial statesmen ventures to talk of the ties of common funk .
herein i have my reward .
the <unk> the <unk> in all his <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , his mental processes are plain  one knows what he <name> do , and can logically predicate his finish by his start : but the english  ah , the english !  they are quite a race apart .
their psychology is <unk> , their outlook crude and rare ; they abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw ; but the straw that they were tickled with  the chaff that they were fed with  they convert into a weaver 's beam to break their <unk> 's head with .
for <unk> reasons and for motives not of state , they arrive at their conclusions  largely inarticulate .
being void of <unk> they confide their views to none ; but sometimes , in a smoking-room , one learns why things were done .
in telegraphic sentences , half swallowed at the ends , they hint a matter 's <unk>  and there the matter ends .
and while the <unk> is talking from <name> to <unk> , the english  ah , the english !  do n't say anything at all !
little foxes a tale of the gihon hunt a fox came out of his earth on the banks of the great river gihon , which waters <unk> .
he saw a white man riding through the dry <unk> , and , that his <name> might be fulfilled , barked at him .
the rider <name> rein among the villagers round his stirrup .
" what , " said he , " is that ? "
" that , " said the sheikh of the village , " is a fox , o excellency our governor . "
" it is not , then , a jackal ? "
" no jackal , but abu hussein the father of cunning . "
" also , " the white man spoke half aloud , " i am <unk> of this province . "
" it is true , " they cried .
" ya , <unk> el <unk> " ( o excellency our governor ) .
the great river gihon , well used to the moods of kings , slid between his <unk> banks toward the sea , while the governor praised god in a loud and searching cry never before heard by the river .
when he had lowered his right forefinger from behind his right ear , the villagers talked to him of their crops  barley , <unk> , millet , onions , and the like .
the governor stood in his stirrups .
north he looked up a strip of green cultivation a few hundred yards wide that lay like a carpet between the river and the <name> line of the desert .
sixty miles that strip stretched before him , and as many behind .
at every half-mile a groaning <unk> lifted the soft water from the river to the crops by way of a <unk> <unk> .
a foot or so wide was the <unk> ; five foot or more high was the bank on which it ran , and its base was broad in proportion .
abu hussein , <unk> the father of cunning , drank from the river below his earth , and his shadow was long in the low sun .
he could not understand the loud cry which the governor had cried .
the sheikh of the village spoke of the crops from which the rulers of all lands draw revenue ; but the governor 's eyes were fixed , between his horse 's ears , on the nearest <unk> .
" very like a ditch in ireland , " he murmured , and smiled , dreaming of a <unk> bank in distant <unk> .
encouraged by that smile , the sheikh continued .
" when crops fail it is necessary to <unk> taxation .
then it is a good thing , o excellency our governor , that you come and see the crops which have failed , and discover that we have not lied . "
" assuredly . "
the governor shortened his reins .
the horse cantered on , rose at the embankment of the <unk> , changed leg cleverly on top , and hopped down in a cloud of golden dust .
abu hussein from his earth watched with interest .
he had never before seen such things .
" assuredly , " the governor repeated , and came back by the way he had gone .
" it is always best to see for one 's self . "
an ancient and still <unk> <unk> steamer , with a barge lashed to her side , came round the river bend .
she whistled to tell the governor his dinner was ready , and the horse , seeing his fodder piled on the barge , <unk> back .
" moreover , " the sheikh added , " in the days of the oppression the <unk> and their creatures <unk> many people of their lands .
all up and down the river our people are waiting to return to their lawful fields . "
" judges have been appointed to settle that matter , " said the governor .
" they <name> presently come in steamers and hear the witnesses . "
" wherefore ?
did the judges kill the <unk> ?
we would rather be judged by the men who executed god 's judgment on the <unk> .
we would rather abide by your decision , o excellency our governor . "
the governor nodded .
it was a year since he had seen the <unk> stretched close and still round the reddened sheepskin where lay el <unk> , the prophet of god .
now there remained no trace of their dominion except the old steamer , once part of a dervish flotilla , which was his house and office .
she sidled into the shore , lowered a plank , and the governor followed his horse aboard .
lights burned on her till late , dully reflected in the river that tugged at her <unk> .
the governor read , not for the first time , the administration reports of one <name> <unk> , <unk> .
" we shall need , " he said suddenly to his inspector , " about ten couple .
i 'll get 'em when i go home .
you 'll be whip , baker ? "
the inspector , who was not yet twenty-five , signified his assent in the usual manner , while abu hussein barked at the vast desert moon .
" <name> ! "
said the governor , coming out in his pyjamas , " we 'll be giving you <unk> in another three months , my friend . "
* * * * * it was four , as a matter of fact , ere a steamer with a melodious <unk> of hounds anchored at that landing .
the inspector leaped down among them , and the homesick wanderers received him as a brother .
" everybody fed 'em everything on board ship , but they 're real dainty hounds at bottom , " the governor explained .
" that 's <name> you 've got hold of  the pick of the bunch  and the bitch that 's got , hold of you  she's a little excited  is may <name> .
<unk> , out of <unk> maudlin , you know . "
" i know .
<unk> old <unk> with the tan eyebrows , " ' the inspector cooed .
" oh , <name> !
i shall take an interest in life now .
hark to 'em !
o hark ! "
abu hussein , under the high bank , went about his night 's work .
an <name> carried his scent to the barge , and three villages heard the crash of music that followed .
even then abu hussein did not know better than to bark in reply .
" well , what about my province ? "
the governor asked .
" not so bad , " the inspector answered , with <name> 's head between his knees .
" of course , all the villages want <unk> of taxes , but , as far as i can see , the whole country 's <unk> ' with foxes .
our trouble <name> be <unk> ' 'em in cover .
i 've got a list of the only villages entitled to any <unk> .
what d'you call this <unk> , <unk> beast with the jowl ? "
" <unk> .
i have my doubts about him .
do you think we can get two days a week ? "
" easy ; and as many <unk> as you please .
the sheikh of this village here tells me that his barley has failed , and he wants a fifty per cent <unk> . "
" we 'll begin with him to-morrow , and look at his crops as we go .
nothing like personal supervision , " said the governor .
they began at sunrise .
the pack flew off the barge in every direction , and , after <unk> , dug like terriers at abu hussein 's many <unk> .
then they drank themselves <unk> on gihon water while the governor and the inspector <unk> them with whips .
scorpions were added ; for may <name> <unk> one , and was removed to the barge lamenting .
mystery ( a puppy , alas ! )
met a snake , and the <unk> <unk> ( never a dainty hound ) ate that which he should have passed by .
only <name> , of the <unk> tan head and the sad , discerning eyes , made any attempt to uphold the honour of england before the watching village .
" you ca n't expect everything , " said the governor after breakfast .
" we got it , though  everything except foxes .
have you seen may queen's nose ? "
said the inspector .
" and mystery 's dead .
we 'll keep 'em coupled next time till we get well in among the crops .
i say , what a babbling <unk> that <unk> is !
ought to be drowned ! "
" they bury people so damn casual hereabouts .
give him another chance , " the inspector pleaded , not knowing that he should live to repent most bitterly .
" talkin ' of chances , " said the governor , " this sheikh lies about his barley bein ' a failure .
if it 's high enough to hide a hound at this time of year , it 's all right .
and he wants a fifty per cent <unk> , you said ? "
" you did n't go on past the melon patch where i tried to turn wanderer .
it 's all burned up from there on to the desert .
his other <unk> has broken down , too , " the inspector replied .
" very good .
we 'll split the difference and allow him twenty-five per cent off .
where 'll we meet to-morrow ? "
" there 's some trouble among the villages down the river about their <unk> .
it 's good goin ' ground there , too , " the inspector said .
the next meet , then , was some twenty miles down the river , and the pack were not enlarged till they were fairly among the fields .
abu hussein was there in force  four of him .
four delirious hunts of four minutes each  four hounds per fox  ended in four <unk> just above the river .
all the village looked on .
" we forgot about the <unk> .
the banks are riddled with 'em .
<unk> defeat us , " said the inspector .
" wait a moment ! "
the governor <name> forth a sneezing hound .
" i 've just remembered i 'm governor of these parts . "
" then turn out a black battalion to stop for us .
we 'll need 'em , old man . "
the governor straightened his back .
" give ear , o people ! "
he cried .
" i make a new law ! "
the villagers closed in .
he called :  " henceforward i <name> give one dollar to the man on whose land abu hussein is found .
and another dollar "  he held up the coin  " to the man on whose land these dogs shall kill him .
but to the man on whose land abu hussein shall run into a hole such as is this hole , i <name> give not dollars , but a most <unk> beating .
is it understood ? "
" our excellency , " a man stepped forth , " on my land abu hussein was found this morning .
is it not so , brothers ? "
none denied .
the governor tossed him over four dollars without a word .
" on my land they all went into their holes , " cried another .
" therefore i must be beaten . "
" not so .
the land is mine , and mine are the beatings . "
this second speaker thrust forward his shoulders already bared , and the villagers shouted .
" hullo !
two men anxious to be licked ?
there must be some swindle about the land , " said the governor .
then in the local vernacular : " what are your rights to the beating ? "
as a <unk> changes beneath a slant of the sun , that which had been a scattered mob changed to a court of most ancient justice .
the hounds tore and sobbed at abu hussein 's <unk> , all unnoticed among the legs of the witnesses , and gihon , also accustomed to laws , purred approval .
" you <name> not wait till the judges come up the river to settle the dispute ? "
said the governor at last .
" no ! "
shouted all the village save the man who had first asked to be beaten .
" we <name> abide by our excellency 's decision .
let our excellency turn out the creatures of the <unk> who stole our land in the days of the oppression . "
" and thou sayest ? "
the governor turned to the man who had first asked to be beaten .
" i say 1 <name> wait till the wise judges come down in the steamer .
then i <name> bring my many witnesses , " he replied .
" he is <name> .
he <name> bring many witnesses , " the village sheikh muttered .
" no need .
thy own mouth <unk> thee ! "
the governor cried .
" no man lawfully entitled to his land would wait one hour before entering upon it .
stand aside ! "
the man , fell back , and the village jeered him .
the second claimant stooped quickly beneath the lifted <unk> .
the village rejoiced .
" oh , such an one ; son of such an one , " said the governor , prompted by the sheikh , " learn , from the day when i send the order , to block up all the holes where abu hussein may hide on  thy  land ! "
the light <unk> ended .
the man stood up triumphant .
by that <unk> had the supreme government acknowledged his title before all men .
while the village praised the <unk> of the governor , a naked , <unk> child strode forward to the earth , and stood on one leg , unconcerned as a young stork .
" <name> " he said , hands behind his back .
" this should be blocked up with bundles of <unk> stalks  or , better , bundles of thorns . "
" better thorns , " said the governor .
" thick ends innermost . "
the child nodded gravely and squatted on the sand .
" an evil day for thee , abu hussein , " he shrilled into the mouth of the earth .
" a day of obstacles to thy <unk> returns in the morning . "
" who is it ? "
the governor asked the sheikh .
" it thinks . "
" farag the <unk> .
his people were slain in the days of the oppression .
the man to whom our excellency has awarded the land is , as it were , his maternal uncle . "
" <name> it come with me and feed the big dogs ? "
said the governor .
the other peering children <name> back .
" run ! "
they cried .
" our excellency <name> feed farag to the big dogs . "
" i <name> come , " said farag .
" and i <name> never go . "
he threw his arm round <name> 's neck , and the wise beast licked his face .
" <unk> , by jove ! "
the inspector cried .
" no ! "
said the governor .
" i believe he has the <unk> of a <name> <unk> ! "
farag waved his hand to his uncle , and led <name> on to the barge .
the rest of the pack followed .
* * * * * gihon , that had seen many sports , learned to know the hunt barge well .
he met her rounding his bends on grey december <unk> to music wild and lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of dervish drums , when , high above <name> 's tenor <name> , sharper even than lying <unk> 's <unk> break , farag chanted deathless war against abu hussein and all his seed .
at sunrise the river would shoulder her carefully into her place , and listen to the rush and <unk> of the pack fleeing up the gang-plank , and the tramp of the governor 's arab behind them .
they would pass over the brow into the <unk> crops where gihon , low and shrunken , could only guess what they were about when abu hussein flew down the bank to scratch at a stopped earth , and flew back into the barley again .
as farag had foretold , it was evil days for abu hussein ere he learned to take the necessary steps and to get away <unk> .
sometimes gihon saw the whole procession of the hunt <unk> against the <unk> , bearing him company for many <name> miles .
at every half mile the horses and the donkeys jumped the <unk>  up , on , change your leg , and off again like figures in a <unk> , till they grew small along the line of <unk> .
then <unk> waited their rustling return through the crops , and took them to rest on his bosom at ten o'clock .
while the horses ate , and farag slept with his head on <name> 's flank , the governor and his inspector worked for the good of the hunt and his province .
after a little time there was no need to beat any man for neglecting his <unk> .
the steamer 's destination was telegraphed from <unk> to <unk> , and the villagers stopped out and put to according .
if an earth were overlooked , it meant some dispute as to the ownership of the land , and then and there the hunt checked and settled it in this wise : the governor and the inspector side by side , but the latter half a horse 's length to the rear ; both <unk> claimants well in front ; the villagers <unk> behind them , and farag with the pack , who quite understood the performance , sitting down on the left .
twenty minutes were enough to settle the most complicated case , for , as the governor said to a judge on the steamer , " one gets at the truth in a <unk> a heap quicker than in your <unk> . "
" but when the evidence is conflicting ? "
the judge suggested .
" watch the field .
they 'll throw tongue fast enough if you 're running a wrong scent .
you 've never had an appeal from one of my decisions yet . "
the <unk> on horseback  the lesser folk on clever donkeys  the children so despised by farag soon understood that villages which repaired their <unk> and channels stood highest in the governor's favour .
he bought their barley , for his horses .
" channels , " he said , " are necessary that we may all jump them .
they are necessary , moreover , for the crops .
let there be many wheels and sound channels  and much good barley . "
" without money , " replied an aged sheikh , " there are no <unk> . "
" i <name> lend the money , " said the governor .
" at what interest , o our excellency ? "
" take you two of may <name> 's puppies to bring up in your village in such a manner that they do not eat filth , nor lose their hair , nor catch fever from lying in the sun , but become wise hounds . "
" like <unk>  not like <unk> ? "
( already it was an insult along the river to compare a man to the shifty <unk> <unk> <unk> . )
" certainly , like <unk>  not in the least like <unk> .
that shall be the interest on the <name> .
let the puppies thrive and the <unk> be built , and i shall be content , " said the governor .
" the wheel shall be built , but , o our excellency , if by god 's favour the <unk> grow to be <unk> , not <unk> , not unaccustomed to their names , not lawless , who <name> do them and me justice at the time of judging the young dogs ? "
" hounds , man , hounds !
<unk> , o sheikh , we call them in their manhood . "
" the <unk> when they are judged at the <unk> .
i have <unk> down the river to whom our excellency has also entrusted <unk> to bring up . "
" puppies , man !
<unk> we call them , o sheikh , in their childhood . "
" <unk> .
my enemies may judge my <unk> unjustly at the <unk> .
this must be thought of . "
" i see the obstacle .
hear now !
if the new <unk> is built in a month without oppression , thou , o sheikh , shalt be named one of the judges to judge the <unk> at the <unk> .
is it understood ? "
" understood .
we <name> build the wheel .
i and my seed are responsible for the <unk> of the <name> .
where are my <unk> ?
if they eat fowls , must they on any account eat the feathers ? "
" on no account must they eat the feathers .
farag in the barge <name> tell thee how they are to live . "
there is no instance of any default on the governor 's personal and <unk> loans , for which they called him the father of <unk> .
but the first <unk> at the capital needed enormous tact and the presence of a black battalion ostentatiously drilling in the barrack square to prevent trouble after the <unk> .
but who can chronicle the glories of the gihon hunt  or their shames ?
who remembers the kill in the market-place , when the governor bade the assembled <unk> and warriors observe how the hounds would instantly devour the body of abu hussein ; but how , when he had scientifically broken it up , the weary pack turned from it in loathing , and farag wept because he said the world 's face had been blackened ?
what men who have not yet ridden beyond the sound of any horn recall the midnight run which ended  <unk> leading  among tombs ; the hasty <unk> , and the oath , taken <unk> e bones , to forget the worry ?
the desert run , when abu hussein forsook the cultivation , and made a <unk> point to earth in a desolate <unk>  when strange armed riders on camels swooped out of a ravine , and instead of giving battle , offered to take the tired hounds home on their beasts .
which they did , and vanished .
above all , who remembers the death of <name> , when a certain sheikh wept above the body of the <unk> hound as it might have been his son 's  and that day the hunt rode no more ?
the <unk> <unk> says little of this , but at the end of their second season ( forty-nine brace ) appears the dark entry : " new blood badly wanted .
they are beginning to listen to <unk> . "
* * * * * the inspector attended to the matter when his leave fell due .
" remember , " said the governor , " you must get us the best blood in england  real , dainty hounds  expense no object , but do n't trust your own judgment .
present my letters of introduction , and take what they give you . "
the inspector presented his letters in a society where they make much of horses , more of hounds , and are tolerably civil to men who can ride .
they passed him from house to house , mounted him according to his merits , and fed him , after five years of goat chop and worcester sauce , perhaps a thought too richly .
the seat or castle where he made his great coup does not much matter .
four masters of <unk> were at table , and in a mellow hour the inspector told them stories of the gihon hunt .
he ended : " <name> said i was n't to trust my own judgment about hounds , but i think there ought to be a special tariff for <unk> . "
as soon as his hosts could speak , they reassured him on this point .
" and now tell us about your first <unk> all over again , " said one .
" and about the <unk> ' .
was that all <name> 's own invention ? "
said another .
" wait a moment , " said a large , clean-shaven man  not an <unk>  at the end of the table .
" are your villagers habitually beaten by your governor when they fail to stop foxes ' holes ? "
the tone and the phrase were enough even if , as the inspector confessed afterwards , the big , blue <unk> man had not looked so like <unk> .
he took him on for the honour of <unk> .
" we only hunt twice a week  sometimes three times .
i 've never known a man <unk> more than four times a week unless there 's a bye . "
the large <unk> man flung his napkin down , came round the table , cast himself into the chair next the inspector , and leaned forward earnestly , so that he breathed in the inspector 's face .
" <unk> with what ? "
he said .
" with the <unk>  on the feet .
a <unk> is a strip of old <unk> with a sort of keel on it , like the cutting edge of a boar 's tusk .
but we use the rounded side for a first offender . "
" and do any consequences follow this sort of thing ?
for the victim , i mean  not for you ? "
" <unk> rarely .
let me be fair .
i 've never seen a man die under the lash , but <unk> may set up if the <unk> has been pickled . "
" pickled in what ? "
all the table was still and interested .
" in <unk> , of course .
did n't you know that " said the inspector .
" thank god i did n't . "
the large man sputtered visibly .
the inspector wiped his face and grew bolder .
" you must n't think we 're careless about our <unk> .
we 've a hunt fund for hot tar .
tar 's a splendid dressing if the <unk> aren't beaten off .
but huntin ' as large a country as we do , we may n't be back at that village for a month , and if the <unk> ai n't renewed , and <unk> sets in , often as not you find your man pegging about on his stumps .
we 've a well-known local name for 'em down the river .
we call 'em the <unk> 's cranes .
you see , i persuaded the governor only to <unk> on one foot . "
" on one foot ?
the <unk> 's cranes ! "
the large man turned purple to the top of his bald head .
" would you mind giving me the local word for <unk> 's cranes ? "
from a too well-stocked memory the inspector <name> one short adhesive word which surprises by itself even <unk> <unk> .
he spelt it out , saw the large man write it down on his cuff and withdraw .
then the inspector translated a few of its <unk> and <unk> to the four masters of <unk> .
he left three days later with eight couple of the best hounds in england  a free and a friendly and an ample gift from four packs to the gihon hunt .
he had honestly meant to <unk> the large blue mottled man , but somehow forgot about it .
the new draft marks a new chapter in the hunt 's history .
from an isolated phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent institution with <unk> <unk> ashore , and an influence social , political , and administrative , <unk> with the boundaries of the province .
<name> , the governor , departed to england , where he kept a pack of real dainty hounds , but never ceased to long for the old lawless lot .
his successors were <unk> masters of the gihon hunt , as all <unk> were whips .
for one reason ; farag , the kennel huntsman , in khaki and <unk> , would obey nothing under the rank of an excellency , and the hounds would obey no one but farag ; for another , the best way of estimating crop returns and revenue was by riding straight to hounds ; for a third , though judges down the river issued signed and sealed <unk> to all lawful owners , yet public opinion along the river never held any such title valid till it had been confirmed , according to precedent , by the governor 's hunting crop in the hunting field , above the wilfully neglected earth .
true , the ceremony had been cut down to three mere taps on the shoulder , but governors who tried to evade that much found themselves and their office compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses who took up their time with <unk> and , worse still , neglected the puppies .
the older <unk> , indeed , stood out for the <unk> beatings of the old days  the sharper the punishment , they argued , the surer the title ; but here the hand of modern progress was against them , and they contented themselves with telling tales of <name> the first governor , whom they called the father of <unk> , and of that heroic age when men , horses , and hounds were worth following .
this same modern progress which brought dog biscuit and brass <unk> to the <unk> was at work all over the world .
forces , activities , and movements sprang into being , agitated themselves , <unk> , and , in one political avalanche , overwhelmed a bewildered , and not in the least intending it , england .
the echoes of the new <name> were borne into the province on the wings of inexplicable cables .
the gihon hunt read speeches and sentiments , and policies which amazed them , and they thanked god , prematurely , that their province was too far off , too hot , and too hard worked to be reached by those speakers or their policies .
but they , with others , <unk> the scope and purpose of the new <name> .
one by one , the provinces of the empire were hauled up and baited , hit and held , lashed under the belly , and forced back on their haunches for the amusement of their new masters in the parish of westminster .
one by one they fell away , sore and angry , to compare stripes with each other at the ends of the uneasy earth .
even so the gihon hunt , like abu hussein in the old days , did not understand .
then it reached them through the press that they habitually flogged to death good <unk> cultivators who neglected to stop <unk> ; but that the few , the very few who did not die under <unk> whips soaked in <unk> , walked about on their <unk> <unk> , and were known in derision as the <unk> 's cranes .
the charges were <unk> for in the house of commons by a mr. <unk> groombride , who had formed a committee , and was <unk> literature : the province groaned ; the inspector  now an inspector of <unk>  whistled .
he had forgotten the gentleman who sputtered in people 's faces .
" he should n't have looked so like <unk> ! "
was his sole defence when he met the governor at breakfast on the steamer after a meet .
" you should n't have joked with an animal of that class , " said <name> the governor .
" look what farag has brought me ! "
it was a pamphlet , signed on behalf of a committee by a <name> secretary , but composed by some person who thoroughly understood the language of the province .
after telling the tale of the beatings , it recommended all the beaten to institute criminal proceedings against their governor , and , as soon as might be , to rise against english oppression and tyranny .
such documents were new in <unk> in those days .
the inspector read the last half <name> .
" but  but , " he stammered , " this is impossible .
white men do n't write this sort of stuff . "
" do n't they , just ? "
said the governor .
" they get made cabinet ministers for doing it too .
i went home last year .
i know . "
" it 'll blow over , " said the inspector weakly .
" not it .
groombride is coming down here to investigate the matter in a few days . "
" for himself ? "
" the imperial government 's behind him .
perhaps you 'd like to look t my orders . "
the governor laid down an <unk> cable .
the <unk> to it ran : " you <name> afford mr. groombride every facility for his inquiry , and <name> be held responsible that no obstacles are put in his way to the fullest possible examination of any witnesses which he may consider necessary .
he <name> be accompanied by his own interpreter , who must not be tampered with . "
" that 's to me  governor of the province ! "
said <name> the governor .
" it seems about enough , " the inspector answered .
farag , <unk> , entered the saloon , as was his privilege .
" my uncle , who was beaten by the father of <unk> , would approach , o excellency , " he said , " and there are others on the bank . "
" admit , " said the governor .
there tramped aboard <unk> and villagers to the number of seventeen .
in each man 's hand was a copy of the pamphlet ; in each man 's eye terror and uneasiness of the sort that governors spend and are spent to clear away .
farag 's uncle , now sheikh of the village , spoke : " it is written in this book , excellency , that the beatings whereby we hold our lands are all valueless .
it is written that every man who received such a beating from the father of <unk> who slow the <unk> , should instantly begin a lawsuit , because the title to his land is not valid . "
" it is so written .
we do not wish <unk> .
we wish to hold the land as it was given to us after the days of the oppression , " they cried .
the governor glanced at the inspector .
this was serious .
to cast doubt on the ownership of land means , in <unk> , the letting in of waters , and the getting out of troops .
" your titles are good , " said the governor .
the inspector confirmed with a nod .
" then what is the meaning of these writings which came from down the river where the judges are ? "
farag 's uncle waved his copy .
" by whose order are we ordered to slay you , o excellency our governor ? "
" it is not written that you are to slay me . "
" not in those very words , but if we leave an earth <unk> , it is the same as though we wished to save abu hussein from the hounds .
these writings say : <unk> your rulers . '
how can we abolish except we kill ?
we hear rumours of one who comes from down the river soon to lead us to kill . "
" fools ! "
said the governor .
" your titles are good .
this is madness ! "
" it is so written , " they answered like a pack .
" listen , " said the inspector smoothly .
" i know who caused the writings to be written and sent .
he is a man of a <unk> jowl , in aspect like <unk> who ate unclean matters .
he <name> come up the river and <name> give tongue about the beatings . "
" <name> he <unk> our <unk> ?
an evil day for him ! "
" go slow , baker , " the governor whispered .
" they 'll kill him if they get scared about their land . "
" i tell a parable . "
the inspector lit a cigarette .
" declare which of you took to walk the children of <unk> ? "
" <unk> first or second ? "
said farag quickly .
" the second  the one which was lamed by the thorn . "
" no  no .
<unk> the second strained her shoulder leaping my <unk> , " a sheikh cried .
" <unk> the first was lamed by the thorns on the day when our excellency fell thrice . "
" true  true .
the second <unk> 's mate was <unk> , the pied hound , " said the inspector .
" i had two of the second <unk> 's <unk> , " said farag 's uncle .
" they died of the madness in their ninth month . "
" and how did they do before they died ? "
said the inspector .
" they ran about in the sun , and <unk> at the mouth till they died . "
" wherefore ? "
" god knows .
he sent the madness .
it was no fault of mine . "
" thy own mouth hath answered thee . "
the inspector laughed .
" it is with men as it is with dogs .
god <unk> some with a madness .
it is no fault of ours if such men run about in the sun and froth at the mouth .
the man who is coming <name> emit spray from his mouth in speaking , and <name> always edge and push in towards his hearers .
when ye see and hear him ye <name> understand that he is afflicted of god : being mad .
he is in god's hands . "
" but our titles  are our titles to our lands good ? "
the crowd repeated .
" your titles are in my hands  they are good , " said the governor .
" and he who wrote the writings is an afflicted of god ? "
said <unk> uncle .
" the inspector hath said it , " cried the governor .
" ye <name> see when the man comes .
o <unk> and men , have we ridden together and walked puppies together , and bought and sold barley for the horses that after these years we should run riot on the scent of a madman  an afflicted of god ? "
" but the hunt pays us to kill mad jackals , " said farag 's uncle .
" and he who questions my titles to my land  " " <unk> !
<unk> riot ! "
the governor 's <unk> cracked like a <unk> .
" by allah , " he thundered , " if the afflicted of god come to any harm at your hands , i myself <name> shoot every hound and every puppy , and the hunt shall ride no more .
on your heads be it .
go in peace , and tell the others . "
" the hunt shall ride no more , " said farag 's uncle .
" then how can the land be governed ?
no  no , o excellency our governor , we <name> not harm a hair on the head of the afflicted of god .
he shall be to us as is abu hussein 's wife in the breeding season . "
when they were gone the governor mopped his forehead .
" we must put a few soldiers in every village this groombride visits , baker .
tell 'em to keep out of sight , and have an eye on the villagers .
he 's trying 'em rather high . "
" o excellency , " said the smooth voice of farag , laying the field and country life square on the table , " is the afflicted of god who resembles <unk> one with the man whom the inspector met in the great house in england , and to whom he told the tale of the <unk> 's cranes ? "
" the same man , farag , " said the inspector .
" i have often heard the inspector tell the tale to our excellency at <unk> in the <unk> ; but since i am in the government service i have never told it to my people .
may i loose that tale among the villages ? "
* * * * * the governor nodded .
" no harm , " said he .
the details of mr. groombride 's arrival , with his interpreter , whom he proposed should eat with him at the governor 's table , his <unk> to the governor on the new movement , and the sins of <unk> , i purposely omit .
at three in the afternoon mr. groombride said : " i <name> go out now and address your victims in this village . "
" wo n't you find it rather hot ? "
said the governor .
" they generally take 'a nap till sunset at this time of year . "
mr. groombride 's large , loose lips set .
" that , " he replied pointedly , " would be enough to decide me .
i fear you have not quite mastered your instructions .
may i ask you to send for my interpreter ?
i <name> he has not been tampered with by your subordinates . "
he was a yellowish boy called <name> , who had well eaten and drunk with farag .
the inspector , by the way , was not present at the meal .
" at whatever risk , i shall go unattended , " said mr. groombride .
" your presence would cow them  from giving evidence .
<name> , my good friend , would you very kindly open the umbrella ? "
he passed up the gang-plank to the village , and with no more prelude than a salvation army picket in a portsmouth <unk> , cried : " oh , my brothers ! "
he did not guess how his path had been prepared .
the village was widely awake .
farag , in loose , flowing garments , quite unlike a kennel huntsman 's khaki and <unk> , leaned against the wall of his uncle's house .
" come and see the afflicted of god , " he cried musically , " whose face , indeed , resembles that of <unk> . "
the village came , and decided that on the whole farag was right .
" i ca n't quite catch what they are saying , " said mr. groombride .
" they saying they very much pleased to see you , sar , " <unk> interpreted .
" then i do think they might have sent a deputation to the steamer ; but i suppose they were frightened of the officials .
tell them not to be frightened , <name> . "
" he says you are not to be frightened , " <name> explained .
a child here sputtered with laughter .
" refrain from mirth , " farag cried .
" the afflicted of god is the guest of the excellency our governor .
we are responsible for every hair of his head . "
" he has none , " a voice spoke .
" he has the white and the shining <unk> . "
" now tell them what i have come for , <name> , and please keep the umbrella well up .
i think i shall reserve myself for my little vernacular speech at the end . "
" approach !
look !
listen ! "
<name> chanted .
" the afflicted of god <name> now make sport .
presently he <name> speak in your tongue , and <name> consume you with mirth .
i have been his servant for three weeks .
i <name> tell you about his <unk> and his perfumes for his head . "
he told them at length .
" and didst thou take any of his perfume bottles ? "
said farag at the end .
" i am his servant .
i took two , " <name> replied .
" ask him , " said farag 's uncle , " what he knows about our <unk> .
ye young men are all alike . "
he waved a pamphlet .
mr. groombride smiled to see how the seed sown in london had borne fruit by gihon .
lo !
all the seniors held copies of the pamphlet .
" he knows less than a buffalo .
he told me on the steamer that he was driven out of his own land by <unk> which is a devil inhabiting crowds and assemblies , " said <name> .
" allah between us and evil ! "
a woman <unk> from the darkness of a hut .
" come in , children , he may have the evil eye . "
" no , my aunt , " said farag .
" no afflicted of god has an evil eye .
wait till ye hear his <unk> speech which he <name> deliver .
i have heard it twice from <name> . "
" they seem very quick to grasp the point .
how far have you got , <name> ? "
" all about the beatings , sar .
they are highly interested . "
" do n't forget about the local self-government , and please hold the umbrella over me .
it is hopeless to destroy unless one first builds up . "
" he may not have the evil eye , " farag 's uncle grunted , " but his devil led him too certainly to question my <unk> .
ask him whether he still doubts my <unk> ? "
" or mine , or mine ? "
cried the elders .
" what odds ?
he is an afflicted of god , " farag called .
" remember the tale i told you . "
" yes , but he is an englishman , and doubtless of influence , or our excellency would not entertain him .
bid the down-country jackass ask him . "
" sar , " said <name> , " these people , much fearing they may be turned out of their land in consequence of your remarks .
therefore they ask you to make promise no bad consequences following your visit . "
mr. groombride held his breath and turned purple .
then he stamped his foot .
" tell them , " he cried , " that if a hair of any one of their heads is touched by any official on any account whatever , all england shall ring with it .
good god !
what <unk> oppression !
the dark places of the earth are full of cruelty . "
he wiped his face , and throwing out his arms cried : " tell them , oh !
tell the poor , serfs not to be afraid of me .
tell them i come to redress their wrongs  not , heaven knows , to add to their burden . "
the long-drawn <unk> of the practised public speaker pleased them much .
" that is how the new <unk> runs out in the kennel , " said farag .
" the excellency our governor entertains him that he may make sport .
make him say the <unk> speech . "
" what did he say about my <unk> ? "
farag 's uncle was not to be turned .
" he says , " farag interpreted , " that he desires , nothing better than that you should live on your lands in peace .
he talks as though he believed himself to be governor . "
" well .
we here are all witnesses to what he has said .
now go forward with the sport . "
farag 's uncle smoothed his garments .
" how <unk> hath allah made his creatures !
on one he <unk> strength to slay <unk> ; another he causes to go mad and wander in the sun , like the afflicted sons of <unk> . "
" yes , and to emit spray from the mouth , as the inspector told us .
all <name> happen as the inspector foretold , " said farag .
" i have never yet seen the inspector thrown out during any run . "
" i think , " <name> plucked at mr. groombride 's sleeves , " i think perhaps it is better now , sar , if you give your fine little native speech .
they not understanding english , but much pleased at your <unk> . "
" <unk> ? "
mr. groombride spun round .
" if they only knew how i felt towards them in my heart !
if i could express a <unk> of my feelings !
i must stay here and learn the language .
hold up the umbrella , <unk> i think my little speech <name> show them i know something of their vie <unk> . "
it was a short , simple ; carefully learned address , and the accent , <unk> by <name> on the steamer , allowed the hearers to guess its meaning , which was a request to see one of the <unk> 's cranes ; since the <name> of the speaker 's life , the object to which he would <unk> his days , was to improve the condition of the <unk> 's cranes .
but first he must behold them with his own eyes .
would , then , his brethren , whom he loved , show him a <unk> 's crane whom he desired to love ?
once , twice , and again in his <unk> he repeated his demand , using always  that they might see he was acquainted with their local argot  using always , i say , the word which the inspector had given him in england long ago  the short , adhesive word which , by itself , surprises even <unk> <unk> .
there are limits to the sublime politeness of an ancient people .
a bulky , <unk> man in white clothes , his name <unk> across his lower <unk> , spluttering from under a <unk> umbrella almost tearful appeals to be introduced to the <unk> ; naming loudly the <unk> ; dancing , as it seemed , in perverse <name> at mere mention of the <unk>  found those limits .
there was a moment's hush , and then such mirth as gihon through his centuries had never heard  a roar like to the roar of his own cataracts in flood .
children cast themselves on the ground , and rolled back and forth cheering and whooping ; strong men , their faces hidden in their clothes , swayed in silence , till the agony became insupportable , and they threw up their heads and <unk> at the sun ; women , mothers and virgins , shrilled shriek upon mounting shriek , and slapped their thighs as it might have been the roll of musketry .
when they tried to draw breath , some <unk> voice would quack out the word , and the riot began afresh .
last to fall was the <unk> <name> .
he held on to the edge of apoplexy , then collapsed , throwing the umbrella from him .
mr. groombride should not be judged too harshly .
exercise and strong emotion under a hot sun , the shock of public ingratitude , for the moment <unk> his spirit .
he furled the umbrella , and with t beat the prostrate <name> , crying that he had been betrayed .
in which posture the inspector , on horseback , followed by the governor , suddenly found him .
* * * * * " that 's all very well , " said the inspector , when he had taken <unk> dramatically dying <unk> on the steamer , " but you ca n't hammer a native merely because he laughs at you .
i see nothing for it but the law to take its course . "
" you might reduce the charge to  er  <unk> with an interpreter , " said the governor .
mr. groombride was too far gone to be comforted .
" it 's the publicity that i fear , " he wailed .
" is there no possible means of <unk> up the affair ?
you do n't know what a question  a single question in the house means to a man of my position  the ruin of my political career , i assure you . "
" i should n't have imagined it , " said the governor thoughtfully .
" and , though perhaps i ought not to say it , i am not without honour in my own country  or influence .
a word in season , as you know , your excellency .
it might <name> an official far . "
the governor shuddered .
" yes , that had to come too , " he said to himself .
" well , look here .
if i tell this man of yours to withdraw the charge against you , you can go to gehenna for aught i care .
the only condition i make is that if you write  i suppose that 's part of your business about your travels , you do n't praise me ! "
so far mr. groombride has loyally adhered to this understanding .
gallio 's song all day long to the <unk> the crazed <unk> <name>  all day long at their ruler 's feet howled for the blood of the jew .
insurrection with one accord banded itself and woke : and <name> was about to open his mouth when <unk> 's deputy spoke " whether the god descend from above or the man ascend upon high , whether this maker of tents be jove or a younger deity  i <name> be no judge between your gods and your godless <unk> , <unk> , drive them hence with rods  i care for none of these things !
" were it a question of lawful due or a <unk> 's hire denied , reason would i should bear with you and order it well to be tried but this is a question of words and names and i know the strife it brings , i <name> not pass upon any your claims .
i care for none of these things .
" one thing only i see most clear , as i pray you also see .
claudius caesar hath set me here rome 's deputy to be .
it is her peace that ye go to break not mine , nor any king 's , but , touching your clamour of <unk> sake , ' i care for none of these things ! "
the house surgeon on an evening after <name> day , i sat at a table in a homeward bound steamer 's smoking-room , where half a dozen of us told ghost stories .
as our party broke up a man , playing <name> in the next alcove , said to me : " i did n't quite catch the end of that last story about the curse on the family 's first-born . "
" it turned out to be drains , " i explained .
" as soon as new ones were put into the house the curse was lifted , i believe .
i never knew the people myself . "
" ah !
i 've had my drains up twice ; i 'm on gravel too . "
" you do n't mean to say you 've a ghost in your house ?
why did n't you join our party ? "
" any more orders , gentlemen , before the bar closes ? "
the steward interrupted .
" sit down again , and have one with me , " said the <name> player .
" no , it is n't a ghost .
our trouble is more depression than anything else . "
" how interesting ?
then it 's nothing any one can see ? "
" it 's  it 's nothing worse than a little depression .
and the odd part is that there has n't been a death in the house since it was built  in 1863 .
the lawyer said so .
that decided me  my good <name> , rather and he made me pay an extra thousand for it . "
" how curious .
unusual , too ! "
i said .
" yes ; ai n't it ?
it was built for three sisters  moultrie was the name  three old maids .
they all lived together ; the eldest owned it .
i bought it from her lawyer a few years ago , and if i 've spent a pound on the place first and last , i must have spent five thousand .
electric light , new servants ' wing , garden  all that sort of thing .
a man and his family ought to be happy after so much expense , ai n't it ? "
he looked at me through the bottom of his glass .
" does it affect your family much ? "
" my good <name>  she 's a greek , by the way  and myself are middle-aged .
we can bear up against depression ; but it 's hard on my little girl .
i say little ; but she 's twenty .
we send her visiting to escape it .
she almost lived at hotels and <unk> , last year , but that is n't pleasant for her .
she used to be a canary  a perfect canary  always singing .
you ought to hear her .
she does n't sing now .
that sort of thing 's unwholesome for the young , ai n't it ? "
" ca n't you get rid of the place ? "
i suggested .
" not except at a sacrifice , and we are fond of it .
just suits us three .
we 'd love it if we were allowed . "
" what do you mean by not being allowed ? "
" i mean because of the depression .
it spoils everything . "
" what 's it like exactly ? "
" i could n't very well explain .
it must be seen to be appreciated , as the auctioneers say .
now , i was much impressed by the story you were telling just now . "
" it was n't true , " i said .
" my tale is true .
if you would do me the pleasure to come down and spend a night at my little place , you 'd learn more than you would if i talked till morning .
very likely 'twould n't touch your good self at all .
you might be  <unk> , ai n't it ?
on the other hand , if this <unk> ,  influence does happen to affect you , why , i think it <name> be an experience . "
while he talked he gave me his card , and i read his name was l. <name> m'leod , esq. , of holmescroft .
a city address was tucked away in a corner .
" my business , " he added , " used to be furs .
if you are interested in furs  i 've given thirty years of my life to 'em . "
" you 're very kind , " i murmured .
" far from it , i assure you .
i can meet you next saturday afternoon anywhere in london you choose to name , and i 'll be only too happy to motor you down .
it ought to be a delightful run at this time of year the rhododendrons <name> be out .
i mean it .
you do n't know how truly i mean it .
very probably  it wo n't affect you at all .
and  i think i may say i have the finest collection of <unk> tusks in the world .
all the best skins and horns have to go through london , and l. <name> m'leod , he knows where they come from , and where they go to .
that 's his business . "
for the rest of the voyage <unk> mr. m'leod talked to me of the assembling , preparation , and sale of the rarer furs ; and told me things about the manufacture of <unk> coats which quite shocked me .
somehow or other , when we landed on wednesday , i found myself pledged to spend that week-end with him at holmescroft .
on saturday he met me with a <unk> motor , and ran me out , in an hour and a half , to an exclusive <unk> district of <unk> roads and elegantly designed country villas , each standing in from three to five acres of perfectly appointed land .
he told me land was selling at eight hundred pounds the acre , and the new golf links , whose <name> <name> pavilion we passed , had cost nearly twenty-four thousand pounds to create .
holmescroft was a large , two-storied , low , <unk> residence .
a verandah at the south side gave on to a garden and two tennis courts , separated by a <unk> iron fence from a most <unk> meadow of five or six acres , where two jersey cows grazed .
tea was ready in the shade of a promising copper beech , and i could see groups on the lawn of young men and maidens appropriately clothed , playing lawn tennis in the <name> .
" a pretty scene , ai n't it ? "
said mr. m'leod .
" my good <name> 's sitting under the tree , and that 's my little girl in pink on the far court .
but i 'll take you to your room , and you can see 'em all later . "
he led me through a wide <unk> hall furnished in pale lemon , with huge <unk> vases , an <unk> and gold grand piano , and banks of pot flowers in benares brass bowls , up a pale oak staircase to a spacious landing , where there was a green <name> settee trimmed with silver .
the blinds were down , and the light lay in parallel lines on the floors .
he showed me my room , saying cheerfully : " you may be a little tired .
one often is without knowing it after a run through traffic .
do n't come down till you feel quite restored .
we shall all be in the garden . "
my room was rather warm , and smelt of perfumed soap .
i threw up the window at once , but it opened so close to the floor and worked so clumsily that i came within an ace of pitching out , where i should certainly have ruined a rather <unk> laburnum below .
as i set about washing off the journey 's dust , i began to feel a little tired .
but , i reflected , i had not come down here in this weather and among these new surroundings to be depressed ; so i began to whistle .
and it was just then that i was aware of a little grey shadow , as it might have been a <unk> seen against the light , floating at an immense distance in the background of my <name> .
it annoyed me , and i shook my head to get rid of it .
then my <name> telegraphed that it was the forerunner of a <unk> gloom which there was yet time to escape if i would force my thoughts away from it , as a man leaping for life forces his body forward and away from the fall of a wall .
but the gloom overtook me before i could take in the meaning of the message .
i moved toward the bed , every nerve already aching with the <unk> of the pain that was to be dealt it , and sat down , while my amazed and angry soul dropped , gulf by gulf , into that horror of great darkness which is spoken of in the bible , and which , as auctioneers say , must be experienced to be appreciated .
despair upon despair , misery upon misery , fear after fear , each causing their distinct and separate woe , packed in upon me for an <unk> length of time , until at last they blurred together , and i heard a click in my <name> like the click in the ear when one descends in a diving <name> , and i knew that the pressures were <unk> within and without , and that , for the moment , the worst was at an end .
but i knew also that at any moment the darkness might come down anew ; and while , i dwelt on this speculation precisely as a man torments a raging tooth with his tongue , it ebbed away into the little grey shadow on the <name> of its first coming , and once more i heard my <name> , which knew what would recur , telegraph to every quarter fox help , release or diversion .
the door opened , and m'leod reappeared .
i thanked him politely , saying i was charmed with my room , anxious to meet mrs. m'leod , much refreshed with my wash , and so on and so forth .
beyond a little <unk> at the corners of my mouth , it seemed to me that i was managing my words admirably ; the while that i myself cowered at the bottom of <unk> pits .
m'leod laid his hand on my shoulder , and said " you 've got it now already , ai n't it ? "
" yes , " i answered .
" it 's making me sick ! "
" it <name> pass off when you come outside .
i give you my word it <name> then pass off .
come ! "
i <unk> out behind him , and wiped my forehead in the hall .
" you mus n't mind , " he said .
" i expect the run tired you .
my good <name> is sitting there under the copper beech . "
she was a fat woman in an <unk> gown , with a heavily powdered face , against which her black <unk> eyes showed like <unk> in dough .
i was introduced to many fine ladies and gentlemen of those parts .
magnificently appointed <unk> and covered motors swept in and out of the drive , and the air was <name> with the <name> outcries of the tennis players .
as twilight <name> on they all went away , and i was left alone with mr. and mrs. m'leod , while tall <unk> and <unk> took away the tennis and tea things .
miss m'leod had walked a little down the drive with a <unk> young man , who apparently knew everything about every south american railway stock .
he had told me at tea that these were the days of financial <unk> .
" i think it went off beautifully , my dear , " said mr. m'leod to his wife ; and to me : " you feel all right now , ai n't it ?
of course you do . "
mrs. m'leod surged across the gravel .
her husband skipped nimbly before her into the south verandah , turned a switch , and all holmescroft was flooded with light .
" you can do that from your room also , " he said as they went in .
" there is something in money , ai n't it ? "
miss m'leod came up behind me in the dusk .
" we have not yet been introduced , " she said , " but i suppose you are staying the night ? "
" your father was kind enough to ask me , " i replied .
she nodded .
" yes , i know ; and you know too , do n't you ?
i saw your face when you came to shake hands with mamma .
you felt the depression very soon .
it is simply frightful in that bedroom sometimes .
what do you think it is  <unk> ?
in greece , where i was a little girl , it might have been ; but not in england , do you think ?
or do you ? "
" cheer up , <name> .
it <name> all come right , " he insisted .
" no , papa . "
she shook her dark head .
" nothing is right while it comes . "
" it is nothing that we ourselves have ever done in our lives that i <name> swear to you , " said mrs. m'leod suddenly .
" and we have changed our servants several times .
so we know it is not them . "
" never mind .
let us enjoy ourselves while we can , " said mr. m'leod , opening the champagne .
but we did not enjoy ourselves .
the talk failed .
there were long silences .
" i beg your pardon , " i said , for i thought some one at my elbow was about to speak .
" ah !
that is the other thing ! "
said miss m'leod .
her mother groaned .
we were silent again , and , in a few seconds it must have been , a live grief beyond words  not ghostly dread or horror , but aching , helpless grief  overwhelmed us , each , i felt , according to his or her nature , and held steady like the beam of a burning glass .
behind that pain i was conscious there was a <name> on somebody 's part to explain something on which some tremendously important issue <name> .
meantime i rolled bread pills and remembered my sins ; m'leod considered his own reflection in a spoon ; his wife seemed to be praying , and the girl <unk> desperately with hands and feet , till the darkness passed on  as though the malignant rays of a <unk> had been shifted from us .
" there , " said miss m'leod , half rising .
" now you see what makes a happy home .
oh , sell it  sell it , father mine , and let us go away ! "
" but i 've spent thousands on it .
you shall go to <unk> next week , <name> dear . "
" i 'm only just back from hotels .
i am so tired of packing . "
" cheer up , <name> .
it is over .
you know it does not often come here twice in the same night .
i think we shall dare now to be comfortable . "
he lifted a <unk> , and helped his wife and daughter .
his face was lined and fallen like an old man 's after <unk> , but his hand did not shake , and his voice was clear .
as he worked to restore us by speech and action , he reminded me of a <unk> collie herding <unk> sheep .
after dinner we sat round the dining-room fire the drawing-room might have been under the shadow for aught we knew talking with the intimacy of gipsies by the wayside , or of wounded comparing notes after a skirmish .
by eleven o'clock the three between them had given me every name and detail they could recall that in any way bore on the house , and what they knew of its history .
we went to bed in a <unk> blaze of electric light .
my one fear was that the blasting gust of depression would return  the surest way , of course , to bring it .
i lay awake till <name> , breathing quickly and sweating lightly , beneath what de <unk> <unk> describes as " the oppression of <unk> guilt . "
now as soon as the lovely day was broken , i fell into the most terrible of all dreams  that joyous one in which all past evil has not only been wiped out of our lives , but has never been committed ; and in the very bliss of our assured innocence , before our loves shriek and change countenance , we wake to the day we have earned .
it was a <unk> morning , but we preferred to breakfast in the south verandah .
the forenoon we spent in the garden , pretending to play games that come out of boxes , such as croquet and clock golf .
but most of the time we <name> together and talked .
the young man who knew all about south american railways took miss m'leod for a walk in the afternoon , and at five m'leod thoughtfully whirled us all up to dine in town .
" now , do n't say you <name> tell the psychological society , and that you <name> come again , " said miss m'leod , as we parted .
" because i know you <name> not . "
" you should not say that , " said her mother .
" you should say , <unk> , mr. <unk> .
come again . ' "
" not him ! "
the girl cried .
" he has seen the <unk> 's head ! "
looking at myself in the restaurant 's mirrors , it seemed to me that i had not much benefited by my week-end .
next morning i wrote out all my holmescroft notes at fullest length , in the <name> that by so doing i could put it all behind me .
but the experience worked on my mind , as they say certain imperfectly understood rays work on the body .
i am less calculated to make a sherlock holmes than any man i know , for i lack both method and <name> , yet the idea of following up the trouble to its source fascinated me .
i had no theory to go on , except a vague idea that i had come between two poles of a discharge , and had taken a shock meant for some one else .
this was followed by a feeling of intense irritation .
i waited cautiously on myself , expecting to be overtaken by horror of the supernatural , but my self persisted in being humanly indignant , exactly as though it had been the victim of a practical joke .
it was in great pains and <unk>  that i felt in every fibre but its dominant idea , to put it coarsely , was to get back a bit of its own .
by this i knew that i might go forward if i could find the way .
after a few days it occurred to me to go to the office of mr. <unk> .
baxter  the solicitor who had sold holmescroft to m'leod .
i explained i had some notion of buying the place .
would he act for me in the matter ?
mr. baxter , a large , <unk> , <unk> man , showed no enthusiasm .
" i sold it to mr. m'leod , " he said .
" it 'ud scarcely do for me to start on the <unk> tack now .
but i can recommend  " " i know he 's asking an awful price , " i interrupted , " and atop of it he wants an extra thousand for what he calls your clean <name> of health . "
mr. baxter sat up in his chair .
i had all his attention .
" your guarantee with the house .
do n't you remember it ? "
" yes , yes .
that no death had taken place in the house since it was built : i remember perfectly . "
he did not gulp as untrained men do when they lie , but his jaws moved <unk> , and his eyes , turning towards the deed boxes on the wall , dulled .
i counted seconds , one , two , three  one , two , three up to ten .
a man , i knew , can live through ages of mental depression in that time .
" i remember perfectly . "
his mouth opened a little as though it had tasted old bitterness .
" of course that sort of thing does n't appeal to me . "
i went on .
" i don't expect to buy a house free from death . "
" certainly not .
no one does .
but it was mr. m'leod 's fancy  his <unk> rather , i believe ; and since we could meet it  it was my duty to my clients at whatever cost to my own feelings  to make him pay . "
" that 's really why i came to you .
i understood from him you knew the place well . "
" oh , yes .
always did .
it originally belonged to some connections of mine . "
" the misses moultrie , i suppose .
how interesting !
they must have loved the place before the country round about was built up . "
" they were very fond of it indeed . "
" i do n't wonder .
so restful and <name> .
i do n't see how they could have brought themselves to part with it . "
now it is one of the most constant peculiarities of the english that in polite conversation  and i had striven to be polite  no one ever does or sells anything for mere money 's sake .
" miss <name>  the youngest  fell ill " ( he <unk> his words a little ) , " and , as they were very much attached to each other , that broke up the home . "
" naturally .
i fancied it must have been something of that kind .
one does n't associate the staffordshire <unk> " ( my demon of <unk> at that instant created 'em ) , " with  with being hard up . "
" i do n't know whether we 're related to them , " he answered <unk> .
" we may be , for our branch of the family comes from the <unk> . "
i give this talk at length , because i am so proud of my first attempt at detective work .
when i left him , twenty minutes later , with instructions to move against the owner of holmescroft , with a view to purchase , i was more bewildered than any doctor watson at the opening of a story .
why should a middle-aged solicitor turn <unk> ' egg colour and drop his jaw when reminded of so innocent and <unk> a matter as that no death had ever occurred in a house that he had sold ?
if i knew my english vocabulary at all , the tone in which he said the youngest sister " fell ill " meant that she had gone out of her mind .
that might explain his change of countenance , and it was just possible that her <unk> influence still <name> about holmescroft ; but the rest was beyond me .
i was relieved when i reached m'leod 's city office , and could tell him what i had done  not what i thought .
m'leod was quite willing to enter into the game of the pretended purchase , but did not see how it would help if i knew baxter .
" he 's the only living soul i can get at who was connected with holmescroft , " i said .
" ah !
living soul is good , " said m'leod .
" at any rate our little girl <name> be pleased that you are still interested in us .
wo n't you come down some day this week ? "
" how is it there now ? "
i asked .
he screwed up his face .
" simply frightful ! "
he said .
" <name> is at <unk> . "
" i should like it immensely , but i must cultivate baxter for the present .
you 'll be sure and keep him busy your end , wo n't you ? "
he looked at me with quiet contempt .
" do not be afraid .
i shall be a good jew .
i shall be my own solicitor . "
before a fortnight was over , baxter admitted ruefully that m'leod was better than most firms in the business : we buyers were <name> , <unk> , shocked at the price of holmescroft , inquisitive , and cold by turns , but mr. m'leod the seller easily met and surpassed us ; and mr. baxter entered every letter , telegram , and consultation at the proper rates in a <unk> of a <name> .
at the end of a month he said it looked as though m'leod , thanks to him , were really going to listen to reason .
i was many pounds out of pocket , but i had learned something of mr. baxter on the human side .
i deserved it .
never in my life have i worked to conciliate , amuse , and flatter a human being as i worked over my solicitor .
it appeared that he <unk> .
therefore , i was an enthusiastic beginner , anxious to learn .
twice i invaded his office with a bag ( m'leod lent it ) full of the <unk> needed in this detestable game , and a vocabulary to match .
the third time the ice broke , and mr. baxter took me to his links , quite ten miles off , where in a maze of <unk> lines , railroads , and <unk> , we <unk> our <unk> way round nine holes like barges plunging through head seas .
he played <unk> and had never expected to meet any one worse ; but as he realised my form , i think he began to like me , for he took me in hand by the two hours together .
after a fortnight he could give me no more than a stroke a hole , and when , with this allowance , i once managed to beat him by one , he was honestly glad , and assured me that i should be a <unk> if i stuck to it .
i was sticking to it for my own ends , but now and again my conscience pricked me ; for the man was a nice man .
between games he supplied me with odd pieces of evidence , such as that he had known the <unk> all his life , being their cousin , and that miss <name> , the eldest , was an <unk> woman who would never let bygones be .
i naturally wondered what she might have against him ; and somehow connected him <unk> with mad <name> .
" people ought to forgive and forget , " he volunteered one day between rounds .
" specially where , in the nature of things , they ca n't be sure of their deductions .
do n't you think so ? "
" it all depends on the nature of the evidence on which one forms one's judgment , " i answered .
" nonsense ! "
he cried .
" i 'm lawyer enough to know that there 's nothing in the world so misleading as circumstantial evidence .
never was . "
" why ?
have you ever seen men hanged on it ? "
" hanged ?
people have been supposed to be eternally lost on it , " his face turned grey again .
" i do n't know how it is with you , but my consolation is that god must know .
he must !
things that seem on the face of 'em like murder , or say suicide , may appear different to god .
heh ? "
" that 's what the murderer and the suicide can always <name>  i suppose . "
" i have expressed myself clumsily as usual .
the facts as god knows 'em  may be different  even after the most <unk> evidence .
i've always said that  both as a lawyer and a man , but some people wo n't  i do n't want to judge 'em  we 'll say they ca n't  believe it ; whereas i say there 's always a working chance  a certainty  that the worst hasn't happened . "
he stopped and cleared his throat .
" now , let 's come on !
this time next week i shall be taking my holiday . "
" what links ? "
i asked carelessly , while twins in a <unk> got out of our line of fire .
" a <unk> little <unk> affair at a <unk> in the <unk> .
my cousins stay there .
always <name> .
not but what the fourth and the seventh holes take some doing .
you could manage it , though , " he said encouragingly .
" you 're doing much better .
it 's only your approach shots that are weak . "
" you 're right .
i ca n't approach for nuts !
i shall go to pieces while you 're away  with no one to coach me , " i said mournfully .
" i have n't taught you anything , " he said , delighted with the compliment .
" i owe all i 've learned to you , anyhow .
when <name> you come back ? "
" look here , " he began .
" i do n't know , your engagements , but i 've no one to play with at <unk> mills .
never have .
why could n't you take a few days off and join me there ?
i warn you it <name> be rather dull .
it 's a throat and gout <unk> , <unk> , electricity , and so forth .
but the fourth and the seventh holes really take some doing . "
" i 'm for the game , " i answered valiantly ; heaven well knowing that i hated every stroke and word of it .
" that 's the proper spirit .
as their lawyer i must ask you not to say anything to my cousins about holmescroft .
it <unk> 'em .
always did .
but speaking as man to man , it would be very pleasant for me if you could see your way to  " i saw it as soon as decency permitted , and thanked him sincerely .
according to my now well-developed theory he had certainly <unk> his aged cousins ' <unk> under power of attorney , and had probably driven poor <name> moultrie out of her wits , but i wished that he was not so gentle , and good-tempered , and innocent eyed .
before i joined him at <unk> mills <unk> , i spent a night at holmescroft .
miss m'leod had returned from her <unk> , and first we made very <name> on the open lawn in the <name> over the manners and customs of the english resorting to such places .
she knew dozens of <unk> , and warned me how to behave in them , while mr. and mrs. m'leod stood aside and adored her .
" ah !
that 's the way she always comes back to us , " he said .
" pity it wears off so soon , ai n't it ?
you ought to hear her sing 'with mirth thou pretty bird . ' "
we had the house to face through the evening , and there we neither laughed nor <name> .
the gloom fell on us as we entered , and did not shift till ten o'clock , when we crawled out , as it were , from beneath it .
" it has been bad this summer , " said mrs. m'leod in a whisper after we realised that we were freed .
" sometimes i think the house <name> get up and cry out  it is so bad . "
" how ? "
" have you forgotten what comes after the depression ? "
so then we waited about the small fire , and the dead air in the room presently filled and pressed down upon us with the sensation ( but words are useless here ) as though some dumb and bound power were striving against gag and bond to deliver its soul of an articulate word .
it passed in a few minutes , and i fell to thinking about mr. <unk> conscience and <name> moultrie , gone mad in the <unk> bedroom that waited me .
these reflections secured me a night during which i <unk> how , from purely mental causes , a man can be physically sick ; but the sickness was bliss compared to my dreams when the birds waked .
on my departure , m'leod gave me a beautiful <unk> 's horn , much as a nurse gives a child sweets for being brave at a dentist 's .
" there 's no duplicate of it in the world , " he said , " else it would have come to old <name> m'leod ; " and he tucked it into the motor .
miss m'leod on the far side of the car whispered , " have you found out anything , mr .
<unk> ? "
i shook my head .
" then i shall be chained to my rock all my life , " she went on .
" only do n't tell papa . "
i supposed she was thinking of the young gentleman who specialised in south american rails , for i noticed a ring on the third finger of her left hand .
i went straight from that house to <unk> mills <unk> , keen for the first time in my life on playing golf , which is guaranteed to occupy the mind .
baxter had taken me a room communicating with his own , and after lunch introduced me to a tall , <unk> elderly <name> of decided manners , whom a white-haired maid pushed along in a <unk> through the <unk> grounds of the <unk> .
she was miss <name> moultrie , and she coughed and cleared her throat just like baxter .
she suffered  she told me it was a moultrie <unk>  from some obscure form of chronic <unk> , complicated with spasm of the <unk> ; and , in a dead , flat voice , with a sunken eye that looked and saw not , told me what washes , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> she had proved most beneficial .
from her i was passed on to her younger sister , miss <name> , a small and withered thing with twitching lips , victim , she told me , to very much the same sort of throat , but secretly devoted to another set of medicines .
when she went away with baxter and the <unk> , i fell across a <name> of the indian army with gout in his glassy eyes , and a stomach which he had taken all round the continent .
he laid everything before me ; and him i escaped only to be confided in by a matron with a tendency to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
baxter waited hand and foot on his cousins till five o'clock , trying , as i saw , to atone for his treatment of the dead sister .
miss <name> ordered him about like a dog .
" i warned you it would be dull , " he said when we met in the smoking-room .
" it 's tremendously interesting , " i said .
" but how about a look round the links ? "
" unluckily damp always affects my eldest cousin .
i 've got to buy her a new <unk> .
<unk> broke her old one yesterday . "
we slipped out to the chemist 's shop in the town , and he bought a large glittering tin thing whose workings he explained .
" i 'm used to this sort of work .
i come up here pretty often , " he said .
" i 've the family throat too . "
" you 're a good man , " i said .
" a very good man . "
he turned towards me in the evening light among the <unk> , and his face was changed to what it might have been a generation before .
" you see , " he said huskily , " there was the youngest  <name> .
before she fell ill , you know .
but she did n't like leaving her sisters .
never would . "
he hurried on with his <unk> load and left me among the ruins of my black theories .
the man with that face had done <name> moultrie no wrong .
we never played our game .
i was waked between two and three in the morning from my <unk> bed by baxter in an ulster over orange and white pyjamas , which i should never have suspected from his character .
" my cousin has had some sort of a seizure , " he said .
" <name> you come ?
i do n't want to wake the doctor .
do n't want to make a scandal .
quick ! "
so i came quickly , and led by the white-haired <unk> in a jacket and petticoat , entered a <unk> room reeking with steam and <unk> <unk> .
the electrics were all on .
miss <name>  i knew her by her height  was at the open window , wrestling with miss <name> , who gripped her round the knees .
miss <name> 's hand was at her own throat , which was streaked with blood .
" she 's done it .
she 's done it too ! "
miss <name> panted .
" hold her !
help me ! "
" oh , i say !
women do n't cut their throats , " baxter whispered .
" my god !
has she cut her throat ? "
the maid cried out , and with no warning rolled over in a faint .
baxter pushed her under the <unk> , and leaped to hold the gaunt woman who crowed and whistled as she struggled toward the window .
he took her by the shoulder , and she struck out wildly : " all right !
she 's only cut her hand , " he said .
" wet towel quick ! "
while i got that he pushed her backward .
her strength seemed almost as great as his .
i <unk> at her throat when i could , and found no <name> ; then helped him to control her a little .
miss <name> leaped back to bed , wailing like a child .
" tie up her hand somehow , " said baxter .
" do n't let it drip about the place .
she "  he stepped on broken glass in his slippers , " she must have smashed a pane . "
miss <name> lurched towards the open window again , dropped on her knees , her head on the sill , and lay quiet , surrendering the cut hand to me .
" what did she do ? "
baxter turned towards miss <name> in the far bed .
" she was going to throw herself out of the window , " was the answer .
" i stopped her , and sent <unk> for you .
oh , we can never hold up our heads again ! "
miss <name> writhed and fought for breath .
baxter found a shawl which he threw over her shoulders .
" nonsense ! "
said he .
" that is n't like <name> ; " but his face worked when he said it .
" you would n't believe about aggie , <name> .
perhaps you <name> now ! "
said miss <name> .
" i saw her do it , and she 's cut her throat too ! "
" she has n't , " i said .
" it 's only her hand . "
miss <name> suddenly broke from us with an indescribable grunt , flew , rather than ran , to her sister 's bed , and there shook her as one furious <unk> would shake another .
" no such thing , " she croaked .
" how dare you think so , you wicked little fool ? "
" get into bed , <name> , " said baxter .
" you 'll catch a chill . "
she obeyed , but sat up with the grey shawl round her <name> shoulders , glaring at her sister .
" i 'm better now , " she panted .
" <unk> let me sit out too long .
where 's <unk> ?
the kettle . "
" never mind <unk> , " said baxter .
" you get the kettle . "
i hastened to bring it from the side table .
" now , <name> , as god sees you , tell me what you 've done . "
his lips were dry , and he could not <unk> .
them with his tongue .
miss <name> applied herself to the mouth of the kettle , and between <unk> of steam said : " the spasm came on just now , while i was asleep .
i was nearly choking to death .
so i went to the window i 've done it often before , without , waking any one .
<name> 's such an old maid about draughts .
i tell you i was choking to death .
i could n't manage the catch , and i nearly fell out .
that window opens too low .
i cut my hand trying to save myself .
who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief ?
i wish you had had my throat , <name> .
i never was nearer dying ! "
she scowled on us all impartially , while her sister sobbed .
from the bottom of the bed we heard a quivering voice : " is she dead ?
have they took her away ?
oh , i never could bear the sight o ' blood ! "
" <unk> , " said miss <name> , " you are an hireling .
go away ! "
it is my belief that <unk> crawled out on all fours , but i was busy picking up broken glass from the carpet .
then baxter , seated by the side of the bed , began to <unk> in a voice i scarcely recognised .
no one could for an instant have doubted the genuine rage of miss <name> against her sister , her cousin , or her maid ; and that a doctor should have been called in for she did me the honour of calling me doctor  was the last drop .
she was choking with her throat ; had rushed to the window for air ; had near pitched out , and in catching at the window bars had cut her hand .
over and over she made this clear to the intent baxter .
then she turned on her sister and <unk> her savagely .
" you must n't blame me , " miss <name> faltered at last .
" you know what we think of night and day . " .
" i 'm coming to that , " said baxter .
" listen to me .
what you did , <name> , misled four people into thinking you  you meant to do away with yourself . "
" is n't one suicide in the family enough ?
oh god , help and pity us !
you could n't have believed that ! "
she cried .
" the evidence was complete .
now , do n't you think , " baxter 's finger wagged under her nose  " ca n't you think that poor aggie did the same thing at holmescroft when she fell out of the window ? "
" she had the same throat , " said miss <name> .
" exactly the same symptoms .
do n't you remember , <name> ? "
" which was her bedroom ? "
i asked of baxter in an undertone .
" over the south verandah , looking on to the tennis lawn . "
" i nearly fell out of that very window when i was at holmescroft  opening it to get some air .
the sill does n't come much above your knees , " i said .
" you hear that , <name> ?
<name> , do you hear what this gentleman says ?
won't you believe that what nearly happened to you must have happened to poor aggie that night ?
for god 's sake  for her sake  <name> , wo n't you believe ? "
there was a long silence while the steam kettle puffed .
" if i could have proof  if i could have proof , " said she , and broke into most horrible tears .
baxter motioned to me , and i crept away to my room , and lay awake till morning , thinking more specially of the dumb thing at holmescroft which wished to explain itself .
i hated miss <name> as perfectly as though i had known her for twenty years , but i felt that , alive or dead , i should not like her to condemn me .
yet at mid-day , when i saw miss <name> in her <unk> , <unk> behind and baxter and miss <name> on either side , in the <unk> grounds of the <unk> , i found it difficult to arrange my words .
" now that you know all about it , " said baxter aside , after the first strangeness of our meeting was over , " it 's only fair to tell you that my poor cousin did not die in holmescroft at all .
she was dead when they found her under the window in the morning .
just dead . "
" under that laburnum outside the window ? "
i asked , for i suddenly remembered the crooked evil thing .
" exactly .
she broke the tree in falling .
but no death has ever taken place in the house , so far as we were concerned .
you can make yourself quite easy on that point .
mr. m'leod 's extra thousand for what you called the <unk> <name> of health ' was something toward my <unk> estate when we sold .
it was my duty as their lawyer to get it for them  at any cost to my own feelings . "
i know better than to argue when the english talk about their duty .
so i agreed with my solicitor .
" their sister 's death must have been a great blow to your cousins , " i went on .
the <unk> was behind me .
" unspeakable , " baxter whispered .
" they brooded on it day and night .
no wonder .
if their theory of poor aggie making away with herself was correct , she was eternally lost ! "
" do you believe that she made away with herself ? "
" no , thank god !
never have !
and after what happened to <name> last night , i see perfectly what happened to poor aggie .
she had the family throat too .
by the way , <name> thinks you are a doctor .
otherwise she wouldn't like your having been in her room . "
" very good .
is she convinced now about her sister 's death ? "
" she 'd give anything to be able to believe it , but she 's a hard woman , and brooding along certain lines makes one <unk> .
i have sometimes been afraid of her reason  on the religious side , do n't you know .
<name> does n't matter .
<name> of a hen .
always had . "
here <unk> summoned me to the <unk> , and the ravaged face , beneath its knitted shetland wool hood , of miss <name> moultrie .
" i need not remind you , i <name> , of the seal of secrecy  absolute secrecy  in your profession , " she began .
" thanks to my cousin 's and my sister 's stupidity , you have found out , " she blew her nose .
" please do n't excite her , sir , " said <unk> at the back .
" but , my dear miss moultrie , i only know what i 've seen , of course , but it seems to me that what you thought was a tragedy in your <unk> case , turns out , on your own evidence , so to speak , to have been an accident  a dreadfully sad one  but absolutely an accident . "
" do you believe that too ? "
she cried .
" or are you only saying it to comfort me ? "
" i believe it from the bottom of my heart .
come down to holmescroft for an hour  for half an hour and satisfy yourself . "
" of what ?
you do n't understand .
i see the house every <unk> night .
i am always there in spirit  waking or sleeping .
i could n't face it in reality . "
" but you must , " i said .
" if you go there in the spirit the greater need for you to go there in the flesh .
go to your sister 's room once more , and see the window  i nearly fell out of it myself .
it 's  it 's awfully low and dangerous .
that would convince you , " i pleaded .
" yet aggie had slept in that room for years , " she interrupted .
" you 've slept in your room here for a long time , have n't you ?
but you nearly fell out of the window when you were choking . "
" that is true .
that is one thing true , " she nodded .
" and i might have been killed as  perhaps aggie was killed . "
" in that case your own sister and cousin and maid would have said you had committed suicide , miss moultrie .
come down to holmescroft , and go over the place just once . "
" you are lying , " she said quite quietly .
" you do n't want me to come down to see a window .
it is something else .
i warn you we are <unk> .
we do n't believe in prayers for the dead .
'as the tree falls  ' " " yes .
i daresay .
but you persist in thinking that your sister committed suicide  " " no !
no !
i have always prayed that i might have misjudged her . "
<unk> at the <unk> spoke up : " oh , miss <name> !
you would 'ave it from the first that poor miss aggie 'ad made away with herself ; an ' , of course , miss <name> took the notion from you : only master  mister <name> stood out ,  and  and i 'd 'ave taken my bible oath you was making away with yourself last night . "
miss <name> leaned towards me , one finger on my sleeve .
" if going to holmescroft kills me , " she said , " you <name> have the murder of a fellow-creature on your conscience for all eternity . "
" i 'll risk it , " i answered .
remembering what torment the mere reflection of her torments had cast on holmescroft , and remembering , above all , the dumb thing that filled the house with its <name> to speak , i felt that there might be worse things .
baxter was amazed at the proposed visit , but at a nod from that terrible woman went off to make arrangements .
then i sent a telegram to m'leod bidding him and his vacate holmescroft for that afternoon .
miss <name> should be alone with her dead , as i had been alone .
i expected untold trouble in transporting her , but to do her justice , the promise given for the journey , she underwent it without murmur , spasm , or unnecessary word .
miss <name> , pressed in a corner by the window , wept behind her veil , and from time to time tried to take hold of her sister 's hand .
baxter wrapped himself in his newly found happiness as <unk> as a bridegroom , for he sat still and smiled .
" so long as i know that aggie did n't make away with herself , " he explained , " i tell you frankly i do n't care what happened .
she 's as hard as a rock  <name> .
always was .
she wo n't die . "
we led her out on to the platform like a blind woman , and so got her into the fly .
the half-hour crawl to holmescroft was the most racking experience of the day .
m'leod had obeyed my instructions .
there was no one visible in the house or the gardens ; and the front door stood open .
miss <name> rose from beside her sister , stepped forth first , and entered the hall .
" come , <name> , " she cried .
" i dare n't .
oh , i dare n't . "
" come ! "
her voice had altered .
i felt baxter start .
" there 's nothing to be afraid of . "
" good heavens ! "
said baxter .
" she 's running up the stairs .
we 'd better follow . "
" let 's wait below .
she 's going to the room . "
we heard the door of the bedroom i knew open and shut , and we waited in the <unk> hall , heavy with the scent of flowers .
" i 've never been into it since it was sold , " baxter sighed .
" what a lovely , restful plate it is !
poor aggie used to arrange the flowers . "
" restful ? "
i began , but stopped of a sudden , for i felt all over my bruised soul that baxter was speaking truth .
it was a light , spacious , airy house , full of the sense of well-being and peace  above all things , of peace .
i ventured into the dining-room where the thoughtful <unk> had left a small fire .
there was no terror there , present or lurking ; and in the drawing-room , which for good reasons we had never cared to enter , the sun and the peace and the scent of the flowers worked together as is fit in an inhabited house .
when i returned to the hall , baxter was sweetly asleep on a couch , looking most unlike a middle-aged solicitor who had spent a broken night with an exacting cousin .
there was ample time for me to review it all  to <unk> myself upon my magnificent <unk> ( barring some errors about baxter as a thief and possibly a murderer ) , before the door above opened , and baxter , evidently a light sleeper , sprang awake .
" i 've had a heavenly little nap , " he said , rubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands like a child .
" good lord !
that 's not their step ! "
but it was .
i had never before been privileged to see the shadow turned backward on the dial  the years ripped bodily off poor human shoulders  old sunken eyes filled and alight  harsh lips moistened and human .
" <name> , " miss <name> called , " i know now .
aggie did n't do it ! "
and " she did n't do it ! "
echoed miss <name> .
" i did not think it wrong to say a prayer , " miss <name> continued .
" not for her soul , but for our peace .
then i was convinced . "
" then we got conviction , " the younger sister piped .
" we 've misjudged poor aggie , <name> .
but i feel she knows now .
wherever she is , she knows that we know she is <unk> . "
" yes , she knows .
i felt it too , " said miss <name> .
" i never doubted , " said <name> ' baxter , whose face was beautiful at that hour .
" not from the first .
never have ! "
" you never offered me proof , <name> .
now , thank god , it <name> not be the same any more .
i can think henceforward of aggie without sorrow . "
she tripped , absolutely tripped , across the hall .
" what ideas these jews have of arranging furniture ! "
she spied me behind a big <unk> vase .
" i 've seen the window , " she said remotely .
" you took a great risk in advising me to undertake such a journey .
however , as it turns out ...
i forgive you , and i pray you may never know what mental anguish means !
<name> !
look at this peculiar piano !
do you suppose , doctor , these people would offer one tea ?
i miss mine . "
" i <name> go and see , " i said , and explored m'leod 's <unk> <unk> wing .
it was in the servants ' hall that i unearthed the m'leod family , bursting with anxiety .
" tea for three , quick , " i said .
" if you ask me any questions now , i shall have a fit ! "
so mrs. m'leod got it , and i was butler , amid murmured apologies from baxter , still smiling and <unk> , and the cold disapproval of miss <name> , who thought the pattern of the <name> vulgar .
however , she ate well , and even asked me whether i would not like a cup of tea for myself .
they went away in the twilight  the twilight that i had once feared .
they were going to an hotel in london to rest after the fatigues of the day , and as their fly turned down the drive , i capered on the door step , with the <unk> house behind me .
then i heard the uncertain feet of the <unk> and bade them not to turn on the lights , but to feel  to feel what i had done ; for the shadow was gone , with the dumb <name> in the air .
they <name> short , but afterwards deeper , breaths , like <unk> entering chill water , separated one from the other , moved about the hall , tiptoed upstairs , raced down , and then miss m'leod , and i believe her mother , though she denies this , embraced me .
i know m'leod did .
it was a disgraceful evening .
to say we <unk> through the house is to put it mildly .
we played a sort of blind man 's buff along the darkest passages , in the unlighted drawing-room , and little dining-room , calling cheerily to each other after each exploration that here , and here , and here , the <unk> removed itself .
we came up to the bedroom  mine for the night again  and sat , the women on the bed , and we men on chairs , drinking in blessed draughts of peace and comfort and cleanliness of soul , while i told them my tale in full , and received fresh praise , thanks , and blessings .
when the servants , returned from their day 's outing , gave us a supper of cold fried fish , m'leod had sense enough to open no wine .
we had been practically drunk since nightfall , and grew incoherent on water and milk .
" i like that baxter , " said m'leod .
" he 's a sharp man .
the death wasn't in the house , but he ran it pretty close , ai n't it ? "
" and the joke of it is that he supposes i want to buy the place from you , " i said .
" are you selling ? "
" not for twice what i paid for it  now , " said m'leod .
" i 'll keep you in furs all your life , but not our holmescroft . "
" no  never our holmescroft , " said miss m'leod .
" we 'll ask him here on tuesday , mamma . "
they squeezed each other 's hands .
" now tell me , " said mrs. m'leod  " that tall one , i saw out of the <unk> window  did she tell you she was always here in the spirit ?
i hate her .
she made all this trouble .
it was not her house after she had sold it .
what do you think ? "
" i suppose , " i answered , " she brooded over what she believed was her sister 's suicide night and day  she confessed she did  and her thoughts being concentrated on this place , they felt like a  like a burning glass . "
" burning glass is good , " said m'leod .
" i said it was like a light of blackness turned on us , " cried the girl , <unk> her ring .
" that must have been when the tall one thought worst about her sister and the house . "
" ah , the poor aggie ! "
said mrs. m'leod .
" the poor aggie , trying to tell every one it was not so !
no wonder we felt something wished to say something .
<name> , <name> , do you remember that night ? "
" we need not remember any more , " m'leod interrupted .
" it is not our trouble .
they have told each other now . "
" do you think , then , " said miss m'leod , " that those two , the living ones , were actually told something  upstairs  in your in the room ? "
" i ca n't say .
at any rate they were made happy , and they ate a big tea afterwards .
as your father says , it is not our trouble any longer  thank god ! "
" amen ! "
said m'leod .
" now , <name> , let us have some music after all these months .
'with mirth , thou pretty bird , ' ai n't it ?
you ought to hear that . "
and in the <unk> hall , <name> sang an old english song that i had never heard before .
with mirth , thou pretty bird , rejoice thy maker 's praise enhanced ; lift up thy shrill and pleasant voice , thy god is high advanced !
thy food before he did provide , and gives it in a fitting side , wherewith be thou sufficed !
why shouldst thou now unpleasant be , thy wrath against god <unk> , that he a little bird made thee , thy silly head tormenting , because he made thee not a man ?
oh , peace !
he hath well thought thereon , therewith be thou sufficed !
the <unk> 's song if thought can reach to heaven , on heaven let it dwell , for fear that thought be given like power to reach to hell .
for fear the desolation and darkness of thy mind , perplex an habitation which thou hast left behind .
let nothing linger after  no whispering ghost remain , in wall , or beam , or <unk> , of any hate or pain : cleanse and call home thy spirit , deny her leave to cast , on aught thy heirs inherit , the shadow of her past .
for think , in all thy sadness , what road our griefs may take ; whose <name> reflect our madness , or whom our terrors shake .
for think , lest any <unk> by cause of thy distress the arrows of our anguish fly farther than we guess .
our lives , our tears , as water , are spilled upon the ground ; god giveth no man quarter , yet god a means hath found ; though <name> and <name> have vanished , and even love grows dim ; a means whereby his banished be not expelled from him !
american notes by rudyard kipling with introduction introduction in an issue of the london world in <name> , 1890 , there appeared the following paragraph : " two small rooms connected by a <name> hall afford sufficient space to contain mr. rudyard kipling , the literary hero of the present hour , 'the man who came from nowhere , ' as he says himself , and who a year ago was consciously nothing in the literary world . "
six months previous to this mr. kipling , then but twenty-four years old , had arrived in england from <name> to find that fame had preceded him .
he had already gained fame in <name> , where scores of cultured and critical people , after reading " departmental ditties , " " plain tales from the hills , " and various other stories and verses , had stamped him for a genius .
fortunately for everybody who reads , london interested and stimulated mr. kipling , and he settled down to writing .
" the record of <unk> <unk> , " and his first novel , " the light that failed , " appeared in 1890 and 1891 ; then a collection of verse , " life 's handicap , being stories of mine own people , " was published simultaneously in london and new york city ; then followed more verse , and so on through an <unk> series .
in 1891 mr. kipling met the young author <unk> <unk> , at that time connected with a london publishing house .
a strong attachment grew between the two , and several months after their first meeting they came to mr. <unk> 's vermont home , where they <unk> on " the <unk> : a story of west and east , " for which the century paid the largest price ever given by an american magazine for a story .
the following year mr. kipling married mr. <unk> 's sister in london and brought her to <name> .
the <unk> were of an aristocratic new york family ; the grandfather of mrs. kipling was j. m. <unk> , a prominent lawyer in new york city and chicago , who died in 1888 , leaving a fortune of about a million .
her maternal grandfather was e. <unk> smith of <unk> , n. y. , a noted author and <unk> , who was selected in 1871 by secretary hamilton fish to go to japan as the mikado 's adviser in international law .
the ancestral home of the <unk> was near <unk> ' , <unk> , and here mr. kipling brought his bride .
the young englishman was so impressed by the vermont scenery that he rented for a time the cottage on the " bliss farm , " in which <unk> <unk> the <unk> wrote the well known drama " <name> <unk> . "
the next spring mr. kipling purchased from his brother-in-law , beatty <unk> , a tract of land about three miles north of <unk> ' , <unk> , and on this erected a house at a cost of nearly $ 50,000 , which he named " the <unk> . "
this was his home during his sojourn in <name> .
here he wrote when in the mood , and for recreation tramped abroad over the hills .
his social duties at this period were not arduous , for to his home he refused admittance to all but tried friends .
he made a study of the yankee country dialect and character for " the walking delegate , " and while " captains courageous , " the story of new england fisher life , was before him he spent some time among the gloucester fishermen with an acquaintance who had access to the household gods of these people .
he returned to england in <name> , 1896 , and did not visit <name> again till 1899 , when he came with his wife and three children for a limited time .
it is hardly fair to mr. kipling to call " american notes " first impressions , for one reading them <name> readily see that the impressions are superficial , little thought being put upon the writing .
they seem <unk> , and would lead one to believe that mr. kipling is antagonistic to <name> in every respect .
this , however , is not true .
these " notes " aroused much protest and severe criticism when they appeared in 1891 , and are considered so far beneath mr. kipling 's real work that they have been nearly suppressed and are rarely found in a list of his writings .
their very caustic style is of interest to a student and lover of kipling , and for this reason the publishers believe them worthy of a good binding .
g. p. t. contents at the golden gate american politics american salmon the yellowstone chicago the american army <name> 's defenceless coasts i .
at the golden gate " serene , indifferent to fate , thou <unk> at the western gate ; thou seest the white seas fold their tents , oh , <unk> of two continents ; thou <unk> all things , small and great , to thee , beside the western gate . "
this is what <name> harte has written of the great city of san <name> , and for the past fortnight i have been wondering what made him do it .
there is neither serenity nor indifference to be found in these parts ; and evil would it be for the continents whose <unk> were intrusted to so reckless a guardian .
behold me pitched <unk> from twenty days of the high seas into the whirl of california , deprived of any guidance , and left to draw my own conclusions .
protect me from the wrath of an outraged community if these letters be ever read by american eyes !
san <name> is a mad city  inhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people , whose women are of a remarkable beauty .
when the " city of pekin " steamed through the golden gate , i saw with great <name> that the <unk> which guarded the mouth of the " finest harbor in the world , sir , " could be silenced by two gunboats from <name> <unk> with safety , comfort , and despatch .
also , there was not a single american vessel of war in the harbor .
this may sound bloodthirsty ; but remember , i had come with a grievance upon me  the grievance of the <unk> english books .
then a reporter leaped aboard , and ere i could gasp held me in his toils .
he pumped me exhaustively while i was getting ashore , demanding of all things in the world news about indian journalism .
it is an awful thing to enter a new land with a new lie on your lips .
i spoke the truth to the <unk> custom house man who turned my most sacred raiment on a floor composed of stable refuse and pine splinters ; but the reporter overwhelmed me not so much by his poignant audacity as his beautiful ignorance .
i am sorry now that i did not tell him more lies as i passed into a city of three hundred thousand white men .
think of it !
three hundred thousand white men and women gathered in one spot , walking upon real pavements in front of <unk> shops , and talking something that at first hearing was not very different from english .
it was only when i had tangled myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden houses , dust , street refuse , and children who played with empty kerosene tins , that i discovered the difference of speech .
" you want to go to the palace hotel ? "
said an affable youth on a dray .
" what in hell are you doing here , then ?
this is about the lowest <name> in the city .
go six blocks north to corner of <unk> and <unk> , then walk around till you strike corner of gutter and sixteenth , and that brings you there . "
i do not vouch for the literal accuracy of these directions , quoting but from a disordered memory .
" amen , " i said .
" but who am i that i should strike the corners of such as you name ?
peradventure they be gentlemen of repute , and might hit back .
bring it down to dots , my son . "
i thought he would have smitten me , but he did n't .
he explained that no one ever used the word " street , " and that every one was supposed to know how the streets ran , for sometimes the names were upon the lamps and sometimes they were n't .
fortified with these directions , i proceeded till i found a mighty street , full of sumptuous buildings four and five stories high , but paved with rude <unk> , after the fashion of the year 1 .
here a <unk> , without any visible means of support , slid stealthily behind me and nearly struck me in the back .
this was the famous cable car of san <name> , which runs by gripping an endless wire rope sunk in the ground , and of which i <name> tell you more anon .
a hundred yards further there was a slight commotion in the street , a gathering together of three or four , something that glittered as it moved very swiftly .
a ponderous <name> gentleman , with priest 's cords in his hat and a small nickel-plated badge on his fat bosom , emerged from the knot supporting a chinaman who had been stabbed in the eye and was bleeding like a pig .
the by-standers went their ways , and the chinaman , assisted by the policeman , his own .
of course this was none of my business , but i rather wanted to know what had happened to the gentleman who had dealt the stab .
it said a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangement of the town that a surging crowd did not at once block the street to see what was going forward .
i was the sixth man and the last who assisted at the performance , and my curiosity was six times the greatest .
indeed , i felt ashamed of showing it .
there were no more incidents till i reached the palace hotel , a <unk> <name> of humanity with a thousand rooms in it .
all the travel books <name> tell you about hotel arrangements in this country .
they should be seen to be appreciated .
understand clearly  and this letter is written after a thousand miles of experiences  that money <name> not buy you service in the west .
when the hotel clerk  the man who <unk> your room to you and who is supposed to give you information  when that resplendent individual stoops to attend to your wants he does so whistling or humming or picking his teeth , or pauses to converse with some one he knows .
these performances , i gather , are to impress upon you that he is a free man and your equal .
from his general appearance and the size of his diamonds he ought to be your superior .
there is no necessity for this swaggering self-consciousness of freedom .
business is business , and the man who is paid to attend to a man might reasonably devote his whole attention to the job .
out of office hours he can take his coach and four and <unk> society if he pleases .
in a vast <unk> hall , under the glare of an electric light , sat forty or fifty men , and for their use and amusement were provided <unk> of infinite capacity and generous gape .
most of the men wore <unk> and <unk>  the things that we in <name> put on at a <unk> , if we possess them  but they all spat .
they spat on principle .
the <unk> were on the staircases , in each bedroom  yea , and in chambers even more sacred than these .
they chased one into retirement , but they blossomed in chiefest splendor round the bar , and they were all used , every reeking one of them .
just before i began to feel <unk> sick another reporter <unk> me .
what he wanted to know was the precise area of <name> in square miles .
i referred him to <unk> .
he had never heard of <unk> .
he wanted it from my own mouth , and i would not tell him .
then he swerved off , just like the other man , to details of journalism in our own country .
i ventured to suggest that the interior economy of a paper most concerned the people who worked it .
" that 's the very thing that interests us , " he said .
" have you got reporters anything like our reporters on indian newspapers ? "
" we have not , " i said , and suppressed the " thank god " rising to my lips .
" why have n't you ? "
said he .
" because they would die , " i said .
it was exactly like talking to a child  a very rude little child .
he would begin almost every sentence with , " now tell me something about <name> , " and would turn aimlessly from one question to the other without the least continuity .
i was not angry , but keenly interested .
the man was a revelation to me .
to his questions i returned answers <unk> and <unk> .
after all , it really did not matter what i said .
he could not understand .
i can only <name> and pray that none of the readers of the " pioneer " <name> ever see that portentous interview .
the man made me out to be an idiot several sizes more <unk> than my <name> intended , and the <unk> of his ignorance managed to <unk> the few poor facts with which i supplied him into large and elaborate lies .
then , thought i , " the matter of american journalism shall be looked into later on .
at present i <name> enjoy myself . "
no man rose to tell me what were the lions of the place .
no one volunteered any sort of conveyance .
i was absolutely alone in this big city of white folk .
by instinct i sought refreshment , and came upon a <unk> full of bad salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were <unk> food from a counter .
it was the institution of the " free lunch " i had struck .
you paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat .
for something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in san <name> , even though he be a bankrupt .
remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts .
later i began a vast but <unk> exploration of the streets .
i asked for no names .
it was enough that the pavements were full of white men and women , the streets clanging with traffic , and that the restful roar of a great city rang in my ears .
the cable cars glided to all points of the compass at once .
i took them one by one till i could go no further .
san <name> has been pitched down on the sand bunkers of the <unk> desert .
about one fourth of it is ground reclaimed from the sea  any <unk> <name> tell you all about that .
the remainder is just ragged , <unk> sand hills , to-day pegged down by houses .
from an english point of view there has not been the least attempt at <unk> those hills , and indeed you might as well try to grade the hillocks of sind .
the cable cars have for all practical purposes made san <name> a dead level .
they take no count of rise or fall , but slide <unk> on their appointed courses from one end to the other of a <unk> street .
they turn corners almost at right angles , cross other lines , and for aught i know may run up the sides of houses .
there is no visible agency of their flight , but once in awhile you shall pass a <unk> building humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wire cable , and the initiated <name> tell you that here is the mechanism .
i gave up asking questions .
if it pleases providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles , and if for twopence <unk> i can ride in that car , why shall i seek the reasons of the miracle ?
rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood ( to imitate stone ) , each house just big enough for a man and his family .
let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us , their ancestors .
it grieves me now that i cursed them ( in the matter of book piracy ) , because i perceived that my curse is working and that their speech is becoming a horror already .
they <unk> themselves into the belief that they talk english  the english  and i have already been pitied for speaking with " an english accent . "
the man who pitied me spoke , so far as i was concerned , the language of thieves .
and they all do .
where we put the accent forward they throw it back , and vice <unk> where we give the long " a " they use the short , and words so simple as to be past mistaking they pronounce somewhere up in the dome of their heads .
how do these things happen ?
<name> <name> holmes says that the yankee <unk> , the cider and the salt codfish of the eastern states , are responsible for what he calls a nasal accent .
i know better .
they stole books from across the water without paying for 'em , and the snort of delight was fixed in their nostrils forever by a just providence .
that is why they talk a foreign tongue to-day .
" cats is dogs , and rabbits is dogs , and so 's parrots .
but this 'ere tortoise is an insect , so there ai n't no charge , " as the old <name> said .
a hindoo is a hindoo and a brother to the man who knows his vernacular .
and a frenchman is french because he speaks his own language .
but the american has no language .
he is dialect , slang , <unk> , accent , and so forth .
now that i have heard their voices , all the beauty of <name> harte is being ruined for me , because i find myself catching through the roll of his <unk> prose the cadence of his peculiar <unk> .
get an american <name> to read to you " how <name> claus came to <unk> bar , " and see how much is , under her tongue , left of the beauty of the original .
but i am sorry for <name> harte .
it happened this way .
a reporter asked me what i thought of the city , and i made answer <unk> that it was hallowed ground to me , because of <name> harte .
that was true .
" well , " said the reporter , " <name> harte claims california , but california do n't claim <name> harte .
he 's been so long in england that he 's quite english .
have you seen our cracker factories or the new offices of the <unk> ' ? "
he could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man .
i never intended to curse the people with a <unk> so vast as this .
but let us return to our sheep  which means the <unk> of the <name> house .
they are the great show of san <name> .
you take a train which pulls up the middle of the street ( it killed two people the day before yesterday , being <unk> and driven absolutely regardless of consequences ) , and you pull up somewhere at the back of the city on the pacific beach .
originally the cliffs and their approaches must have been pretty , but they have been so carefully defiled with advertisements that they are now one big blistered <unk> .
a hundred yards from the shore stood a big rock covered with the carcasses of the sleek <unk> , who roared and rolled and <unk> in the spouting surges .
no bold man had painted the creatures sky-blue or advertised newspapers on their backs , wherefore they did not match the landscape , which was chiefly <unk> .
some day , perhaps , whatever sort of government may obtain in this country <name> make a restoration of the place and keep it clean and neat .
at present the sovereign people , of whom i have heard so much already , are <unk> cherries and painting the virtues of " little <unk> beans " all over it .
night fell over the pacific , and the white <unk> whipped through the streets , <unk> the splendors of the electric lights .
it is the use of this city , her men and women folk , to parade between the hours of eight and ten a certain street called <unk> street , where the finest shops are situated .
here the click of high heels on the pavement is loudest , here the lights are brightest , and here the thunder of the traffic is most overwhelming .
i watched young california , and saw that it was , at least , <unk> dressed , cheerful in manner , and <unk> in conversation .
also the women were very fair .
perhaps eighteen days aboard ship had something to do with my <unk> admiration .
the maidens were of generous build , large , well <unk> , and attired in raiment that even to my inexperienced eyes must have cost much .
<unk> street at nine o'clock levels all distinctions of rank as impartially as the grave .
again and again i loitered at the heels of a couple of resplendent beings , only to overhear , when i expected the level voice of culture , the <unk> " sez he , " " sez i " that is the <name> of the white <unk> all the world over .
this was depressing because , in spite of all that goes to the contrary , fine feathers ought to make fine birds .
there was wealth  unlimited wealth  in the streets , but not an accent that would not have been dear at fifty cents .
wherefore , revolving in my mind that these folk were barbarians , i was presently enlightened and made aware that they also were the heirs of all the ages , and civilized after all .
there appeared before me an affable stranger of prepossessing appearance , with a blue and an innocent eye .
addressing me by name , he claimed to have met me in new york , at the windsor , and to this claim i gave a qualified assent .
i did not remember the fact , but since he was so certain of it , why , then  i waited developments .
" and what did you think of indiana when you came through ? "
was the next question .
it revealed the mystery of previous acquaintance and one or two other things .
with reprehensible carelessness my friend of the <unk> eye had looked up the name of his victim in the hotel register , and read " indiana " for <name> .
the <unk> with which i had cursed his people extended to himself .
he could not imagine an englishman coming through the states from west to east instead of by the regularly ordained route .
my fear was that in his delight in finding me so responsive he would make remarks about new york and the windsor which i could not understand .
and , indeed , he <unk> in this direction once or twice , asking me what i thought of such and such streets , which from his tone i gathered to be anything but respectable .
it is trying to talk unknown new york in almost unknown san <name> .
but my friend was merciful .
he protested that i was one after his own heart , and pressed upon me rare and curious drinks at more than one bar .
these drinks i accepted with gratitude , as also the cigars with which his pockets were stored .
he would show me the life of the city .
having no <name> to watch a weary old play again , i evaded the offer and received in lieu of the devil 's instruction much coarse flattery .
curiously constituted is the soul of man .
knowing how and where this man lied , waiting idly for the <unk> , i was distinctly conscious , as he bubbled compliments in my ear , of soft thrills of gratified pride stealing from <unk> to <unk> .
i was wise , quoth he  anybody could see that with half an eye ; sagacious , versed in the ways of the world , an acquaintance to be desired ; one who had tasted the cup of life with discretion .
all this pleased me , and in a measure numbed the suspicion that was thoroughly aroused .
eventually the blue-eyed one discovered , nay , insisted , that i had a taste for cards ( this was clumsily worked in , but it was my fault , for in that i met him half-way and allowed him no chance of good acting ) .
hereupon i laid my head upon one side and <unk> unholy wisdom , quoting odds and ends of poker talk , all ludicrously <unk> .
my friend kept his countenance admirably , and well he might , for five minutes later we arrived , always by the purest of chance , at a place where we could play cards and also <unk> with louisiana state lottery tickets .
would i play ?
" nay , " said i , " for to me cards have neither meaning nor continuity ; but let us assume that i am going to play .
how would you and your friends get to work ?
would you play a straight game , or make me drunk , or  well , the fact is , i 'm a newspaper man , and i 'd be much obliged if you 'd let me know something about <unk> steering . "
my blue-eyed friend erected himself into an obelisk of profanity .
he cursed me by his gods  the right and left bower ; he even cursed the very good cigars he had given me .
but , the storm over , he quieted down and explained .
i apologized for causing him to waste an evening , and we spent a very pleasant time together .
<unk> , <unk> , and a too hasty rushing to conclusions , were the rocks that he had split on , but he got his revenge when he said :  " how would i play with you ?
from all the <unk> <unk> bosh you talked about poker , i 'd <name> ' played a straight game , and skinned you .
i would n't have taken the trouble to make you drunk .
you never knew anything of the game , but how i was mistaken in going to work on you , makes me sick . "
he glared at me as though i had done him an injury .
to-day i know how it is that year after year , week after week , the <unk> <unk> , who is the confidence trick and the <unk> man of other climes , secures his prey .
he <unk> them over with flattery as the snake <unk> the rabbit .
the incident depressed me because it showed i had left the innocent east far behind and was come to a country where a man must look out for himself .
the very hotels bristled with notices about keeping my door locked and depositing my valuables in a safe .
the white man in a lump is bad .
weeping softly for <unk> ( little i knew then that my heart was to be torn afresh from my bosom ) i fell asleep in the clanging hotel .
next morning i had entered upon the deferred inheritance .
there are no princes in <name>  at least with crowns on their heads  but a <unk> member of some <name> family received my letter of introduction .
ere the day closed i was a member of the two clubs , and booked for many engagements to dinner and party .
now , this <name> , upon whose financial operations be continual increase , had no reason , nor had the others , his friends , to put himself out for the sake of one briton more or less , but he rested not till he had accomplished all in my behalf that a mother could think of for her <unk> daughter .
do you know the bohemian club of san <name> ?
they say its fame extends over the world .
it was created , somewhat on the lines of the savage , by men who wrote or <name> things , and has blossomed into most <unk> luxury .
the ruler of the place is an owl  an owl standing upon a skull and <unk> , showing forth grimly the wisdom of the man of letters and the end of his hopes for immortality .
the owl stands on the staircase , a statue four feet high ; is carved in the <unk> , <unk> on the frescoed ceiling , is stamped on the note-paper , and hangs on the walls .
he is an ancient and honorable bird .
under his wing 'twas my privilege to meet with white men whose lives were not chained down to routine of toil , who wrote magazine articles instead of reading them hurriedly in the pauses of office-work , who painted pictures instead of contenting themselves with cheap <unk> picked up at another man 's sale of effects .
mine were all the rights of social intercourse , craft by craft , that <name> , <unk> <unk> of collectors , has swindled us out of .
treading soft carpets and breathing the incense of superior cigars , i wandered from room to room studying the paintings in which the members of the club had <unk> themselves , their associates , and their aims .
there was a slick french audacity about the workmanship of these men of toil unbending that went straight to the heart of the beholder .
and yet it was not altogether french .
a dry <unk> of treatment , almost dutch , marked the difference .
the men painted as they spoke  with certainty .
the club <unk> in <unk> which it calls " jinks "  high and low , at intervals  and each of these gatherings is faithfully portrayed in oils by hands that know their business .
in this club were no amateurs spoiling canvas , because they fancied they could handle oils without knowledge of shadows or anatomy  no gentleman of leisure ruining the temper of publishers and an already ruined market with attempts to write " because everybody writes something these days . "
my hosts were working , or had worked for their daily bread with pen or paint , and their talk for the most part was of the shop  <unk>  that is to say , delightful .
they extended a large hand of welcome , and were as brethren , and i did homage to the owl and listened to their talk .
an indian club about <unk> <name> yield , if properly worked , an abundant harvest of queer tales ; but at a gathering of americans from the uttermost ends of their own continent , the tales are larger , thicker , more <unk> , and even more azure than any indian variety .
tales of the war i heard told by an <unk> of the south over his evening drink to a colonel of the northern army , my <unk> , who had served as a trooper in the northern horse , throwing in <unk> from time to time .
" tales of the law , " which in this country is an amazingly elastic affair , followed from the lips of a judge .
forgive me for recording one tale that struck me as new .
it may interest the up-country bar in <name> .
once upon a time there was <unk> , a young lawyer , who feared not god , neither regarded the bench .
( name , age , and town of the man were given at great length . )
to him no case had ever come as a client , partly because he lived in a district where lynch law prevailed , and partly because the most desperate prisoner shrunk from <unk> himself to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
but in time there happened an aggravated murder  so bad , indeed , that by common consent the citizens decided , as a prelude to <unk> , to give the real law a chance .
they could , in fact , <unk> round that murder .
they met  the court in its shirt-sleeves  and against the raw square of the court house window a <unk> suggestive branch of a tree fretted the sky .
no one appeared for the prisoner , and , partly in jest , the court advised young <unk> to take up the case .
" the prisoner is <unk> , <name> , " said the court .
" the square thing to do would be for you to take him aside and do the best you can for him . "
court , jury , and witness then adjourned to the veranda , while <unk> led his client aside to the court house cells .
an hour passed ere the lawyer returned alone .
mutely the audience questioned .
" may it <unk> the <unk> , " said <unk> , " my client 's case is a <unk> one  a <unk> bad one .
you told me to do the <unk> i <unk> for him , judge , so i 've jest given him <unk> <unk> <unk> , an ' told him to light out for <unk> <unk> , my <unk> opinion being he 'd be hanged <unk> <unk> if he <unk> here .
<unk> this time my client 's 'bout fifteen mile out yonder somewheres .
that was the <unk> i could do for him , may it <unk> the court . "
the young man , escaping punishment in lieu of the prisoner , made his fortune ere five years .
other voices followed , with equally wondrous tales of <unk> in mexico and arizona , of gambling at army posts in texas , of newspaper wars waged in godless chicago ( i could not help being interested , but they were not pretty tricks ) , of deaths sudden and violent in montana and <name> , of the loves of half-breed maidens in the south , and fantastic <unk> for gold in mysterious alaska .
above all , they told the story of the building of old san <name> , when the " finest collection of humanity on god 's earth , sir , started this town , and the water came up to the foot of market street . "
very terrible were some of the tales , grimly humorous the others , and the men in broadcloth and fine linen who told them had played their parts in them .
" and now and again when things got too bad they would toll the city <name> , and the vigilance committee turned out and hanged the suspicious characters .
a man did n't begin to be suspected in those days till he had committed at least one <unk> murder , " said a <unk> , portly old gentleman .
i looked at the pictures around me , the noiseless , <unk> waiter behind me , the <unk> ceiling above , the <name> carpet beneath .
it was hard to realize that even twenty years ago you could see a man hanged with great pomp .
later on i found reason to change my opinion .
the tales gave me a headache and set me thinking .
how in the world was it possible to take in even one thousandth of this huge , roaring , <unk> continent ?
in the <unk> silence of the sumptuous library lay professor <name> 's book on the american republic .
" it is an omen , " said i .
" he has done all things in all seriousness , and he may be purchased for half a guinea .
those who <name> information of the most undoubted , must refer to his pages .
for me is the daily round of <unk> , the recording of the incidents of the hour and intercourse with the <unk> of the day .
i <name> not <unk> this country at all . "
and i forgot all about <name> for ten days while i went out to dinners and watched the social customs of the people , which are entirely different from our customs , and was introduced to men of many millions .
these persons are harmless in their earlier stages  that is to say , a man worth three or four million dollars may be a good talker , clever , amusing , and of the world ; a man with twice that amount is to be avoided , and a twenty million man is  just twenty millions .
take an instance .
i was speaking to a newspaper man about seeing the proprietor of his journal , as in my innocence i supposed newspaper men occasionally did .
my friend snorted indignantly :  " see him !
great <name> !
no .
if he happens to appear in the office , i have to associate with him ; but , thank heaven !
outside of that i move in circles where he can not come . "
and yet the first thing i have been taught to believe is that money was everything in <name> !
ii .
american politics i have been watching machinery in repose after reading about machinery in action .
an excellent gentleman , who bears a name honored in the magazine , writes , much as <unk> <unk> , of " the sublime instincts of an ancient people , " the certainty with which they can be trusted to manage their own affairs in their own way , and the speed with which they are making for all sorts of desirable goals .
this he called a statement or <unk> of american politics .
i went almost directly afterward to a saloon where gentlemen interested in <name> politics nightly congregate .
they were not pretty persons .
some of them were bloated , and they all swore cheerfully till the heavy gold <unk> on their fat stomachs rose and fell again ; but they talked over their liquor as men who had power and unquestioned access to places of trust and profit .
the magazine writer discussed theories of government ; these men the practice .
they had been there .
they knew all about it .
they banged their fists on the table and spoke of political " pulls , " the <unk> of votes , and so forth .
theirs was not the talk of village <unk> <unk> the affairs of the nation , but of strong , coarse , <unk> men fighting for spoil , and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it .
i listened long and intently to speech i could not understand  or but in spots .
it was the speech of business , however .
i had sense enough to know that , and to do my laughing outside the door .
then i began to understand why my pleasant and well-educated hosts in san <name> spoke with a bitter scorn of such duties of citizenship as voting and taking an interest in the distribution of offices .
scores of men have told me , without false pride , that they would as soon concern themselves with the public affairs of the city or state as rake muck with a <unk> .
it may be that their lofty disdain covers selfishness , but i should be very sorry habitually to meet the fat gentlemen with shiny <unk> and plump cigars in whose society i have been spending the evening .
read about politics as the cultured writer of the magazine regards 'em , and then , and not till then , pay your respects to the gentlemen who run the grimy reality .
i 'm sick of interviewing night editors who <name> their chair against the wall , and , in response to my demand for the record of a prominent citizen , answer : " well , you see , he began by keeping a saloon , " etc .
i prefer to believe that my informants are treating me as in the old sinful days in <name> i was used to treat the wandering globe-trotter .
they declare that they speak the truth , and the news of dog politics lately vouchsafed to me in <unk> inclines me to believe , but i wo n't .
the people are much too nice to <unk> as recklessly as i have been doing .
besides , i am hopelessly in love with about eight american maidens  all perfectly delightful till the next one comes into the room .
<unk> was a darling , but she lacked several things  conversation for one .
you can not live on <unk> .
she shall remain unmarried at nagasaki , while i roast a battered heart before the shrine of a big kentucky blonde , who had for a nurse when she was little a negro " mammy . "
by consequence she has welded on california beauty , <name> dresses , eastern culture , europe trips , and wild western originality , the queer , dreamy superstitions of the quarters , and the result is <unk> .
and she is but one of many stars .
item , a maiden who believes in education and possesses it , with a few hundred thousand dollars to boot and a taste for <unk> .
item , the leader of a sort of informal salon where girls congregate , read papers , and <unk> discuss metaphysical problems and <name>  a <unk> , <unk> , imperious maiden she .
item , a very small maiden , absolutely without reverence , who can in one swift sentence trample upon and leave gasping half a dozen young men .
item , a <unk> , burdened with her money , lonely , caustic , with a tongue keen as a sword , yearning for a sphere , but chained up to the rock of her vast possessions .
item , a typewriter maiden earning her own bread in this big city , because she does n't think a girl ought to be a burden on her parents , who quotes <unk> <unk> and moves through the world manfully , much respected for all her twenty inexperienced summers .
item , a woman from <unk> who has no history in the past or future , but is discreetly of the present , and strives for the confidences of male humanity on the grounds of " sympathy " ( methinks this is not altogether a new type ) .
item , a girl in a " dive , " blessed with a greek head and eyes , that seem to speak all that is best and sweetest in the world .
but woe is me !
she has no ideas in this world or the next beyond the consumption of beer ( a commission on each bottle ) , and protests that she sings the songs allotted to her nightly without more than the <unk> notion of their meaning .
sweet and comely are the maidens of devonshire ; delicate and of gracious seeming those who live in the pleasant places of london ; fascinating for all their <unk> the damsels of <name> , clinging closely to their mothers , with large eyes wondering at the wicked world ; excellent in her own place and to those who understand her is the anglo-indian " spin " in her second season ; but the girls of <name> are above and beyond them all .
they are clever , they can talk  yea , it is said that they think .
certainly they have an appearance of so doing which is delightfully deceptive .
they are original , and regard you between the brows with unabashed eyes as a sister might look at her brother .
they are instructed , too , in the folly and vanity of the male mind , for they have associated with " the boys " from <unk> , and can <unk> minister to both vices or pleasantly snub the possessor .
they possess , moreover , a life among themselves , independent of any masculine associations .
they have societies and clubs and unlimited <unk> where all the guests are girls .
they are self-possessed , without parting with any tenderness that is their <unk> ; they understand ; they can take care of themselves ; they are superbly independent .
when you ask them what makes them so charming , they say :  " it is because we are better educated than your girls , and  and we are more sensible in regard to men .
we have good times all round , but we are n't taught to regard every man as a possible husband .
nor is he expected to marry the first girl he calls on regularly . "
yes , they have good times , their freedom is large , and they do not abuse it .
they can go driving with young men and receive visits from young men to an extent that would make an english mother wink with horror , and neither driver nor <unk> has a thought beyond the enjoyment of a good time .
as certain , also , of their own poets have said :  " man is fire and woman is tow , and the devil he comes and begins to blow . "
in <name> the tow is soaked in a solution that makes it fire-proof , in absolute <name> and large knowledge ; consequently , accidents do not exceed the regular percentage arranged by the devil for each class and climate under the skies .
but the freedom of the young girl has its drawbacks .
she is  i say it with all reluctance  irreverent , from her <unk> bonnet to the buckles in her <unk> shoes .
she talks flippantly to her parents and men old enough to be her grandfather .
she has a <unk> right to the society of the man who arrives .
the parents admit it .
this is sometimes embarrassing , especially when you call on a man and his wife for the sake of information  the one being a merchant of varied knowledge , the other a woman of the world .
in five minutes your host has vanished .
in another five his wife has followed him , and you are left alone with a very charming maiden , doubtless , but certainly not the person you came to see .
she <unk> , and you grin , but you leave with the very strong impression of a wasted morning .
this has been my experience once or twice .
i have even said as pointedly as i dared to a man :  " i came to see you . "
" you 'd better see me in my office , then .
the house belongs to my women folk  to my daughter , that is to say . "
he spoke the truth .
the american of wealth is owned by his family .
they exploit him for bullion .
the women get the <unk> , the kicks are all his own .
nothing is too good for an american 's daughter ( i speak here of the <unk> classes ) .
the girls take every gift as a matter of course , and yet they develop greatly when a catastrophe arrives and the man of many millions goes up or goes down , and his daughters take to <unk> or <unk> .
i have heard many tales of heroism from the lips of girls who counted the <unk> among their friends .
the crash came , <name> , or <name> , or <name> , gave up their maid , their carriages and <name> , and with a no .
2 <unk> and a stout heart set about earning their daily bread .
" and did i drop her from the list of my friends ?
no , sir , " said a <unk> vision in white lace ; " that might happen to us any day . "
it may be this sense of possible disaster in the air that makes san <name> society go with so <unk> a rush and whirl .
recklessness is in the air .
i ca n't explain where it comes from , but there it is .
the roaring winds of the pacific make you drunk to begin with .
the aggressive luxury on all sides helps out the intoxication , and you spin forever " down the ringing grooves of change " ( there is no small change , by the way , west of the rockies ) as long as money lasts .
they make greatly and they spend lavishly ; not only the <name> , but the artisans , who pay nearly five pounds for a suit of clothes , and for other luxuries in proportion .
the young men rejoice in the days of their youth .
they gamble , yacht , race , enjoy <unk> and <unk> , the one openly , the other in secret ; they establish luxurious clubs ; they break themselves over <unk> and other things , and they are instant in a quarrel .
at twenty they are experienced in business , embark in vast enterprises , take partners as experienced as themselves , and go to pieces with as much splendor as their neighbors .
remember that the men who stocked california in the fifties were physically , and , as far as regards certain tough virtues , the pick of the earth .
the <unk> and the weakly died en route , or went under in the days of construction .
to this nucleus were added all the races of the continent  french , italian , <name> , and , of course , the jew .
the result you can see in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> women , and long , elastic , well-built boys .
it needs no little golden badge swinging from the watch-chain to <name> the native son of the golden west , the <unk> of california .
him i love because he is devoid of fear , carries himself like a man , and has a heart as big as his books .
i fancy , too , he knows how to enjoy the blessings of life that his province so abundantly <unk> upon him .
at least , i heard a little rat of a creature with <unk> shoulders explaining that a man from chicago could pull the <unk> of a californian in business .
well , if i lived in <unk> , where cherries were as big as plums , plums as big as apples , and strawberries of no account , where the procession of the fruits of the seasons was like a pageant in a <unk> <name> pantomime and the dry air was wine , i should let business slide once in a way and kick up my heels with my fellows .
the tale of the resources of california  vegetable and mineral  is a <unk> .
you can read it in books .
you would never believe me .
all manner of nourishing food , from <unk> to beef , may be bought at the lowest prices , and the people are consequently well-developed and of a high stomach .
they demand ten shillings for <unk> a jammed lock of a trunk ; they receive sixteen shillings a day for working as carpenters ; they spend many <unk> on very bad cigars , which the poorest of them smoke , and they go mad over a <unk> .
when they disagree they do so fatally , with <unk> in their hands , and on the public streets .
i was just clear of mission street when the trouble began between two gentlemen , one of whom perforated the other .
when a policeman , whose name i do not recollect , " fatally shot <name> <unk> " for attempting to escape arrest , i was in the next street .
for these things i am thankful .
it is enough to travel with a policeman in a <unk> , and , while he arranges his coat-tails as he sits down , to catch sight of a loaded revolver .
it is enough to know that fifty per cent of the men in the public saloons <name> pistols about them .
the chinaman <unk> his adversary , and methodically chops him to pieces with his hatchet .
then the press roars about the brutal ferocity of the pagan .
the italian <unk> his friend with a long knife .
the press complains of the <unk> of the alien .
the irishman and the native californian in their hours of discontent use the revolver , not once , but six times .
the press records the fact , and asks in the next column whether the world can parallel the progress of san <name> .
the american who loves his country <name> tell you that this sort of thing is confined to the lower classes .
just at present an <unk> who was sent to jail by another judge ( upon my word i can not tell whether these titles mean anything ) is breathing red-hot vengeance against his enemy .
the papers have interviewed both parties , and confidently expect a fatal issue .
now , let me draw breath and curse the negro waiter , and through him the negro in service generally .
he has been made a citizen with a vote , consequently both political parties play with him .
but that is neither here nor there .
he <name> commit in one meal every <unk> that a <unk> fresh from the <unk> is capable of , and he <name> continue to repeat those faults .
he is as complete a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> fool as any <unk> in the east ever took into her establishment .
but he is according to law a free and independent citizen  consequently above reproof or criticism .
he , and he alone , in this insane city , <name> wait at table ( the chinaman does n't count ) .
he is untrained , <unk> , but he <name> fill the place and draw the pay .
now , god and his father 's fate made him intellectually inferior to the oriental .
he insists on pretending that he serves tables by accident  as a sort of amusement .
he wishes you to understand this little fact .
you wish to eat your meals , and , if possible , to have them properly served .
he is a big , black , vain baby and a man rolled into one .
a colored gentleman who insisted on getting me pie when i wanted something else , demanded information about <name> .
i gave him some facts about wages .
" oh , hell ! "
said he , cheerfully , " that would n't keep me in cigars for a month . "
then he fawned on me for a <unk> piece .
later he took it upon himself to pity the natives of <name> .
" <unk> , " he called them  this woolly one , whose race has been the butt of every comedy on the native stage since the beginning .
and i turned and saw by the head upon his shoulders that he was a <unk> man , if there be any truth in ethnological castes .
he did his thinking in english , but he was a <unk> negro , and the race type had remained the same throughout his generations .
and the room was full of other races  some that looked exactly like <unk> ( but the trade was never recruited from that side of africa ) , some duplicates of <unk> heads , and some <unk> , if ever <unk> wore evening dress .
the american does not consider little matters of descent , though by this time he ought to know all about " damnable heredity . "
as a general rule he keeps himself very far from the negro , and says things about him that are not pretty .
there are six million negroes , more or less , in the states , and they are increasing .
the american , once having made them citizens , can not <unk> them .
he says , in his newspapers , they ought to be elevated by education .
he is trying this , but it is likely to be a long job , because black blood is much more adhesive than white , and throws back with annoying persistence .
when the negro gets religion he returns directly as a <unk> <name> to the first instincts of his people .
just now a wave of religion is sweeping over some of the southern states .
up to the present two <unk> and a <name> have appeared , and several human sacrifices have been offered up to these <unk> .
the <name> managed to get three young men , who he insisted were shadrach , <unk> , and <unk> , to walk into a blast furnace , <unk> <unk> .
they did not return .
i have seen nothing of this kind , but i have attended a negro church .
they pray , or are caused to pray by themselves in this country .
the congregation were moved by the spirit to groans and tears , and one of them danced up the aisle to the mourners ' bench .
the motive may have been genuine .
the movements of the shaken body were those of a zanzibar stick dance , such as you see at <unk> on the <unk> , and even as i watched the people , the links that bound them to the white man snapped one by one , and i saw before me the <unk> ( woolly hair ) praying to a god he did not understand .
those neatly dressed folk on the benches , and the gray-headed elder by the window , were savages , neither more nor less .
what <name> the american do with the negro ?
the south <name> not consort with him .
in some states <unk> is a penal offence .
the north is every year less and less in need of his services .
and he <name> not disappear .
he <name> continue as a problem .
his friends <name> urge that he is as good as the white man .
his enemies  well , you can guess what his enemies <name> do from a little incident that followed on a recent appointment by the president .
he made a negro an assistant in a post-office where  think of it !  he had to work at the next desk to a white girl , the daughter of a colonel , one of the first families of <name> 's modern chivalry , and all the weary , weary rest of it .
the southern chivalry howled , and hanged or burned some one in effigy .
perhaps it was the president , and perhaps it was the negro  but the principle remains the same .
they said it was an insult .
it is not good to be a negro in the land of the free and the home of the brave .
but this is nothing to do with san <name> and her <name> maidens , her strong , swaggering men , and her wealth of gold and pride .
they bore me to a banquet in honor of a brave lieutenant  <unk> , of the " <unk> "  who stuck by his ship in the great cyclone at <unk> and <unk> himself as an officer should .
on that occasion  't was at the bohemian club  i heard oratory with the <unk> of o 's , and devoured a dinner the memory of which <name> descend with me into the hungry grave .
there were about forty speeches delivered , and not one of them was average or ordinary .
it was my first introduction to the american eagle screaming for all it was worth .
the lieutenant 's heroism served as a <name> from which the <unk> ones turned themselves loose and kicked .
they ransacked the clouds of sunset , the <unk> of heaven , the deeps of hell , and the splendor of the resurrection for <unk> and metaphors , and hurled the result at the head of the guest of the evening .
never since the morning stars <name> together for <name> , i learned , had an amazed creation witnessed such superhuman bravery as that displayed by the american navy in the samoa cyclone .
till earth rotted in the phosphorescent <unk> slime of a decayed universe , that <unk> gallantry would not be forgotten .
i grieve that i can not give the exact words .
my attempt at <unk> their spirit is pale and inadequate .
i sat bewildered on a <unk> niagara of <unk> .
it was magnificent  it was stupendous  and i was conscious of a wicked <name> to hide my face in a napkin and grin .
then , according to rule , they produced their dead , and across the snowy <unk> dragged the corpse of every man slain in the civil war , and hurled defiance at " our natural enemy " ( england , so please you ) , " with her chain of fortresses across the world . "
thereafter they glorified their nation afresh from the beginning , in case any detail should have been overlooked , and that made me uncomfortable for their sakes .
how in the world can a white man , a sahib , of our blood , stand up and plaster praise on his own country ?
he can think as highly as he likes , but this open-mouthed vehemence of adoration struck me almost as indelicate .
my hosts talked for rather more than three hours , and at the end seemed ready for three hours more .
but when the lieutenant  such a big , brave , gentle giant  rose to his feet , he delivered what seemed to me as the speech of the evening .
i remember nearly the whole of it , and it ran something in this way :  " gentlemen  it 's very good of you to give me this dinner and to tell me all these <unk> , but what i want you to understand  the fact is , what we want and what we ought to get at once , is a navy  more ships  lots of 'em  " then we howled the top of the roof off , and i for one fell in love with <unk> on the spot .
<unk> !
he was a man .
the <name> among merchants bid me take no heed to the warlike sentiments of some of the old generals .
" the <unk> are thrown in for effect , " quoth he , " and whenever we get on our hind legs we always express a <name> to chaw up england .
it's a sort of family affair . "
and , indeed , when you come to think of it , there is no other country for the american public speaker to trample upon .
<name> has germany ; we have russia ; for italy austria is provided ; and the humblest pathan possesses an ancestral enemy .
only <name> stands out of the racket , and therefore to be in fashion makes a <unk> of the mother country , and hangs her when occasion requires .
" the chain of fortresses " man , a fascinating talker , explained to me after the affair that he was compelled to blow off steam .
everybody expected it .
when we had chanted " the <name> spangled banner " not more than eight times , we adjourned .
<name> is a very great country , but it is not yet heaven , with electric lights and plush fittings , as the speakers professed to believe .
my listening mind went back to the politicians in the saloon , who wasted no time in talking about freedom , but quietly made arrangements to impose their <name> on the citizens .
" the judge is a great man , but give thy presents to the clerk , " as the proverb saith .
and what more remains to tell ?
i can not write <unk> , because i am in love with all those girls aforesaid , and some others who do not appear in the <unk> .
the typewriter is an institution of which the comic papers make much capital , but she is vastly convenient .
she and a companion rent a room in a business quarter , and , aided by a <unk> machine , copy <unk> .
at the rate of six annas a <name> .
only a woman can operate a <unk> machine , because she has served apprenticeship to the sewing machine .
she can earn as much as one hundred dollars a month , and professes to regard this form of <unk> as her natural <name> .
but , oh !
how she hates it in her heart of hearts !
when i had got over the surprise of doing business with and trying to give orders to a young woman of coldly , <unk> aspect intrenched behind <unk> spectacles , i made inquiries concerning the pleasures of this independence .
they liked it  indeed they did .
't was the natural fate of almost all girls  the recognized custom in <name>  and i was a barbarian not to see it in that light .
" well , and after ? "
said i .
" what happens ? "
" we work for our bread . "
" and then what do you expect ? "
" then we shall work for our bread . "
" till you die ? "
" ye-es  unless  " " unless what ?
this is your business , you know .
a man works until he dies . "
" so shall we "  this without enthusiasm  " i suppose . "
said the partner in the firm , <unk> :  " sometimes we marry our employees  at least , that 's what the newspapers say . "
the hand banged on half a dozen of the keys of the machine at once .
" yet i do n't care .
i hate it  i hate it  i hate it  and you need n't look so ! "
the senior partner was regarding the rebel with <unk> reproach .
" i thought you did , " said i .
" i do n't suppose american girls are much different from english ones in instinct . "
" is n't it <unk> <unk> who says that the only difference between country and country lie in the slang and the uniform of the police ? "
now , in the name of all the gods at once , what is one to say to a young <name> ( who in england would be a person ) who earns her own bread , and very naturally hates the employ , and slings out-of-the-way quotations at your head ?
that one falls in love with her goes without saying , but that is not enough .
a mission should be established .
iii .
american salmon the race is neither to the swift nor the battle to the strong ; but time and chance cometh to all .
i have lived !
the american continent may now sink under the sea , for i have taken the best that it yields , and the best was neither dollars , love , nor real estate .
hear now , gentlemen of the punjab fishing club , who whip the reaches of the <unk> , and you who painfully import trout over to <unk> , and i <name> tell you how old man california and i went fishing , and you shall envy .
we returned from the <unk> to portland by the way we had come , the steamer stopping en route to pick up a night 's catch of one of the salmon wheels on the river , and to deliver it at a <unk> downstream .
when the proprietor of the wheel announced that his take was two thousand two hundred and thirty pounds weight of fish , " and not a heavy catch neither , " i thought he lied .
but he sent the boxes aboard , and i counted the salmon by the hundred  huge <unk> hardly dead , scores of twenty and thirty <unk> , and a host of smaller fish .
they were all <unk> salmon , as distinguished from the " steel head " and the " silver side . "
that is to say , they were <name> salmon , and california and i dropped a tear over them , as monarchs who deserved a better fate ; but the lust of slaughter entered into our souls , and we talked fish and forgot the mountain scenery that had so moved us a day before .
the steamer halted at a rude wooden warehouse built on piles in a lonely reach of the river , and sent in the fish .
i followed them up a <unk> , fishy incline that led to the <unk> .
the crazy building was quivering with the machinery on its floors , and a glittering bank of tin scraps twenty feet high showed where the waste was thrown after the cans had been punched .
only chinamen were employed on the work , and they looked like <unk> yellow devils as they crossed the <unk> of sunlight that lay upon the floor .
when our <unk> arrived , the rough wooden boxes broke of themselves as they were dumped down under a jet of water , and the salmon burst out in a stream of quicksilver .
a chinaman jerked up a <unk> , beheaded and detailed it with two swift strokes of a knife , flicked out its internal arrangements with a third , and case it into a <unk> tank .
the headless fish leaped from under his hands as though they were facing a rapid .
other chinamen pulled them from the vat and thrust them under a thing like a <unk> , which , descending , <unk> them into unseemly red <unk> fit for the can .
more chinamen , with yellow , crooked fingers , jammed the stuff into the cans , which slid down some marvellous machine forthwith , <unk> their own tops as they passed .
each can was hastily tested for flaws , and then sunk with a hundred companions into a vat of boiling water , there to be half cooked for a few minutes .
the cans bulged slightly after the operation , and were therefore <unk> along by the <unk> to men with needles and <unk> who <unk> them and soldered the aperture .
except for the label , the " finest columbia salmon " was ready for the market .
i was impressed not so much with the speed of the manufacture as the character of the factory .
inside , on a floor ninety by forty , the most civilized and murderous of machinery .
outside , three footsteps , the <unk> pines and the immense solitude of the hills .
our steamer only stayed twenty minutes at that place , but i counted two hundred and forty finished cans made from the catch of the previous night ere i left the slippery , blood-stained , <unk> , oily floors and the <unk> chinamen .
we reached portland , california and i crying for salmon , and a real-estate man , to whom we had been intrusted by an insurance man , met us in the street , saying that fifteen miles away , across country , we should come upon a place called <unk> , where we might perchance find what we desired .
and california , his coat-tails flying in the wind , ran to a livery-stable and chartered a wagon and team forthwith .
i could push the wagon about with one hand , so light was its structure .
the team was purely american  that is to say , almost human in its intelligence and <unk> .
some one said that the roads were not good on the way to <unk> , and warned us against smashing the springs .
" portland , " who had watched the preparations , finally reckoned " he 'd come along , too ; " and under heavenly skies we three companions of a day set forth , california carefully lashing our rods into the carriage , and the by-standers overwhelming us with directions as to the <unk> we were to pass , the <unk> we were to cross , and the <unk> we were to seek signs from .
half a mile from this city of fifty thousand souls we struck ( and this must be taken literally ) a plank road that would have been a disgrace to an <name> village .
then six miles of <unk> road showed us that the team could move .
a railway ran between us and the banks of the <unk> , and another above us through the mountains .
all the land was dotted with small <unk> , and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons , bunches of <unk> , <unk> <unk> sitting in the hay behind .
the men generally looked like loafers , but their women were all well dressed .
brown <unk> on a <unk> jacket does not , however , consort with <unk> .
then we struck into the woods along what california called a <unk> <unk>  a good road  and portland a " fair track . "
it wound in and out among <unk> stumps under <unk> , along the corners of log fences , through hollows , which must be hopeless marsh in the <name> , and up absurd <unk> .
but nowhere throughout its length did i see any evidence of <unk> .
there was a track  you could n't well get off it , and it was all you could do to stay on it .
the dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts , and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air .
the journey in itself was a delight .
sometimes we crashed through <unk> ; anon , where the blackberries grew <unk> , we found a lonely little cemetery , the wooden rails all awry and the pitiful , stumpy <unk> nodding <unk> at the soft green <unk> .
then , with oaths and the sound of rent <unk> , a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a " <unk> " road , hauling a <unk> log along a rudely made slide .
a valley full of wheat and <unk> succeeded , and halting at a house , we bought <unk> weight of <unk> black cherries for something less than a rupee , and got a drink of <unk> water for nothing , while the <unk> team <unk> sagaciously by the road-side .
once we found a <unk> camp of <unk> lounging by a pool , ready for a sale or a swap , and once two <unk> youngsters shot down a hill on indian ponies , their full <unk> banging from the <unk> saddle .
they had been fishing , and were our brethren , therefore .
we shouted aloud in chorus to scare a wild cat ; we <unk> over the reasons that had led a snake to cross a road ; we heaved bits of bark at a <unk> <unk> , who was really the little gray squirrel of <name> , and had come to call on me ; we lost our way , and got the wagon so beautifully fixed on a <unk> road that we had to tie the two hind wheels to get it down .
above all , california told tales of <name> and arizona , of lonely nights spent out prospecting , the slaughter of deer and the <name> of men , of woman  lovely woman  who is a firebrand in a western city and leads to the popping of pistols , and of the sudden changes and chances of fortune , who delights in making the miner or the <unk> a <unk> millionaire and in " <unk> " the railroad king .
that was a day to be remembered , and it had only begun when we <name> rein at a <name> farm-house on the banks of the <unk> and sought horse feed and lodging , ere we hastened to the river that broke over a weir not a quarter of a mile away .
imagine a stream seventy yards broad divided by a <unk> island , running over seductive " <unk> " and swirling into deep , quiet pools , where the good salmon goes to smoke his pipe after meals .
get such a stream amid fields of <unk> crops surrounded by hills of pines , throw in where you please quiet water , <unk> meadows , and a <unk> bluff just to keep the scenery from growing too monotonous , and you <name> get some faint notion of the <unk> .
the weir had been erected to pen the <unk> salmon from going further up-stream .
we could see them , twenty or thirty pounds , by the score in the deep pools , or flying madly against the weir and foolishly skinning their noses .
they were not our prey , for they would not rise at a fly , and we knew it .
all the same , when one made his leap against the weir , and landed on the <unk> with a jar that shook the board i was standing on , i would fain have claimed him for my own capture .
portland had no <name> .
he held the <unk> and the whiskey .
california sniffed up-stream and down-stream , across the racing water , chose his ground , and let the gaudy fly drop in the tail of a <unk> .
i was getting my <name> together , when i heard the joyous shriek of the reel and the yells of california , and three feet of living silver leaped into the air far across the water .
the forces were engaged .
the salmon tore up-stream , the tense line cutting the water like a <unk> behind him , and the light bamboo bowed to breaking .
what happened thereafter i can not tell .
california swore and prayed , and portland shouted advice , and i did all three for what appeared to be half a day , but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour , and sullenly our fish came home with spurts of temper , dashes head on and <unk> in the air , but home to the bank came he , and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch .
we landed him in a little bay , and the spring weight in his gorgeous gills checked at eleven and one half pounds .
eleven and one half pounds of fighting salmon !
we danced a <unk> on the pebbles , and california caught me round the waist in a hug that went near to breaking my ribs , while he shouted :  " partner !
partner !
this is <name> !
now you catch your fish !
twenty-four years i 've waited for this ! "
i went into that <unk> river and made my cast just above the weir , and all but <unk> a <unk> <unk> with a <name> mouth who coiled herself on a stone and hissed <unk> .
the next cast  ah , the pride of it , the regal splendor of it !
the thrill that ran down from <unk> to toe !
then the water boiled .
he broke for the fly and got it .
there remained enough sense in me to give him all he wanted when he jumped not once , but twenty times , before the up-stream flight that ran my line out to the last half-dozen turns , and i saw the <unk> <unk> glitter under the thinning green coils .
my thumb was burned deep when i strove to <unk> the line .
i did not feel it till later , for my soul was out in the dancing weir , praying for him to turn ere he took my tackle away .
and the prayer was heard .
as i bowed back , the butt of the <name> on my left <unk> and the top joint dipping like unto a weeping <name> , he turned and accepted each inch of slack that i could by any means get in as a favor from on high .
there lie several sorts of success in this world that taste well in the moment of enjoyment , but i question whether the stealthy theft of line from an able-bodied salmon who knows exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it is not sweeter than any other victory within human scope .
like california 's fish , he ran at me head on , and leaped against the line , but the lord gave me two hundred and fifty pairs of fingers in that hour .
the banks and the <unk> danced dizzily round me , but i only reeled  reeled as for life  reeled for hours , and at the end of the reeling continued to give him the butt while he <unk> in a pool .
california was further up the reach , and with the corner of my eye i could see him casting with long casts and much skill .
then he struck , and my fish broke for the weir in the same instant , and down the reach we came , california and i , reel answering reel even as the morning stars sing together .
the first wild enthusiasm of capture had died away .
we were both at work now in deadly <name> to prevent the lines <unk> , to stall off a down-stream rush for shaggy water just above the weir , and at the same time to get the fish into the shallow bay down-stream that gave the best practicable landing .
portland bid us both be of good heart , and volunteered to take the <name> from my hands .
i would rather have died among the pebbles than surrender my right to play and land a salmon , weight unknown , with an <unk> <name> .
i heard california , at my ear , it seemed , gasping : " he 's a fighter from <unk> , sure ! "
as his fish made a fresh break across the stream .
i saw portland fall off a log fence , break the overhanging bank , and clatter down to the pebbles , all sand and <unk> , and i dropped on a log to rest for a moment .
as i <name> breath the weary hands slackened their hold , and i forgot to give him the butt .
a wild <unk> in the water , a plunge , and a break for the <unk> of the <unk> was my reward , and the weary toil of reeling in with one eye under the water and the other on the top joint of the <name> was renewed .
worst of all , i was blocking california 's path to the little landing bay aforesaid , and he had to halt and tire his prize where he was .
" the father of all the salmon ! "
he shouted .
" for the love of heaven , get your trout to bank , <name> bull ! "
but i could do no more .
even the insult failed to move me .
the rest of the game was with the salmon .
he suffered himself to be drawn , <unk> with pretended delight at getting to the haven where i would fain bring him .
yet no sooner did he feel shoal water under his ponderous belly than he backed like a torpedo-boat , and the snarl of the reel told me that my labor was in vain .
a dozen times , at least , this happened ere the line hinted he had given up the battle and would be towed in .
he was towed .
the <unk> was useless for one of his size , and i would not have him <unk> .
i stepped into the shallows and heaved him out with a respectful hand under the gill , for which kindness he battered me about the legs with his tail , and i felt the strength of him and was proud .
california had taken my place in the shallows , his fish hard held .
i was up the bank lying full length on the <unk> grass and gasping in company with my first salmon caught , played and landed on an <unk> <name> .
my hands were cut and bleeding , i was dripping with sweat , spangled like a <unk> with scales , water from my waist down , nose peeled by the sun , but utterly , supremely , and <unk> happy .
the beauty , the darling , the <name> , my salmon bahadur , weighed twelve pounds , and i had been <unk> minutes bringing him to bank !
he had been lightly hooked on the <name> of the right jaw , and the hook had not wearied him .
that hour i sat among princes and crowned heads greater than them all .
below the bank we heard california scuffling with his salmon and swearing spanish oaths .
portland and i assisted at the capture , and the fish dragged the spring balance out by the roots .
it was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds .
we stretched the three fish on the grass  the eleven and a half , the twelve and fifteen <unk>  and we gave an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again .
how shall i tell the glories of that day so that you may be interested ?
again and again did california and i prance down that reach to the little bay , each with a salmon in tow , and land him in the shallows .
then portland took my <name> and caught some <unk> , and my spoon was carried away by an unknown leviathan .
each fish , for the merits of the three that had died so <unk> , was hastily hooked on the balance and flung back .
portland recorded the weight in a pocket-book , for he was a real-estate man .
each fish fought for all he was worth , and none more savagely than the smallest , a game little <unk> .
at the end of six hours we added up the list .
read it .
total : sixteen fish ; aggregate weight , one hundred and forty pounds .
the score in detail runs something like this  it is only interesting to those concerned : fifteen , eleven and a half , twelve , ten , nine and three quarters , eight , and so forth ; as i have said , nothing under six pounds , and three <unk> .
very solemnly and <unk> we put up our rods  it was <name> enough for all time  and returned weeping in each other 's arms , weeping tears of pure <name> , to that simple , <unk> family in the packing-case house by the water-side .
the old farmer recollected days and nights of fierce warfare with the indians " way back in the fifties , " when every ripple of the columbia river and her tributaries hid covert danger .
god had <unk> him with a queer , crooked gift of expression and a fierce anxiety for the welfare of his two little sons  tanned and reserved children , who attended school daily and spoke good english in a strange tongue .
his wife was an austere woman , who had once been kindly , and perhaps handsome .
very many years of toil had taken the elasticity out of step and voice .
she looked for nothing better than everlasting work  the chafing detail of housework  and then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberries and the pines .
but in her grim way she sympathized with her eldest daughter , a small and silent maiden of eighteen , who had thoughts very far from the meals she tended and the pans she scoured .
we stumbled into the household at a crisis , and there was a deal of downright humanity in that same .
a bad , wicked <unk> had promised the maiden a dress in time for a to-morrow 's <unk> journey , and though the barefooted <unk> , who stood in very wholesome awe of his sister , had scoured the woods on a pony in search , that dress never arrived .
so , with sorrow in her heart and a hundred <unk> glances up the road , she waited upon the strangers and , i doubt not , cursed them for the wants that stood between her and her need for tears .
it was a genuine little tragedy .
the mother , in a heavy , passionless voice , rebuked her impatience , yet sat up far into the night , bowed over a heap of sewing for the daughter 's benefit .
these things i beheld in the long <unk> twilight and whispering night , loafing round the little house with california , who <unk> himself like a lotus to the moon , or in the little boarded bunk that was our bedroom , <unk> tales with portland and the old man .
most of the yarns began in this way :  " red <name> was a <unk> back of lone county , montana , " or " there was a man riding the trail met a <unk> sitting in a cactus , " or " 'bout the time of the san <name> land boom , a woman from <unk> , " etc .
you can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of stories they were .
iv .
the yellowstone once upon a time there was a <name> who brought his team and a friend into the yellowstone park without due thought .
presently they came upon a few of the natural beauties of the place , and that <name> turned his team into his friend 's team , howling :  " get out o ' this , <name> .
all <unk> alight under our noses ! "
and they called the place hell 's <unk> to this day to witness if the <name> lied .
we , too , the old <name> from chicago , her husband , <name> , and the good little mares , came to hell 's <unk> , which is about sixty acres in extent , and when <name> said :  " would you like to drive over it ? "
we said :  " certainly not , and if you do we shall report you to the park authorities . "
there was a plain , blistered , peeled , and abominable , and it was given over to the <unk> and <unk> of devils who threw mud , and steam , and dirt at each other with <unk> , and <unk> , and bellowing curses .
the places smelled of the refuse of the pit , and that odor mixed with the clean , wholesome aroma of the pines in our nostrils throughout the day .
this yellowstone park is laid out like <unk> , in exercises of progressive difficulty .
hell 's <unk> was a prelude to ten or twelve miles of geyser formation .
we passed hot streams boiling in the forest ; saw whiffs of steam beyond these , and yet other whiffs breaking through the <name> green hills in the far distance ; we trampled on sulphur in crystals , and sniffed things much worse than any sulphur which is known to the upper world ; and so journeying , bewildered with the novelty , came upon a really <unk> place where <name> suggested we should get out and play with the geysers on foot .
imagine mighty green fields <unk> with <unk> , all the flowers of the summer growing up to the very edge of the lime .
that was our first glimpse of the geyser basins .
the buggy had pulled up close to a rough , broken , blistered cone of <unk> stuff between ten and twenty feet high .
there was trouble in that place  moaning , splashing , gurgling , and the clank of machinery .
a spurt of boiling water jumped into the air , and a wash of water followed .
i removed swiftly .
the old <name> from chicago shrieked .
" what a wicked waste ! "
said her husband .
i think they call it the riverside geyser .
its spout was torn and ragged like the mouth of a gun when a shell has burst there .
it grumbled madly for a moment or two , and then was still .
i crept over the steaming lime  it was the burning marl on which satan lay  and looked fearfully down its mouth .
you should never look a gift geyser in the mouth .
i beheld a horrible , slippery , slimy funnel with water rising and falling ten feet at a time .
then the water rose to lip level with a rush , and an infernal bubbling troubled this devil 's <unk> before the sullen heave of the crest of a wave lapped over the edge and made me run .
<name> the nature of the human soul !
i had begun with awe , not to say terror , for this was my first experience of such things .
i stepped back from the banks of the riverside geyser , saying :  " pooh !
is that all it can do ? "
yet for aught i knew , the whole thing might have blown up at a <unk> notice , she , he , or it being an arrangement of uncertain temper .
we drifted on , up that miraculous valley .
on either side of us were hills from a thousand or fifteen hundred feet high , wooded from crest to heel .
as far as the eye could range forward were columns of steam in the air , <unk> lumps of lime , <unk> <unk> monsters , still pools of <unk> stretches of blue <unk> , a river that coiled on itself twenty times , pointed <unk> of strange colors , and ridges of glaring , staring white .
a <unk> trooper of <name> extraction  never was park so carefully <unk>  came up to inform us that as yet we had not seen any of the real geysers ; that they were all a mile or so up the valley , and tastefully scattered round the hotel in which we would rest for the night .
<name> is a free country , but the citizens look down on the soldier .
i had to entertain that trooper .
the old <name> from chicago would have none of him ; so we loafed alone together , now across <unk> pine logs sunk in swampy ground , anon over the ringing geyser formation , then pounding through <unk> or brushing knee-deep through long grass .
" and why did you enlist ? "
said i .
the <unk> one 's face began to work .
i thought he would have a fit , but he told me a story instead  such a nice tale of a naughty little girl who wrote pretty love letters to two men at once .
she was a simple village wife , but a wicked " family <unk> " countess could n't have accomplished her ends better .
she drove one man nearly wild with the pretty little treachery , and the other man abandoned her and came west to forget the <unk> .
<unk> was that man .
we rounded and limped over a low spur of hill , and came out upon a field of aching , snowy lime rolled in sheets , twisted into knots , riven with rents , and diamonds , and stars , stretching for more than half a mile in every direction .
on this place of despair lay most of the big , bad geysers who know when there is trouble in <unk> , who tell the pines when there is a cyclone on the atlantic seaboard , and who are exhibited to visitors under pretty and fanciful names .
the first mound that i encountered belonged to a goblin who was splashing in his tub .
i heard him kick , pull a <unk> on his shoulders , gasp , crack his joints , and rub himself down with a towel ; then he let the water out of the bath , as a thoughtful man should , and it all sunk down out of sight till another goblin arrived .
so we looked and we wondered at the <unk> , whose mouth is built up exactly like a hive , at the turban ( which is not in the least like a turban ) , and at many , many other geysers , hot holes , and springs .
some of them rumbled , some hissed , some went off <unk> , and others lay dead still in sheets of sapphire and <name> .
would you believe that even these terrible creatures have to be guarded by the troopers to prevent the irreverent americans from <unk> the cones to pieces , or , worse still , making the geyser sick ?
if you take a small barrel full of <unk> and drop it down a geyser 's mouth , that geyser <name> presently be forced to lay all before you , and for days afterward <name> be of an irritated and inconstant stomach .
when they told me the tale i was filled with sympathy .
now i wish that i had <unk> and tried the experiment on some lonely little beast far away in the woods .
it sounds so probable and so human .
yet he would be a bold man who would administer <unk> to the <unk> .
she is <unk> , having no mouth ; she looks like a pool , fifty feet long and thirty wide , and there is no ornamentation about her .
at irregular intervals she speaks and sends up a volume of water over two hundred feet high to begin with , then she is angry for a day and a half  sometimes for two days .
owing to her peculiarity of going mad in the night , not many people have seen the <unk> at her finest ; but the clamor of her unrest , men say , shakes the wooden hotel , and echoes like thunder among the hills .
the congregation returned to the hotel to put down their impressions in diaries and <unk> , which they wrote up ostentatiously in the verandas .
it was a sweltering hot day , albeit we stood <unk> higher than the level of simla , and i left that raw pine creaking <unk> for the cool shade of a clump of pines between whose trunks glimmered tents .
a batch of united states troopers came down the road and flung themselves across the country into their rough lines .
the mexican cavalryman can ride , though he keeps his accoutrements <unk> and his horse <unk> .
i was free of that camp in five minutes  free to play with the heavy , <unk> carbines , have the saddles stripped , and punch the horses knowingly in the ribs .
one of the men had been in the fight with " <unk> , " and he told me how that great chief , his <unk> tail tied up in red calico , swaggered in front of the united states cavalry , challenging all to single combat .
but he was slain , and a few of his tribe with him .
" there 's no use in an indian , anyway , " concluded my friend .
a couple of <unk>  real <unk>  jingled through the camp amid a shower of mild chaff .
they were on their way to cook city , i fancy , and i know that they never washed .
but they were picturesque ruffians exceedingly , with long spurs , hooded stirrups , slouch hats , fur <unk> over their knees , and <unk> just easy to hand .
" the <unk> 's goin ' under before long , " said my friend .
" soon as the country 's settled up he 'll have to go .
but he 's mighty useful now .
what would we do without the <unk> ? "
" as how ? "
said i , and the camp laughed .
" he has the money .
we have the skill .
he comes in <name> to play poker at the military posts .
we play poker  a few .
when he 's lost his money we make him drunk and let him go .
sometimes we get the wrong man . "
and he told me a tale of an innocent <unk> who turned up , cleaned out , at an army post , and played poker for thirty-six hours .
but it was the post that was cleaned out when that long-haired caucasian removed himself , heavy with everybody 's pay and declining the proffered liquor .
" <unk> , " said the historian , " i do n't play with no <unk> unless he 's a little bit drunk first . "
ere i departed i gathered from more than one man the significant fact that up to one hundred yards he felt absolutely secure behind his revolver .
" in england , i understand , " quoth the limber youth from the south ,  " in england a man is n't allowed to play with no <unk> .
he 's got to be taught all that when he <unk> .
i did n't want much teaching how to shoot straight 'fore i served uncle <name> .
and that 's just where it is .
but you was talking about your horse guards now ? "
i explained briefly some peculiarities of equipment connected with our <unk> crack cavalry .
i grieve to say the camp roared .
" take 'em over swampy ground .
let 'em run around a bit an ' work the starch out of 'em , an ' then , almighty , if we would n't plug 'em at ease i 'd eat their horses . "
there was a maiden  a very little maiden  who had just stepped out of one of <name> 's novels .
she owned a delightful mother and an equally delightful father  a <unk> , <unk> man of finance .
the parents thought that their daughter wanted change .
she lived in new hampshire .
accordingly , she had dragged them up to alaska and to the <unk> valley , and was now returning leisurely , via the yellowstone , just in time for the <unk> of the summer season at <unk> .
we had met once or twice before in the park , and i had been amazed and amused at her critical commendation of the wonders that she saw .
from that very resolute little mouth i received a lecture on american literature , the nature and <unk> of washington society , the precise value of cable 's works as compared with uncle remus <name> , and a few other things that had nothing whatever to do with geysers , but were altogether pleasant .
now , an english maiden who had stumbled on a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> wanderer come from and going to goodness knows where , would , her mother <unk> her and her father brandishing an umbrella , have regarded him as a dissolute adventurer  a person to be disregarded .
not so those delightful people from new hampshire .
they were good enough to treat him  it sounds almost incredible  as a human being , possibly respectable , probably not in immediate need of financial assistance .
papa talked pleasantly and to the point .
the little maiden strove valiantly with the accent of her birth and that of her rearing , and mamma smiled <unk> in the background .
balance this with a story of a young english idiot i met <unk> about inside his high collar , attended by a valet .
he condescended to tell me that " you ca n't be too careful who you talk to in these parts . "
and stalked on , fearing , i suppose , every minute for his social <name> .
that man was a barbarian ( i took occasion to tell him so ) , for he <unk> himself after the manner of the <unk> and hunted of <unk> who are at perpetual feud one with another .
you <name> understand that these foolish stories are introduced in order to cover the fact that this pen can not describe the glories of the upper geyser basin .
the evening i spent under the <name> of the castle geyser , sitting on a log with some troopers and watching a <unk> keep forty feet high spouting hot water .
if the castle went off first , they said the <unk> would be quiet , and vice <unk> , and then they told tales till the moon got up and a party of campers in the woods gave us all something to eat .
then came soft , <unk> forest that <unk> the wheels , and two troopers on detachment duty stole noiselessly behind us .
one was the <unk> man , and they talked merrily while the <unk> horses <unk> about among the trees .
and so a cavalry escort was with us for a mile , till we got to a mighty hill strewn with moss <unk> , and everybody had to jump out and pant in that thin air .
but how intoxicating it was !
the old <name> from chicago ducked like an emancipated hen as she scuttled about the road , <unk> pieces of rock into her <unk> .
she sent me fifty yards down to the hill-side to pick up a piece of broken bottle which she insisted was moss agate .
" i 've some o ' that at home , an ' they shine .
yes , you go get it , young man . "
as we climbed the long path the road grew <unk> and <unk> till it became , without disguise , the bed of a torrent ; and just when things were at their <unk> we nearly fell into a little sapphire lake  but never sapphire was so blue  called <name> 's lake ; and that between eight and nine thousand feet above the sea .
afterward , grass downs , all on a vehement slope , so that the buggy , following the <unk> road , ran on the two <unk> mostly till we dipped <unk> into a ford , climbed up a <name> , raced along down , dipped again , and pulled up dishevelled at " <name> 's " for lunch and an hour 's rest .
then we lay on the grass and laughed with sheer bliss of being alive .
this have i known once in japan , once on the banks of the columbia , what time the salmon came in and california howled , and once again in the yellowstone by the light of the eyes of the maiden from new hampshire .
four little pools lay at my elbow , one was of black water ( tepid ) , one clear water ( cold ) , one clear water ( hot ) , one red water ( boiling ) .
my newly washed handkerchief covered them all , and we two marvelled as children <name> .
" this evening we shall do the grand canyon of the yellowstone , " said the maiden .
" together ? "
said i ; and she said , " yes . "
the sun was beginning to sink when we heard the roar of falling waters and came to a broad river along whose banks we ran .
and then  i might at a pinch describe the infernal regions , but not the other place .
the yellowstone river has occasion to run through a gorge about eight miles long .
to get to the bottom of the gorge it makes two leaps , one of about one hundred and twenty and the other of three hundred feet .
i investigated the upper or lesser fall , which is close to the hotel .
up to that time nothing particular happens to the yellowstone  its banks being only <name> , rather steep , and <unk> adorned with pines .
at the falls it comes round a corner , green , solid , ribbed with a little foam , and not more than thirty yards wide .
then it goes over , still green , and rather more solid than before .
after a minute or two , you , sitting upon a rock directly above the drop , begin to understand that something has occurred ; that the river has jumped between solid <name> walls , and that the gentle froth of water lapping the sides of the gorge below is really the outcome of great waves .
and the river yells aloud ; but the cliffs do not allow the yells to escape .
that inspection began with curiosity and finished in terror , for it seemed that the whole world was sliding in <unk> from under my feet .
i followed with the others round the corner to arrive at the brink of the canyon .
we had to climb up a nearly perpendicular ascent to begin with , for the ground rises more than the river drops .
stately pine woods fringe either lip of the gorge , which is the gorge of the yellowstone .
you 'll find all about it in the guide books .
all that i can say is that without warning or preparation i looked into a gulf seventeen hundred feet deep , with eagles and <unk> circling far below .
and the sides of that gulf were one wild <unk> of color  crimson , <name> , cobalt , <unk> , <name> , <name> splashed with port wine , snow white , vermilion , lemon , and silver gray in wide washes .
the sides did not fall sheer , but were graven by time , and water , and air into monstrous heads of kings , dead chiefs  men and women of the old time .
so far below that no sound of its strife could reach us , the yellowstone river ran a <unk> strip of <name> green .
the sunlight took those wondrous walls and gave fresh hues to those that nature had already laid there .
evening crept through the pines that shadowed us , but the full <name> of the day flamed in that canyon as we went out very cautiously to a jutting piece of rock  blood-red or pink it was  that overhung the deepest deeps of all .
now i know what it is to sit <unk> amid the clouds of sunset as the spirits sit in <name> 's pictures .
<unk> took away all sensation of touch or form , but the sense of blinding color remained .
when i reached the mainland again i had sworn that i had been floating .
the maid from new hampshire said no word for a very long time .
then she quoted poetry , which was perhaps the best thing she could have done .
" and to think that this <unk> has been going on all these days an' none of we ever saw it , " said the old <name> from chicago , with an acid glance at her husband .
" no , only the <unk> , " said he , unmoved ; and the maiden and i laughed .
inspiration is fleeting , beauty is vain , and the power of the mind for wonder limited .
though the shining hosts themselves had risen <unk> from the bottom of the gorge , they would not have prevented her papa and one baser than he from rolling stones down those stupendous <unk> slides .
seventeen hundred feet of <unk> pitch and rather more than seventeen hundred colors for log or <unk> to whirl through !
so we heaved things and saw them gather way and bound from white rock to red or yellow , dragging behind them torrents of color , till the noise of their descent ceased and they bounded a hundred yards clear at the last into the yellowstone .
" i 've been down there , " said <name> , that evening .
" it 's easy to get down if you 're careful  just sit an ' slide ; but getting up is worse .
an' i found down below there two stones just marked with a picture of the canyon .
i would n't sell these rocks not for fifteen dollars . "
and papa and i crawled down to the yellowstone  just above the first little fall  to wet a line for good luck .
the round moon came up and turned the cliffs and pines into silver ; and a <unk> trout came up also , and we slew him among the rocks , nearly tumbling into that wild river .
.
.
.
.
.
.
then out and away to livingstone once more .
the maiden from new hampshire disappeared , papa and mamma with her .
disappeared , too , the old <name> from chicago , and the others .
v. chicago " i know thy cunning and thy greed , thy hard high lust and wilful deed , and all thy <name> loves to tell of <unk> gifts material . "
i have struck a city  a real city  and they call it chicago .
the other places do not count .
san <name> was a <unk> as well as a city , and salt lake was a phenomenon .
this place is the first american city i have encountered .
it holds rather more than a million of people with bodies , and stands on the same sort of soil as calcutta .
having seen it , i urgently <name> never to see it again .
it is inhabited by savages .
its water is the water of the <unk> , and its air is dirt .
also it says that it is the " boss " town of <name> .
i do not believe that it has anything to do with this country .
they told me to go to the <name> house , which is overmuch gilded and <unk> , and there i found a huge hall of <unk> marble crammed with people talking about money , and spitting about everywhere .
other barbarians charged in and out of this inferno with letters and telegrams in their hands , and yet others shouted at each other .
a man who had drunk quite as much as was good for him told me that this was " the finest hotel in the finest city on god almighty 's earth . "
by the way , when an american wishes to indicate the next country or state , he says , " god <unk> earth . "
this prevents discussion and <unk> his vanity .
then i went out into the streets , which are long and flat and without end .
and verily it is not a good thing to live in the east for any length of time .
your ideas grow to clash with those held by every <unk> man .
i looked down interminable vistas flanked with nine , ten , and <unk> houses , and crowded with men and women , and the show impressed me with a great horror .
except in london  and i have forgotten what london was like  i had never seen so many white people together , and never such a collection of <unk> .
there was no color in the street and no beauty  only a maze of wire ropes overhead and dirty stone <unk> under foot .
a <unk> volunteered to show me the <name> of the town for so much an hour , and with him i wandered far .
he conceived that all this turmoil and <unk> was a thing to be reverently admired , that it was good to huddle men together in fifteen layers , one atop of the other , and to dig holes in the ground for offices .
he said that chicago was a live town , and that all the creatures hurrying by me were engaged in business .
that is to say they were trying to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their bellies .
he took me to canals as black as ink , and filled with <unk> <unk> , and bid me watch the stream of traffic across the bridges .
he then took me into a saloon , and while i drank made me note that the floor was covered with coins sunk in cement .
a hottentot would not have been guilty of this sort of barbarism .
the coins made an effect pretty enough , but the man who put them there had no thought of beauty , and , therefore , he was a savage .
then my <unk> showed me business blocks <name> with signs and studded with fantastic and absurd advertisements of goods , and looking down the long street so adorned , it was as though each <unk> stood at his door howling :  " for the sake of my money , employ or buy of me , and me only ! "
have you ever seen a crowd at a <unk> distribution ?
you know then how the men leap into the air , stretching out their arms above the crowd in the <name> of being seen , while the women <unk> slap the stomachs of their children and whimper .
i had sooner watch famine relief than the white man engaged in what he calls legitimate competition .
the one i understand .
the other makes me ill. and the cabman said that these things were the proof of progress , and by that i knew he had been reading his newspaper , as every intelligent american should .
the papers tell their <unk> in language fitted to their comprehension that the snarling together of <unk> , the heaving up of houses , and the making of money is progress .
i spent ten hours in that huge wilderness , wandering through scores of miles of these terrible streets and jostling some few hundred thousand of these terrible people who talked <unk> bat through their noses .
the cabman left me ; but after awhile i picked up another man , who was full of figures , and into my ears he poured them as occasion required or the big blank factories suggested .
here they turned out so many hundred thousand dollars ' worth of such and such an article ; there so many million other things ; this house was worth so many million dollars ; that one so many million , more or less .
it was like listening to a child babbling of its hoard of shells .
it was like watching a fool playing with buttons .
but i was expected to do more than listen or watch .
he demanded that i should admire ; and the utmost that i could say was :  " are these things so ?
then i am very sorry for you . "
that made him angry , and he said that insular envy made me <unk> .
so , you see , i could not make him understand .
about four and a half hours after <name> was turned out of the garden of <name> he felt hungry , and so , bidding <name> take care that her head was not broken by the descending fruit , <unk> up a <unk> .
that hurt his legs , cut his breast , and made him breathe heavily , and <name> was tormented with fear lest her lord should miss his footing , and so bring the tragedy of this world to an end ere the curtain had fairly risen .
had i met <name> then , i should have been sorry for him .
to-day i find eleven hundred thousand of his sons just as far advanced as their father in the <name> of getting food , and immeasurably inferior to him in that they think that their palm-trees lead straight to the skies .
consequently , i am sorry in rather more than a million different ways .
in the east bread comes naturally , even to the poorest , by a little scratching or the gift of a friend not quite so poor .
in less favored countries one is apt to forget .
then i went to bed .
and that was on a saturday night .
<name> brought me the queerest experiences of all  a revelation of barbarism complete .
i found a place that was officially described as a church .
it was a circus really , but that the worshippers did not know .
there were flowers all about the building , which was fitted up with plush and stained oak and much luxury , including twisted brass candlesticks of severest gothic design .
to these things and a congregation of savages entered suddenly a wonderful man , completely in the confidence of their god , whom he treated <unk> and exploited very much as a newspaper reporter would exploit a foreign potentate .
but , unlike the newspaper reporter , he never allowed his listeners to forget that he , and not he , was the centre of attraction .
with a voice of silver and with imagery borrowed from the <unk> , he built up for his hearers a heaven on the lines of the <name> house ( but with all the gilding real gold , and all the plate-glass <name> ) , and set in the centre of it a <unk> , <unk> , very shrewd creation that he called god .
one sentence at this point caught my delighted ear .
it was apropos of some question of the judgment , and ran :  " no !
i tell you god does n't do business that way . "
he was giving them a deity whom they could comprehend , and a gold and jewelled heaven in which they could take a natural interest .
he <unk> his performance with the slang of the streets , the counter , and the exchange , and he said that religion ought to enter into daily life .
consequently , i presume he introduced it as daily life  his own and the life of his friends .
then i escaped before the blessing , desiring no benediction at such hands .
but the persons who listened seemed to enjoy themselves , and i understood that i had met with a popular preacher .
later on , when i had perused the sermons of a gentleman called <unk> and some others , i perceived that i had been listening to a very mild specimen .
yet that man , with his brutal gold and silver idols , his <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> style of dealing with the sacred vessels , would count himself , spiritually , quite competent to send a mission to convert the indians .
all that <name> i listened to people who said that the mere fact of <unk> down strips of iron to wood , and getting a steam and iron thing to run along them was progress , that the telephone was progress , and the net-work of wires overhead was progress .
they repeated their statements again and again .
one of them took me to their city hall and board of trade works , and pointed it out with pride .
it was very ugly , but very big , and the streets in front of it were narrow and unclean .
when i saw the faces of the men who did business in that building , i felt that there had been a mistake in their <unk> .
by the way , 't is a consolation to feel that i am not writing to an english audience .
then i should have to fall into feigned ecstasies over the marvellous progress of chicago since the days of the great fire , to allude casually to the raising of the entire city so many feet above the level of the lake which it faces , and generally to <unk> before the golden calf .
but you , who are desperately poor , and therefore by these standards of no <unk> , know things , <name> understand when i write that they have managed to get a million of men together on flat land , and that the bulk of these men together appear to be lower than <unk> and not so companionable as a punjabi jat after harvest .
but i do n't think it was the blind hurry of the people , their argot , and their grand ignorance of things beyond their immediate interests that displeased me so much as a study of the daily papers of chicago .
<unk> , there was some sort of a dispute between new york and chicago as to which town should give an exhibition of products to be hereafter holden , and through the medium of their more dignified journals the two cities were <unk> and <unk> at each other like opposition newsboys .
they called it humor , but it sounded like something quite different .
that was only the first trouble .
the second lay in the tone of the productions .
leading articles which include gems such as " back of such and such a place , " or , " we noticed , tuesday , such an event , " or , " do n't " for " does not , " are things to be accepted with thankfulness .
all that made me want to cry was that in these papers were faithfully reproduced all the <unk> and " <unk> " of the <name> house bar , the slang of the <unk> , the mental elevation and integrity of the pullman car <name> , the dignity of the dime museum , and the accuracy of the excited <unk> .
i am sternly forbidden to believe that the paper <unk> the public .
then i am compelled to believe that the public educate the paper ; yet <unk> on the press are rare .
just when the sense of unreality and oppression was strongest upon me , and when i most wanted help , a man sat at my side and began to talk what he called politics .
i had chanced to pay about six shillings for a <unk> worth <unk> , and he made of the fact a text for a sermon .
he said that this was a <name> country , and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent , on the value of a thing .
they could afford it .
he said that the government imposed a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on <unk> articles , and that the american manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum .
thus an imported hat would , with duty , cost two guineas .
the american manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shillings , and sell it for one pound fifteen .
in these things , he said , lay the greatness of <name> and the <unk> of england .
competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits , but i was never to forget that this people were a <name> people , not like the pauper <unk> , and that they enjoyed paying duties .
to my weak intellect this seemed rather like <unk> with counters .
everything that i have yet purchased costs about twice as much as it would in england , and when native made is of inferior quality .
moreover , since these lines were first thought of , i have visited a gentleman who owned a factory which used to produce things .
he owned the factory still .
not a man was in it , but he was drawing a handsome income from a syndicate of firms for keeping it closed , in order that it might not produce things .
this man said that if protection were abandoned , a tide of pauper labor would flood the country , and as i looked at his factory i thought how entirely better it was to have no labor of any kind whatever rather than face so horrible a future .
meantime , do you remember that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received ?
i am an alien , and for the life of me i can not see why six shillings should be paid for <unk> caps , or eight shillings for <unk> <unk> .
when the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens <name> be smitten with the same sort of blindness .
but my friend 's assertion somehow thoroughly suited the grotesque ferocity of chicago .
see now and judge !
in the village of isser jang , on the road to montgomery , there be four <unk> women who <unk> corn  some seventy bushels a year .
beyond their hut lives purun dass , the money-lender , who on good security lends as much as five thousand rupees in a year .
<unk> singh , the smith , <unk> the village <unk>  some thirty , broken at the share , in three hundred and sixty-five days ; and <unk> <unk> , who is letter-writer and head of the little club under the travellers ' tree , generally keeps the village posted in such gossip as the barber and the <unk> have not yet made public property .
chicago husks and <unk> her wheat by the million bushels , a hundred banks lend hundreds of millions of dollars in the year , and scores of factories turn out <unk> and machinery by steam .
scores of daily papers do work which <unk> <unk> and the barber and the <unk> perform , with due regard for public opinion , in the village of isser jang .
so far as <unk> go , the difference between chicago on the lake , and isser jang on the montgomery road , is one of degree only , and not of kind .
as far as the understanding of the uses of life goes , isser jang , for all its seasonal <unk> , has the advantage over chicago .
<unk> singh knows and takes care to avoid the three or four <unk> fields on the outskirts of the village ; but he is not urged by millions of devils to run about all day in the sun and swear that his <unk> are the best in the punjab ; nor does purun dass fly forth in an ekka more than once or twice a year , and he knows , on a pinch , how to use the railway and the telegraph as well as any son of <name> in chicago .
but this is absurd .
the east is not the west , and these men must continue to deal with the machinery of life , and to call it progress .
their very preachers dare not rebuke them .
they gloss over the hunting for money and the <unk> bitterness of <name> 's curse , by saying that such things dower a man with a larger range of thoughts and higher aspirations .
they do not say , " free yourselves from your own slavery , " but rather , " if you can possibly manage it , do not set quite so much store on the things of this world . "
and they do not know what the things of this world are !
i went off to see cattle killed , by way of clearing my head , which , as you <name> perceive , was getting muddled .
they say every englishman goes to the chicago <unk> .
you shall find them about six miles from the city ; and once having seen them , you <name> never forget the sight .
as far as the eye can reach stretches a <unk> of <unk> , cunningly divided into blocks , so that the animals of any pen can be speedily driven out close to an inclined timber path which leads to an elevated covered way <unk> high above the pens .
these <unk> are two-storied .
on the upper story tramp the doomed cattle , stolidly for the most part .
on the lower , with a scuffling of sharp hoofs and multitudinous yells , run the pigs , the same end being appointed for each .
thus you <name> see the gangs of cattle waiting their turn  as they wait sometimes for days ; and they need not be distressed by the sight of their fellows running about in the fear of death .
all they know is that a man on horseback causes their <unk> neighbors to move by means of a whip .
certain bars and fences are <unk> , and behold !
that crowd have gone up the mouth of a sloping tunnel and return no more .
it is different with the pigs .
they shriek back the news of the exodus to their friends , and a hundred pens <unk> responsive .
it was to the pigs i first addressed myself .
selecting a <unk> which was full of them , as i could hear , though i could not see , i marked a sombre building <unk> it ran , and went there , not <unk> by stray cattle who had managed to escape from their proper quarters .
a pleasant smell of brine warned me of what was coming .
i entered the factory and found it full of pork in barrels , and on another story more pork <unk> , and in a huge room the halves of swine , for whose <unk> great lumps of ice were being pitched in at the window .
that room was the <unk> chamber where the pigs lay for a little while in state ere they began their progress through such passages as kings may sometimes travel .
turning a corner , and not noting an overhead arrangement of greased rail , wheel , and <unk> , i ran into the arms of four <unk> carcasses , all pure white and of a human aspect , pushed by a man clad in vehement red .
when i leaped aside , the floor was slippery under me .
also there was a flavor of <unk> in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears .
but there was no <name> in that shouting .
twelve men stood in two lines six a side .
between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly <unk> me through the window .
each man carried a knife , the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows , and from bosom to heel he was blood-red .
beyond this perspective was a column of steam , and beyond that was where i worked my <unk> way , unwilling to touch beam or wall .
the atmosphere was stifling as a night in the rains by reason of the steam and the crowd .
i climbed to the beginning of things and , perched upon a narrow beam , overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in wisconsin .
they had just been shot out of the mouth of the <unk> and huddled together in a large pen .
thence they were flicked <unk> , a few at a time , into a smaller chamber , and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs , so that they rose in the air , suspended from the railway of death .
oh !
it was then they shrieked and called on their mothers , and made promises of amendment , till the <unk> <unk> them in their backs and they slid head down into a <unk> passage , very like a big kitchen sink , that was blood-red .
there awaited them a red man with a knife , which he passed <unk> through their throats , and the <unk> shriek became a splutter , and then a fall as of heavy tropical rain , and the red man , who was backed against the <unk> , you <name> understand , stood clear of the wildly kicking hoofs and passed his hand over his eyes , not from any feeling of compassion , but because the <unk> blood was in his eyes , and he had barely time to stick the next arrival .
then that first stuck swine dropped , still kicking , into a great vat of boiling water , and spoke no more words , but <unk> in obedience to some unseen machinery , and presently came forth at the lower end of the vat , and was heaved on the blades of a blunt <unk> , things which said " hough , hough , hough ! "
and <unk> all the hair off him , except what little a couple of men with knives could remove .
then he was again hitched by the heels to that said railway , and passed down the line of the twelve men , each man with a knife  losing with each man a certain amount of his individuality , which was taken away in a <unk> , and when he reached the last man he was very beautiful to behold , but excessively <unk> and limp .
preponderance of individuality was ever a bar to foreign travel .
that pig could have been in case to visit you in <name> had he not parted with some of his most cherished notions .
the <unk> part impressed me not so much as the slaying .
they were so excessively alive , these pigs .
and then , they were so excessively dead , and the man in the dripping , clammy , not passage did not seem to care , and ere the blood of such a one had ceased to foam on the floor , such another and four friends with him had shrieked and died .
but a pig is only the unclean animal  the forbidden of the prophet .
<name> .
the american army i should very much like to deliver a <unk> on the american army and the possibilities of its extension .
you see , it is such a beautiful little army , and the dear people do n't quite understand what to do with it .
the theory is that it is an <unk> nucleus round which the militia of the country <name> rally , and from which they <name> get a stiffening in time of danger .
yet other people consider that the army should be built , like a pair of lazy tongs  on the principle of elasticity and extension  so that in time of need it may fill up its skeleton battalions and empty saddle troops .
this is real wisdom , <unk> the american army , as at present constituted , is made up of :  twenty-five regiments infantry , ten companies each .
ten regiments cavalry , twelve companies each .
five regiments artillery , twelve companies each .
now there is a notion in the air to <unk> the service on these lines :  eighteen regiments infantry at four battalions , four companies each ; third battalion , skeleton ; fourth on paper .
eight regiments cavalry at four battalions , four troops each ; third battalion , skeleton ; fourth on paper .
five regiments artillery at four battalions , four companies each ; third battalion , skeleton ; fourth on paper .
observe the beauty of this business .
the third battalion <name> have its officers , but no men ; the fourth <name> probably have a rendezvous and some equipment .
it is not contemplated to give it anything more definite at present .
assuming the regiments to be made up to full complement , we get an army of fifty thousand men , which after the need passes away must be cut down fifty per cent , to the huge delight of the officers .
the military needs of the states be three : ( a ) frontier warfare , an employment well within the grip of the present army of twenty-five thousand , and in the nature of things growing less arduous year by year ; ( b ) internal riots and commotions which rise up like a dust devil , whirl furiously , and die out long before the authorities at washington could begin to fill up even the third skeleton battalions , much less hunt about for material for the fourth ; ( c ) civil war , in which , as the case in the affair of the north and south , the regular army would be swamped in the mass of militia and armed volunteers would turn the land into a hell .
yet the authorities persist in regarding an external war as a thing to be seriously considered .
the power that would <unk> troops on american soil would be capable of heaving a <unk> of mud into the atlantic in the <name> of filling it up .
consequently , the authorities are fascinated with the idea of the sliding scale or <unk> army .
this is an hereditary instinct , for you know that when we english have got together two companies , one machine gun , a sick bullock , forty generals , and a mass of w. o. forms , we say we possess " an army corps capable of indefinite extension . "
the american army is a beautiful little army .
some day , when all the indians are happily dead or drunk , it ought to make the finest scientific and survey corps that the world has ever seen ; it does excellent work now , but there is this defect in its nature : it is officered , as you know , from west point .
the mischief of it is that west point seems to be created for the purpose of spreading a general knowledge of military matters among the people .
a boy goes up to that institution , gets his pass , and returns to civil life , so they tell me , with a dangerous knowledge that he is a suckling <name> <unk> , and may apply his learning when occasion offers .
given trouble , that man <name> be a nuisance , because he is a hideously versatile american , to begin with , as <unk> of himself as a man can be , and with all the racial disregard for human life to back him , through any <unk> generalship .
in a country where , as the records of the daily papers show , men engaged in a conflict with police or jails are all too ready to adopt a military formation and get heavily shot in a sort of cheap , <unk> warfare , instead of being decently scared by the appearance of the military , this sort of arrangement does not seem wise .
the bond between the states is of an amazing tenuity .
so long as they do not absolutely march into the district of columbia , sit on the washington statues , and invent a flag of their own , they can <unk> , lynch , hunt negroes through swamps , divorce , railroad , and <unk> as much as ever they choose .
they do not need knowledge of their own military strength to back their genial lawlessness .
that regular army , which is a dear little army , should be kept to itself , blooded on detachment duty , turned into the paths of science , and now and again assembled at feasts of free masons , and so forth .
it is too <name> to be a political power .
the immortal wreck of the grand army of the republic is a political power of the largest and most <unk> description .
it ought not to help to lay the foundations of an amateur military power that is blind and irresponsible .
by great good luck the <unk> train , already delayed twelve hours by a burned bridge , brought me to the city on a saturday by way of that valley which the mormons , over their efforts , had caused to <name> like the rose .
twelve hours previously i had entered into a new world where , in conversation , every one was either a mormon or a gentile .
it is not seemly for a free and independent citizen to dub himself a gentile , but the mayor of <unk>  which is the gentile city of the valley  told me that there must be some distinction between the two flocks .
long before the fruit orchards of <name> or the shining levels of the salt lake had been reached , that mayor  himself a gentile , and one renowned for his dealings with the mormons  told me that the great question of the existence of the power within the power was being gradually solved by the ballot and by education .
all the beauty of the valley could not make me forget it .
and the valley is very fair .
bench after bench of land , flat as a table against the flanks of the ringing hills , marks where the salt lake rested for awhile in its collapse from an inland sea to a lake fifty miles long and thirty broad .
there are the <unk> of a very fine creed about <unk> .
to begin with , the church is rather more absolute than that of rome .
drop the polygamy plank in the platform , but on the other hand deal lightly with certain forms of excess ; keep the quality of the recruit down to the low mental level , and see that the best of all the agricultural science available is in the hands of the elders , and there you have a first-class engine for pioneer work .
the tawdry <unk> and the borrowing from <unk> serve the low caste swede and <name> , the welshman and the <unk> <unk> , just as well as a highly organized heaven .
then i went about the streets and peeped into people 's front windows , and the decorations upon the tables were after the manner of the year 1850 .
main street was full of country folk from the desert , come in to trade with the zion mercantile <unk> institute .
the church , i fancy , looks after the finances of this thing , and it consequently pays good dividends .
the faces of the women were not lovely .
<unk> , but for the certainty that ugly persons are just as irrational in the matter of undivided love as the beautiful , it seems that polygamy was a blessed institution for the women , and that only the dread threats of the spiritual power could drive the <unk> , <unk> men into it .
the women wore hideous garments , and the men appeared to be tied up with strings .
they would market all that afternoon , and on <name> go to the <unk> .
i tried to talk to a few of them , but they spoke strange tongues , and stared and behaved like cows .
yet one woman , and not an altogether ugly one , confided to me that she hated the idea of salt lake city being turned into a <unk> for the amusement of the gentiles .
" if we 'have our own institutions , that ai n't no reason why people should come 'ere and stare at us , his it ? "
the dropped " h " betrayed her .
" and when did you leave england ? "
i said .
" summer of <unk> .
i am dorset , " she said .
" the mormon agent was very good to us , and we was very poor .
now we 're better off  my father , an' mother , an ' me . "
" then you like the state ? "
she misunderstood at first .
" oh , i ai n't livin ' in the state of polygamy .
not me , yet .
i ain't married .
i like where i am .
i 've got things o ' my own  and some land . "
" but i suppose you <name>  " " not me .
i ai n't like them swedes an ' danes .
i ai n't got nothin ' to say for or against polygamy .
it 's the elders ' business , an ' between you an' me , i do n't think it 's going on much longer .
you 'll 'ear them in the 'ouse <unk> talkin ' as if it was <unk> ' all over <name> .
the swedes , they think it his .
i know it his n't . "
" but you 've got your land all right ? "
" oh , yes ; we 've got our land , an ' we never say aught against polygamy , o ' course  father , an ' mother , an ' me . "
on a table-land overlooking all the city stands the united states garrison of infantry and artillery .
the state of utah can do nearly anything it pleases until that <unk> hour when the gentile vote shall quietly swamp out <unk> ; but the garrison is kept there in case of accidents .
the big , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> farmers sometimes take to their creed with wildest fanaticism , and in past years have made life excessively unpleasant for the gentile when he was few in the land .
but to-day , so far from killing openly or secretly , or burning gentile farms , it is all the mormon dare do to feebly try to <unk> the <unk> .
his journals preach defiance to the united states government , and in the <unk> on a <name> the preachers follow suit .
when i went there , the place was full of people who would have been much better for a washing .
a man rose up and told them that they were the chosen of god , the elect of <name> ; that they were to obey their priests , and that there was a good time coming .
i fancy that they had heard all this before so many times it produced no impression whatever , even as the <unk> mysteries of another <name> lose salt through constant <unk> .
they breathed heavily through their noses , and stared straight in front of them  impassive as flat fish .
vii .
<name> 's defenceless coasts just suppose that <name> were twenty days distant from england .
then a man could study its customs with undivided soul ; but being so very near next door , he goes about the land with one eye on the smoke of the <unk> of the old country across the seas , while with the other he <unk> <unk> and <unk> at the alien .
i can lay my hand upon my sacred heart and affirm that up to to-day i have never taken three consecutive trips by rail without being delayed by an accident .
that it was an accident to another train makes no difference .
my own turn may come next .
a few miles from peaceful , <unk> <unk> they had managed to upset an express goods train to the detriment of the flimsy permanent way ; and thus the train which should have left at three departed at seven in the evening .
i was not angry .
i was scarcely even interested .
when an american train starts on time i begin to anticipate disaster  a visitation for such good luck , you understand .
buffalo is a large village of a quarter of a million inhabitants , situated on the seashore , which is falsely called lake erie .
it is a peaceful place , and more like an english county town than most of its friends .
once clear of the main business streets , you launch upon miles and miles of <unk> roads running between cottages and <unk> residences of those who have money and peace .
all the eastern cities own this fringe of elegance , but except in chicago nowhere is the fringe deeper or more heavily widened than in buffalo .
the american <name> go to a bad place because he can not speak english , and is proud of it ; but he knows how to make a home for himself and his mate , knows how to keep the grass green in front of his veranda , and how to fullest use the mechanism of life  hot water , gas , good <unk> , <unk> , etc .
his shops sell him delightful household <unk> at very moderate rates , and he is encompassed with all manner of <unk> appliances .
this does not prevent his wife and his daughter working themselves to death over household drudgery ; but the intention is good .
when you have seen the outside of a few hundred thousand of these homes and the insides of a few score , you begin to understand why the american ( the respectable one ) does not take a deep interest in what they call " politics , " and why he is so vaguely and generally proud of the country that enables him to be so comfortable .
how can the owner of a dainty chalet , with <unk> furniture , imitation venetian tapestry curtains , hot and cold water laid on , a bed of geraniums and <unk> , a baby crawling down the veranda , and a <unk> <unk> hose gently hissing over the grass in the balmy dusk of an <name> evening  how can such a man despair of the republic , or descend into the streets on voting days and mix cheerfully with " the boys " ?
no , it is the stranger  the homeless jackal of a stranger  whose interest in the country is limited to his <unk> and a <unk> , that can run from <name> to <unk> , crying :  " all is barren ! "
every good american wants a home  a pretty house and a little piece of land of his very own ; and every other good american seems to get it .
it was when my gigantic intellect was <unk> with this question that i confirmed a discovery half made in the west .
the natives of most classes marry young  absurdly young .
one of my informants  not the <unk> husband i met on lake <unk>  said that from twenty to twenty-four was about the usual time for this folly .
and when i asked whether the practice was confined to the <unk> <unk> classes , he said " no " very quickly .
he said it was a general custom , and nobody saw anything wrong with it .
" i guess , perhaps , very early marriage may account for a good deal of the divorce , " said he , reflectively .
whereat i was silent .
their marriages and their <unk> only concern these people ; and neither i travelling , nor you , who may come after , have any right to make rude remarks about them .
only  only coming from a land where a man begins to lightly turn to thoughts of love not before he is thirty , i own that playing at <unk> before that age rather surprised me .
out in the west , though , they marry , boys and girls , from sixteen upward , and i have met more than one bride of fifteen  husband aged twenty .
" when man and woman are agreed , what can the <unk> do ? "
from those peaceful homes , and the envy they inspire ( two trunks and a walking-stick and a bit of pine forest in british columbia are not satisfactory , any way you look at them ) , i turned me to the lake front of buffalo , where the steamers bellow to the grain <unk> , and the locomotives yell to the <unk> , and the canal barges <unk> the <unk> half a mile long as it snakes across the water in tow of a launch , and earth , and sky , and sea alike are thick with smoke .
in the old days , before the railway ran into the city , all the business quarters fringed the <unk> where the traffic was largest .
to-day the business quarters have gone <unk> to meet the railroad ; the lake traffic still exists , but you shall find a narrow belt of <unk> desolation , broken windows , <unk> doors , and streets where the grass grows between the crowded wharves and the bustling city .
to the lake front comes wheat from chicago , lumber , coal , and ore , and a large trade in cheap excursionists .
it was my felicity to catch a grain steamer and an elevator emptying that same steamer .
the steamer might have been two thousand tons burden .
she was laden with wheat in bulk ; from stem to stern , thirteen feet deep , lay the clean , red wheat .
there was no twenty-five per cent dirt <unk> about it at all .
it was wheat , fit for the <unk> as it lay .
they <unk> the <unk> of that steamer directly under an elevator  a house of red tin a hundred and fifty feet high .
then they let down into that <unk> a trunk as if it had been the trunk of an elephant , but stiff , because it was a pipe of <unk> wood .
and the trunk had a <unk> nose to it , and contained an endless chain of steel buckets .
then the captain swore , raising his eyes to heaven , and a gruff voice answered him from the place he swore at , and certain machinery , also in the firmament , began to clack , and the glittering , <unk> nose of that trunk burrowed into the wheat , and the wheat quivered and sunk upon the instant as water sinks when the <unk> sucks , because the steel buckets within the trunk were flying upon their endless round , carrying away each its appointed morsel of wheat .
the elevator was a persian well wheel  a wheel <unk> out thin and cased in a pipe , a wheel driven not by bullocks , but by much <unk> , licking up the grain at the rate of <unk> of bushels the hour .
and the wheat sunk into the <unk> while a man looked  sunk till the brown timbers of the <unk> showed bare , and men leaped down through clouds of golden dust and <unk> the wheat furiously round the nose of the trunk , and got a <unk> of glittering steel and made that shovel also , till there remained of the grain not more than a horse leaves in the fold of his <unk> .
in this manner do they handle wheat at buffalo .
on one side of the elevator is the steamer , on the other the railway track ; and the wheat is loaded into the cars in bulk .
wah !
wah !
god is great , and i do not think he ever intended <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> to supply england with her wheat .
<name> can cut in not without profit to herself when her harvest is good and the american yield poor ; but this very big country can , upon the average , supply the earth with all the beef and bread that is required .
a man in the train said to me :  " we kin feed all the earth , jest as easily as we kin whip all the earth . "
now the second statement is as false as the first is true .
one of these days the respectable republic <name> find this out .
unfortunately we , the english , <name> never be the people to teach her ; because she is a chartered <unk> allowed to say and do anything she likes , from demanding the head of the empress in an editorial <unk> , to <unk> canadian schooners up and down the alaska seas .
it is perfectly impossible to go to war with these people , whatever they may do .
they are much too nice , in the first place , and in the second , it would throw out all the passenger traffic of the atlantic , and upset the financial arrangements of the english <unk> who have invested their money in <unk> , railways , and the like , and in the third , it 's not to be done .
everybody knows that , and no one better than the american .
yet there are other powers who are not " <unk> band " ( of the brotherhood )  <name> , for instance .
try to believe an irresponsible writer when he assures you that <name> 's fleet to-day , if properly manned , could waft the entire american navy out of the water and into the blue .
the big , fat republic that is afraid of nothing , because nothing up to the present date has happened to make her afraid , is as unprotected as a <unk> .
not internally , of course  it would be madness for any power to throw men into <name> ; they would die  but as far as regards coast defence .
from five miles out at sea ( i have seen a test of her " fortified " ports ) a ship of the power of h. m. s. " <unk> " ( they have n't run her on a rock yet ) would wipe out any or every town from san <name> to long branch ; and three first-class <unk> would account for new york , <unk> 's statue and all .
reflect on this .
'twould be " pay up or go up " round the entire coast of the united states .
to this furiously answers the patriotic american :  " we should not pay .
we should invent a <unk> in pittsburg or  or anywhere else , and blow any outsider into h  l. " they might invent .
they might lay waste their cities and retire inland , for they can subsist entirely on their own produce .
meantime , in a war waged the only way it could be waged by an unscrupulous power , their coast cities and their <unk> would be ashes .
they could construct their navy inland if they liked , but you could never bring a ship down to the <unk> , as they stand now .
they could not , with an ordinary water patrol , despatch one regiment of men six miles across the seas .
there would be about five million excessively angry , armed men pent up within american limits .
these men would require ships to get themselves afloat .
the country has no such ships , and until the ships were built new york need not be allowed a <unk> carriage within her limits .
behold now the glorious condition of this republic which has no fear .
there is ransom and loot past the counting of man on her seaboard alone  plunder that would enrich a nation  and she has neither a navy nor half a dozen first-class ports to guard the whole .
no man catches a snake by the tail , because the creature <name> sting ; but you can build a fire around a snake that <name> make it squirm .
the country is supposed to be building a navy now .
when the ships are completed her alliance <name> be worth having  if the alliance of any republic can be relied upon .
for the next three years she can be hurt , and badly hurt .
pity it is that she is of our own blood , looking at the matter from a <unk> point of view .
dog can not eat dog .
these sinful reflections were prompted by the sight of the beautifully unprotected condition of buffalo  a city that could be made to pay up five million dollars without feeling it .
there are her companies of infantry in a sort of port there .
a <unk> brought over in pieces from niagara could get the money and get away before she could be caught , while an <unk> <unk> guarding <unk> could <unk> the towns on the lakes .
when one hears so much of the nation that can whip the earth , it is , to say the least of it , surprising to find her so <unk> <unk> .
the average american citizen seems to have a notion that any power engaged in strife with the <name> spangled banner <name> <unk> men from flat-bottomed boats on a convenient beach for the purpose of being shot down by local militia .
in his own simple phraseology :  " not by a darned sight .
no , sir . "
ransom at long range <name> be about the size of it  cash or crash .
let us <unk> calmer scenes .
in the heart of buffalo there stands a magnificent building which the population do innocently style a <unk> .
everybody comes here of evenings to sit around little tables and listen to a first-class orchestra .
the place is something like the gaiety theatre at simla , enlarged twenty times .
the " light brigade " of buffalo occupy the boxes and the stage , " as it was at simla in the days of old , " and the others sit in the <unk> .
here i went with a friend  poor or <unk> is the man who can not pick up a friend for a season in <name>  and here was shown the really smart folk of the city .
i grieve to say i laughed , because when an american wishes to be correct he sets himself to imitate the englishman .
this he does <unk> , and earns not only the contempt of his brethren , but the amused scorn of the briton .
i saw one man who was pointed out to me as being the glass of fashion hereabouts .
he was aggressively english in his <unk> .
from eye-glass to <unk> the illusion was perfect , but  he wore with <unk> buttoned boots with brown cloth tops !
not till i wandered about this land did i understand why the comic papers <unk> the <unk> .
certain young men of the more idiotic sort launch into <unk> and raiment of english cut , and here in buffalo they play polo at four in the afternoon .
i saw three youths come down to the <unk> <unk> attired for the game and mounted on their best ponies .
expecting a game , i lingered ; but i was mistaken .
these three shining ones with the very new yellow hide boots and the red silk sashes had assembled themselves for the purpose of knocking the ball about .
they smote with great solemnity up and down the grounds , while the little boys looked on .
when they trotted , which was not seldom , they rose and sunk in their stirrups with a <unk> that cried out " <unk> ! "
from afar .
other young men in the park were riding after the english manner , in neatly cut <unk> and light saddles .
fate in derision had made each youth <unk> his animal with a checkered enamelled leather <unk> visible half a mile away  a <unk> checkered <unk> !
they ca n't do it , any more than an englishman , by taking cold , can add that indescribable nasal <unk> to his orchestra .
the other sight of the evening was a horror .
the little tragedy played itself out at a neighboring table where two very young men and two very young women were sitting .
it did not strike me till far into the evening that the <unk> young <unk> were making the girls drunk .
they gave them red wine and then white , and the voices rose slightly with the maidens ' cheek <unk> .
i watched , wishing to stay , and the youths drank till their speech thickened and their <unk> grew watery .
it was sickening to see , because i knew what was going to happen .
my friend eyed the group , and said :  " maybe they 're children of respectable people .
i hardly think , though , they 'd be allowed out without any better escort than these boys .
and yet the place is a place where every one comes , as you see .
they may be little <unk>  in which case they would n't be so hopelessly overcome with two glasses of wine .
they may be  " whatever they were they got indubitably drunk  there in that lovely hall , surrounded by the best of buffalo society .
one could do nothing except <unk> the judgment of heaven on the two boys , themselves half sick with liquor .
at the close of the performance the quieter maiden laughed vacantly and protested she could n't keep her feet .
the four linked arms , and staggering , flickered out into the street  drunk , gentlemen and ladies , as davy 's swine , drunk as lords !
they disappeared down a side avenue , but i could hear their laughter long after they were out of sight .
and they were all four children of sixteen and seventeen .
then , <unk> previous opinions , i became a <unk> .
better it is that a man should go without his beer in public places , and content himself with swearing at the <unk> of the majority ; better it is to poison the inside with very vile temperance drinks , and to buy lager furtively at <unk> , than to bring temptation to the lips of young fools such as the four i had seen .
i understand now why the preachers rage against drink .
i have said : " there is no harm in it , taken moderately ; " and yet my own demand for beer helped directly to send those two girls reeling down the dark street to  god alone knows what end .
if liquor is worth drinking , it is worth taking a little trouble to come at  such trouble as a man <name> undergo to compass his own desires .
it is not good that we should let it lie before the eyes of children , and i have been a fool in writing to the contrary .
very sorry for myself , i sought a hotel , and found in the hall a reporter who wished to know what i thought of the country .
him i lured into conversation about his own profession , and from him gained much that confirmed me in my views of the grinding tyranny of that thing which they call the press here .
thus :  i  but you talk about interviewing people whether they like it or not .
have you no bounds beyond which even your indecent curiosity must not go ?
he  i have n't struck 'em yet .
what do you think of interviewing a widow two hours after her husband 's death , to get her version of his life ?
i  i think that is the work of a ghoul .
must the people have no privacy ?
he  there is no domestic privacy in <name> .
if there was , what the deuce would the papers do ?
see here .
some time ago i had an <unk> to write up the <unk> <unk> when a prominent citizen had died .
i  translate , please ; i do not understand your pagan rites and ceremonies .
he  i was ordered by the office to describe the flowers , and wreaths , and so on , that had been sent to a dead man 's funeral .
well , i went to the house .
there was no one there to stop me , so i <unk> the <unk>  pulled the <name>  and drifted into the room where the corpse lay all among the roses and <unk> .
i whipped out my note-book and pawed around among the <unk> <unk> , <unk> up the tickets on the wreaths and seeing who had sent them .
in the middle of this i heard some one saying : " please , oh , please ! "
behind me , and there stood the daughter of the house , just bathed in tears  i  you unmitigated brute !
he  pretty much what i felt myself .
" i 'm very sorry , miss , " i said , " to intrude on the privacy of your grief .
trust me , i shall make it as little painful as possible . "
i  but by what conceivable right did you outrage  he  hold your horses .
i 'm telling you .
well , she did n't want me in the house at all , and between her sobs fairly waved me away .
i had half the <unk> described , though , and the balance i did partly on the steps when the stiff 'un came out , and partly in the church .
the preacher gave the sermon .
that was n't my <unk> .
i skipped about among the <unk> <unk> while he was talking .
i could have made no excuse if i had gone back to the office and said that a pretty girl 's sobs had stopped me obeying orders .
i had to do it .
what do you think of it all ?
i ( slowly )  do you want to know ?
he ( with his note-book ready )  of course .
how do you regard it ?
i  it makes me regard your interesting nation with the same shuddering curiosity that i should bestow on a <unk> <unk> chewing the scalp off his mother 's skull .
does that convey any idea to your mind ?
it makes me regard the whole pack of you as <unk>  real <unk>  not the sort you send missions to  creatures of another flesh and blood .
you ought to have been shot , not dead , but through the stomach , for your share in the scandalous business , and the thing you call your newspaper ought to have been sacked by the mob , and the managing proprietor hanged .
he  from which , i suppose you have nothing of that kind in your country ?
oh !
" pioneer , " venerable " pioneer , " and you not less honest press of <name> , who are occasionally dull but never <unk> , what could i say ?
a mere " no , " shouted never so loudly , would not have met the needs of the case .
i said no word .
the reporter went away , and i took a train for niagara falls , which are twenty-two miles distant from this bad town , where girls get drunk of nights and reporters trample on corpses in the drawing-rooms of the brave and the free !

fuzzy-wuzzy ( soudan <unk> force ) we 've fought with many men acrost the seas , an ' some of 'em was brave an ' some was not : the paythan an ' the zulu an ' burmese ; but the fuzzy was the finest o ' the lot .

now 'is work begins by gawd knows when , and 'is work is never through ; 'e is n't one o ' the reg'lar line , nor 'e is n't one of the crew .
'e 's a kind of a giddy <unk>  soldier an ' sailor too !
an ' after i met 'im all over the world , a-doin ' all kinds of things , like <unk> ' 'isself with a <unk> ' gun to talk to them 'eathen kings ; 'e sleeps in an <unk> instead of a cot , an ' 'e drills with the deck on a slew , an ' 'e <unk> like a jolly  'er majesty 's jolly  soldier an ' sailor too !

you may say we are fond of an <unk> , or <unk> ' in <unk> , or <unk> ' a board school mutiny along o ' the onion guards ; but once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view , the same as the jollies  'er majesty 's jollies  soldier an ' sailor too !

to take your chance in the thick of a rush , with firing all about , is nothing so bad when you 've cover to 'and , an ' leave an ' <unk> ' to shout ; but to stand an ' be still to the <unk> drill is a damn tough bullet to chew , an ' they done it , the jollies  'er majesty 's jollies  soldier an ' sailor too !
their work was done when it 'ad n't begun ; they was younger nor me an ' you ; their choice it was plain between <unk> ' in <unk> an ' bein ' mopped by the screw , so they stood an ' was still to the <unk> drill , soldier an ' sailor too !

the jacket through the plagues of <unk> ' we was <unk> ' <unk> , gettin ' down an ' <unk> ' in the sun ; an ' you might 'ave called us dirty , an ' you might <name> ' called us dry , an ' you might 'ave 'eard us talkin ' at the gun .
but the captain 'ad 'is jacket , an ' the jacket it was new  ( 'orse gunners , listen to my song ! )
an ' the <unk> ' of the jacket is the proper thing to do , nor we did n't keep 'im waitin ' very long .
one day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt , <unk> ' down the <unk> with case ; but the captain knew 'is <unk> , an ' he took the crackers out an ' he put some proper liquor in its place .
an ' the captain saw the shrapnel , which is <unk> clear .
( 'orse gunners , listen to my song ! )
" <name> you draw the weight , " sez 'e , " or <name> you draw the beer ? "
an ' we did n't keep 'im waitin ' very long .
for the captain , etc .
then we trotted gentle , not to break the bloomin ' glass , though the <unk> 'ad all their ranges marked ; but we <unk> n't <unk> gallop , for the most was bottled bass , an ' we 'd dreamed of it since we was disembarked : so we fired economic with the shells we 'ad in 'and , ( 'orse gunners , listen to my song ! )
but the beggars under cover 'ad the <unk> to stand , an ' we could n't keep 'em waitin ' very long .
and the captain , etc .
so we finished 'arf the liquor ( an ' the captain took champagne ) , an ' the <unk> was shootin ' all the while ; an ' we left our wounded 'appy with the empties on the plain , an ' we used the bloomin ' guns for <unk> !
we <unk> up an ' galloped  there were nothin ' else to do  ( 'orse gunners , listen to my song ! )
an ' the battery came <unk> ' like a <unk> ' kangaroo , but they did n't watch us comin ' very long .
as the captain , etc .
we was goin ' most extended  we was drivin ' very fine , an ' the <unk> were <unk> ' <unk> an ' wide , till the captain took the glassy with a <unk> ' right incline , an ' we dropped upon their <unk> the other side .
then we give 'em quarter  such as 'ad n't up and cut , ( 'orse gunners , listen to my song ! )
an ' the captain stood a <unk> of <unk>  somethin ' <unk> , but we did n't leave it <unk> very long .
for the captain , etc .
we might <name> ' been <unk> , but it all come out all right when they signalled us to join the main command .
there was every round expended , there was every gunner tight , an ' the captain waved a corkscrew in 'is 'and .
but the captain 'ad 'is jacket , etc .
the 'eathen the 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an ' stone ; 'e do n't obey no orders unless they is 'is own ; 'e keeps 'is <unk> awful : 'e leaves 'em all about , an ' then comes up the regiment an ' <unk> the 'eathen out .
all along o ' <unk> , all along o ' mess , all along o ' doin ' things <unk> , all along of <unk> , <unk> , an ' <unk> , mind you keep your rifle an ' yourself <unk> ' so !
the young recruit is <unk>  'e draf 's from gawd knows where ; they bid 'im show 'is <unk> 's an ' lay 'is mattress square ; 'e calls it bloomin ' nonsense  'e does n't know no more  an ' then up comes 'is company an ' kicks 'im round the floor !
the young recruit is <unk>  'e takes it very 'ard ; 'e <unk> 'is 'ead an ' <unk>  'e <unk> about the yard ; 'e talks o ' " cruel tyrants " 'e 'll swing for <unk> , an ' the others <unk> an ' mocks 'im , an ' the boy goes orf to cry .
the young recruit is silly  'e thinks o ' suicide ; 'e 's lost 'is <unk> ; 'e 'as n't got 'is pride ; but day by day they kicks 'im , which <unk> 'im on a bit , till 'e finds 'isself one mornin ' with a full an ' proper <name> .
gettin ' clear o ' <unk> , gettin ' done with mess , gettin ' shut o ' doin ' things <unk> ; not so fond of <unk> , <unk> , nor <unk> , learns to keep 'is rifle an ' 'isself <unk> ' so !
the young recruit is 'appy  'e throws a chest to suit ; you see 'im grow <unk> ; you 'ear 'im slap 'is boot ; 'e learns to drop the " <unk> " from every word 'e slings , an ' 'e shows an <unk> <unk> when 'e strips for bars an ' rings .
the <unk> they watch 'im 'arf a year ; they watch 'im with 'is comrades , they watch 'im with 'is beer ; they watch 'im with the women at the regimental dance , and the <unk> send 'is name along for " <name> " .
an ' now 'e 's 'arf o ' nothin ' , an ' all a private yet , 'is room they up an ' rags 'im to see what they <name> get ; they rags 'im low an ' <unk> ' , each dirty trick they can , but 'e learns to sweat 'is temper an ' 'e learns to sweat 'is man .
an ' , last , a colour-sergeant , as such to be obeyed , 'e schools 'is men at cricket , 'e tells 'em on parade ; they sees 'em quick an ' <unk> , uncommon set an ' smart , an ' so 'e talks to <unk> which 'ave the core at 'eart .
'e learns to do 'is watchin ' without it showin ' plain ; 'e learns to save a dummy , an ' shove 'im straight again ; 'e learns to check a <unk> that 's <unk> ' leave to shirk ; an ' 'e learns to make men like 'im so they 'll learn to like their work .
an ' when it comes to marchin ' he 'll see their socks are right , an ' when it comes to action 'e shows 'em 'ow to sight ; 'e knows their ways of thinkin ' and just what 's in their mind ; 'e knows when they are takin ' on an ' when they 've fell be'ind .
'e knows each talkin ' <unk> that leads a squad astray ; 'e feels 'is <unk> <unk> ' , 'is bowels givin ' way ; 'e sees the blue-white faces all tryin ' 'ard to grin , an ' 'e stands an ' waits an ' suffers till it 's time to cap 'em in .
an ' now the <unk> bullets come <unk> ' through the dust , an ' no one wants to face 'em , but every beggar must ; so , like a man in irons which is n't glad to go , they moves 'em off by companies uncommon stiff an ' slow .
of all 'is five years ' <unk> ' they do n't remember much excep ' the not <unk> ' , the step an ' keepin ' touch .
it looks like <unk> ' wasted when they duck an ' spread an ' 'op , but if 'e 'ad n't learned 'em they 'd be all about the shop !
an ' now it 's " 'oo goes backward ? "
an ' now it 's " 'oo comes on ? "
and now it 's " get the doolies , " an ' now the captain 's gone ; an ' now it 's bloody murder , but all the while they 'ear 'is voice , the same as <unk> drill , <unk> ' the rear .
'e 's just as sick as they are , 'is 'eart is like to split , but 'e works 'em , works 'em , works 'em till he feels 'em take the bit ; the rest is <unk> ' steady till the watchful bugles play , an ' 'e lifts 'em , lifts 'em , lifts 'em through the charge that wins the day !
the 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an ' stone ; 'e do n't obey no orders unless they is 'is own ; the 'eathen in 'is blindness must end where 'e began , but the backbone of the army is the <unk> man !
keep away from <unk>  keep away from mess .
do n't get into doin ' things <unk> !
let 's <name> ' done with <unk> , <unk> , an ' <unk> ; mind you keep your rifle an ' yourself <unk> ' so !
the <unk> sentry sez the <name> orderly sergeant to the senior orderly man : " our orderly orf'cer 's <unk> , you 'elp 'im all you can .
for the wine was old and the night is cold , an ' the best we may go wrong , so , 'fore 'e gits to the sentry-box , you pass the word along . "
so it was " rounds !
what rounds ? "
at two of a frosty night , 'e 's <unk> ' on by the sergeant 's sash , but , sentry , shut your eye .
an ' it was " pass !
all 's well ! "
oh , ai n't 'e <unk> ' tight !
'e 'll need an <unk> pretty badly <unk> .
the moon was white on the barricks , the road was white an ' wide , an ' the orderly orf'cer took it all , an ' the ten-foot ditch beside .
an ' the corporal pulled an ' the sergeant pushed , an ' the three they danced along , but i 'd shut my eyes in the sentry-box , so i did n't see nothin ' wrong .
though it was " rounds !
what rounds ? "
o corporal , 'old 'im up !
'e 's usin ' 'is cap as it should n't be used , but , sentry , shut your eye .
an ' it was " pass !
all 's well ! "
ho , shun the <unk> ' cup !
'e 'll need , etc .
't was after four in the mornin ' ; we 'ad to stop the fun , an ' we sent 'im 'ome on a bullock-cart , with 'is belt an ' stock undone ; but we sluiced 'im down an ' we washed 'im out , an ' a first-class job we made , when we saved 'im , smart as a <unk> , for <unk> parade .
it 'ad been " rounds !
what rounds ? "
oh , shove 'im straight again !
'e 's usin ' 'is sword for a bicycle , but , sentry , shut your eye .
an ' it was " pass !
all 's well ! "
'e 's called me " darlin ' <name> " !
'e 'll need , etc .
the drill was long an ' <unk> , the sky was 'ot an ' blue , an ' 'is eye was wild an ' 'is 'air was wet , but 'is sergeant pulled 'im through .
our men was good old <unk>  they 'd done it on their 'ead ; but you ought to 'ave 'eard 'em <unk> ' time to 'ide the things 'e said !
for it was " right flank  wheel ! "
for " 'alt , an ' stand at ease ! "
an ' " left extend ! "
for " centre close ! "
o marker , shut your eye !
an ' it was , " 'ere , sir , 'ere !
before the colonel sees ! "
so he needed <unk> pretty badly <unk> .
there was <unk> sergeants , there was <unk> forty-one , there was just nine 'undred rank an ' file to swear to a touch o ' sun .
there was me 'e 'd kissed in the sentry-box , as i 'ave not told in my song , but i took my oath , which were bible truth , i 'ad n't seen nothin ' wrong .
there 's them that 's 'ot an ' <unk> , there 's them that 's cold an ' 'ard , but there comes a night when the best gets tight , and then turns out the guard .
i 've seen them 'ide their liquor in every kind o ' way , but most depends on makin ' friends with privit <name> a. !
when it is " rounds !
what rounds ? "
'e 's breathin ' through 'is nose .
'e 's <unk> ' , rollin ' , roarin ' tight , but , sentry , shut your eye .
an ' it is " pass !
all 's well ! "
an ' that 's the way it goes : we 'll 'elp 'im for 'is mother , an ' 'e 'll 'elp us <unk> !
<unk> , pity women ! '
you call yourself a man , for all you used to swear , an ' leave me , as you can , my certain shame to bear ?

you do not care  you done the worst you know .
i <unk> you , grinnin ' there ... . ah , gawd , i love you so !
nice while it lasted , an ' now it is over  tear out your 'eart an ' good-bye to your lover !
what 's the use o ' <unk> ' , when the mother that bore you ( <name> , pity women ! )
knew it all before you ?
it are n't no false alarm , the finish to your fun ; you  you 'ave brung the 'arm , an ' i 'm the ruined one ; an ' now you 'll off an ' run with some new fool in tow .
your 'eart ?
you 'ave n't none ... . ah , gawd , i love you so !
when a man is tired there is naught <name> bind 'im ; all 'e solemn promised 'e <name> shove be'ind 'im .
what 's the good o ' <unk> ' for the wrath to strike 'im ( <name> , pity women !

what 'ope for me or  it ?
what 's left for us to do ?
i 've walked with men a bit , but this  but this is you .
so 'elp me christ , it 's true !
where can i 'ide or go ?

ah , gawd , i love you so !
all the more you give 'em the less are they for givin '  love lies dead , an ' you can not kiss 'im livin ' .
down the road 'e led you there is no <unk> ( <name> , pity women !

you 'd like to treat me fair ?
you ca n't , because we 're pore ?
we 'd starve ?
what do i care !
we might , but this is shore !
i want the name  no more  the name , an ' lines to show , an ' not to be an <unk> ... . ah , gawd , i love you so !
what 's the good o ' <unk> ' , when the mother that bore you ( <name> , pity women ! )

sleep on 'is promises an ' wake to your sorrow ( <name> , pity women !

for to admire the injian ocean sets an ' smiles so <unk> ' , so bright , so bloomin ' blue ; there are n't a wave for miles an ' miles excep ' the <unk> from the screw .
the ship is <unk> ' , the day is done , the bugle 's gone for smoke and play ; an ' black agin ' the settin ' sun the lascar sings , " hum <unk> <name> ! "
for to admire an ' for to see , for to <unk> this world so wide  it never done no good to me , but i ca n't drop it if i tried !
i see the sergeants <unk> ' <unk> , i 'ear the women laugh an ' talk , i spy upon the quarter-deck the <unk> an ' <unk> walk .
i thinks about the things that was , an ' leans an ' looks acrost the sea , till spite of all the crowded ship there 's no one lef ' alive but me .
the things that was which i 'ave seen , in <unk> , camp , an ' action too , i tells them over by myself , an ' sometimes wonders if they 're true ; for they was odd  most awful odd  but all the same now they are o'er , there must be <unk> o ' plenty such , an ' if i wait i 'll see some more .
oh , i 'ave come upon the books , an ' frequent broke a <unk> rule , an ' stood beside an ' watched myself <unk> ' like a bloomin ' fool .
i paid my price for <unk> ' out , nor never <unk> the price i paid , but sat in clink without my boots , <unk> ' 'ow the world was made .
<unk> a crowd upon the beam , an ' <unk> above the sea appears old <unk> , like a <unk> that no one 's lit for years an ' years !
i passed by that when i began , an ' i go 'ome the road i came , a time-expired <unk> with six years ' service to 'is name .
my girl she said , " oh , stay with me ! "
my mother <unk> me to 'er breast .
they 've never written none , an ' so they must 'ave gone with all the rest  with all the rest which i 'ave seen an ' found an ' known an ' met along .
i can not say the things i feel , and so i sing my evenin ' song : for to admire an ' for to see , for to <unk> this world so wide  it never done no good to me , but i ca n't drop it if i tried !
" captains courageous " a story of the grand banks by rudyard kipling chapter i the weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the north atlantic fog , as the big liner rolled and lifted , whistling to warn the <unk> .
" that cheyne boy 's the biggest nuisance aboard , " said a man in a <unk> overcoat , shutting the door with a bang .
" he is n't wanted here .
he's too fresh . "
a white-haired <name> reached for a sandwich , and grunted between bites : " i know der breed .
<unk> is full of <name> kind .
i <name> you you should <unk> ropes ' ends free under your <unk> . "
" pshaw !
there is n't any real harm to him .
he 's more to be pitied than anything , " a man from new york drawled , as he lay at full length along the cushions under the wet skylight .
" they 've dragged him around from hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid .
i was talking to his mother this morning .
she 's a lovely <name> , but she do n't pretend to manage him .
he 's going to europe to finish his education . "
" education is n't begun yet . "
this was a <unk> , curled up in a corner .
" that boy gets two hundred a month <unk> , he told me .
he is n't sixteen either . "
" railroads , his father , <unk> it ? "
said the <name> .
" <unk> .
that and mines and lumber and shipping .
built one place at san <name> , the old man has ; another at los <name> ; owns half a dozen railroads , half the lumber on the pacific slope , and lets his wife spend the money , " the <unk> went on lazily .
" the west don't suit her , she says .
she just tracks around with the boy and her nerves , trying to find out what 'll amuse him , i guess .
<name> , adirondacks , <unk> , hot springs , new york , and round again .
he is n't much more than a second-hand hotel clerk now .
when he 's finished in europe he'll be a holy terror . "
" what 's the matter with the old man attending to him personally ? "
said a voice from the <unk> ulster .
" old man 's piling up the rocks .
'do n't want to be disturbed , i guess .
he 'll find out his error a few years from now .
<unk> , because there 's a heap of good in the boy if you could get at it . "
" mit a rope 's end ; mit a rope 's end ! "
growled the <name> .
once more the door banged , and a slight , <unk> boy perhaps fifteen years old , a <unk> cigarette hanging from one corner of his mouth , leaned in over the high <unk> .
his <name> yellow complexion did not show well on a person of his years , and his look was a mixture of <unk> , bravado , and very cheap smartness .
he was dressed in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , red stockings , and bicycle shoes , with a red flannel cap at the back of the head .
after whistling between his teeth , as he eyed the company , he said in a loud , high voice : " say , it 's thick outside .
you can hear the <unk> <unk> all around us .
say , would n't it be great if we ran down one ? "
" shut the door , <name> , " said the new <unk> .
" shut the door and stay outside .
you 're not wanted here . "
" who 'll stop me ? "
he answered deliberately .
" did you pay for my passage , mister <name> ?
'guess i 've as good right here as the next man . "
he picked up some dice from a <unk> and began throwing , right hand against left .
" say , <unk> , this is <unk> mud .
ca n't we make a game of poker between us ? "
there was no answer , and he puffed his cigarette , swung his legs , and drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers .
then he pulled out a roll of bills as if to count them .
" how 's your mamma this afternoon ? "
a man said .
" i did n't see her at lunch . "
" in her state-room , i guess .
she 's 'most always sick on the ocean .
i'm going to give the <unk> fifteen dollars for looking after her .
i do n't go down more 'n i can avoid .
it makes me feel mysterious to pass that <unk> place .
say , this is the first time i 've been on the ocean . "
" oh , do n't apologise , <name> . "
" who 's <unk> ?
this is the first time i 've crossed the ocean , <unk> , and , except the first day , i have n't been sick one little bit .
no , sir ! "
he brought down his fist with a triumphant bang , wetted his finger , and went on counting the bills .
" oh , you 're a <unk> machine , with the writing in plain sight , " the <unk> yawned .
" you 'll <name> into a credit to your country if you do n't take care . "
" i know it .
i 'm an american  first , last , and all the time .
i 'll show 'em that when i strike europe .
<unk> !
my <unk> 's out .
i ca n't smoke the truck the steward sells .
any <unk> got a real turkish <unk> on him ? "
the chief engineer entered for a moment , red , smiling , and wet .
" say , <name> , " cried <name> , cheerfully , " how are we hitting it ? "
" vara much in the ordinary way , " was the grave reply .
" the young are as polite as ever to their elders , an ' their elders are e'en tryin ' to appreciate it . "
a low chuckle came from a corner .
the <name> opened his <unk> and handed a skinny black cigar to <name> .
" <name> is der <unk> apparatus to smoke , my young <unk> , " he said .
" you vill dry it ?
yes ?
den you vill be <unk> so happy . "
<name> lit the unlovely thing with a flourish : he felt that he was getting on in grown-up society .
" it would take more 'n this to keel me over , " he said , ignorant that he was lighting that terrible article , a wheeling <unk> ' .
" <name> we shall <unk> see , " said the <name> .
" where are we now , mr .
<unk> ' ? "
" just there or thereabouts , mr. <unk> , " said the engineer .
" we 'll be on the grand bank to-night ; but in a general way o ' speakin ' , we 're all among the <unk> now .
we 've shaved three dories an' near <unk> the boom off a frenchman since noon , an ' that 's close <unk> ' , ye may say . "
" you like my cigar , eh ? "
the <name> asked , for <name> 's eyes were full of tears .
" fine , full flavour , " he answered through shut teeth .
" guess we've slowed down a little , have n't we ?
i 'll skip out and see what the log says . "
" i might if i <unk> you , " said the <name> .
<name> staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail .
he was very unhappy ; but he saw the <unk> lashing chairs together , and , since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick , his pride made him go aft to the <unk> deck at the stern , which was finished in a <unk> .
the deck was deserted , and he crawled to the extreme end of it , near the <unk> .
there he doubled up in limp agony , for the wheeling " <unk> " joined with the surge and jar of the screw to <unk> out his soul .
his head swelled ; sparks of fire danced before his eyes ; his body seemed to lose weight , while his heels wavered in the breeze .
he was fainting from seasickness , and a roll of the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the <unk> .
then a low , grey <unk> swung out of the fog , tucked <name> under one arm , so to speak , and pulled him off and away to leeward ; the great green closed over him , and he went quietly to sleep .
he was roused by the sound of a <unk> such as they used to blow at a <unk> he had once attended in the adirondacks .
slowly he remembered that he was <name> cheyne , drowned and dead in <unk> , but was too weak to fit things together .
a new smell filled his nostrils ; wet and clammy chills ran down his back , and he was helplessly full of salt water .
when he opened his eyes , he perceived that he was still on the top of the sea , for it was running round him in <unk> hills , and he was lying on a pile of <unk> fish , looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey .
" it 's no good , " thought the boy .
" i 'm dead , sure enough , and this thing is in charge . "
he groaned , and the figure turned its head , showing a pair of little gold rings half hidden in curly black hair .
" aha !
you feel some pretty well now ' ? "
it said .
" lie still so : we trim better . "
with a swift jerk he <unk> the flickering <unk> on to a <unk> sea that lifted her twenty full feet , only to slide her into a glassy pit beyond .
but this <unk> did not interrupt <unk> talk .
" fine good job , i say , that i catch you .
eh , wha-at ?
better good job , i say , your boat not catch me .
how you come to fall out ? "
" i was sick , " said <name> ; " sick , and could n't help it . "
" just in time i blow my horn , and your boat she <unk> a little .
then i see you come all down .
eh , wha-at ?
i think you are cut into <unk> by the screw , but you <unk>  <unk> to me , and i make a big fish of you .
so you shall not die this time . "
" where am i ? "
said <name> , who could not see that life was particularly safe where he lay .
" you are with me in the dory  <name> my name , and i come from schooner 'we 're here ' of gloucester .
i live to gloucester .
by-and-by we get supper .
eh , wha-at ? "
he seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron , for , not content with blowing through a big <unk> , he must needs stand up to it , swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory , and send a grinding , <unk> shriek through the fog .
how long this entertainment lasted , <name> could not remember , for he lay back terrified at the sight of the smoking swells .
he fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting .
something bigger than the dory , but quite as lively , loomed alongside .
several voices talked at once ; he was dropped into a dark , heaving hole , where men in <unk> gave him a hot drink and took off his clothes , and he fell asleep .
when he waked he listened for the first <unk> on the steamer , wondering why his stateroom had grown so small .
turning , he looked into a narrow , triangular cave , lit by a lamp <name> against a huge square beam .
a three-cornered table within arm 's reach ran from the <name> of the bows to the foremast .
at the after end , behind a <unk> plymouth stove , sat a boy about his own age , with a flat red face and a pair of twinkling grey eyes .
he was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber boots .
several pairs of the same sort of <unk> , an old cap , and some worn-out woolen socks lay on the floor , and black and yellow <unk> swayed to and fro beside the bunks .
the place was packed as full of smells as a bale is of cotton .
the <unk> had a peculiarly thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the smells of fried fish , burnt grease , paint , pepper , and stale tobacco ; but these , again , were all <unk> together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water .
<name> saw with disgust that there were no sheets on his <unk> .
he was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps and <unk> .
then , too , the boat 's motion was not that of a steamer .
she was neither sliding nor rolling , but rather wriggling herself about in a silly , aimless way , like a colt at the end of a halter .
<unk> ran by close to his ear , and beams creaked and whined about him .
all these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his mother .
" feelin ' better ? "
said the boy , with a grin .
" hev some coffee ? "
he brought a tin cup full , and sweetened it with molasses .
" is n't there milk ? "
said <name> , looking round the dark double tier of bunks as if he expected to find a cow there .
" well , no , " said the boy .
" ner there ai n't likely to be till <unk> <unk> .
'tai n't bad coffee .
i made it . "
<name> drank in silence , and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces of crisp fried pork , which he ate <unk> .
" i 've dried your clothes .
guess they 've shrunk some , " said the boy .
" they ai n't our style much  none of 'em .
twist round an ' see ef you're hurt any . "
<name> stretched himself in every direction , but could not report any injuries .
" that 's good , " the boy said heartily .
" fix yerself an ' go on deck .
dad wants to see you .
i 'm his son ,  <name> , they call me ,  an ' i 'm <unk> helper an ' everything else aboard that 's too dirty for the men .
there ai n't no boy here <unk> ' me sence <name> went overboard  an ' he was only a dutchy , an ' twenty year old at that .
how 'd you come to fall off in a dead flat <unk> ? "
" 't was n't a calm , " said <name> , sulkily .
" it was a <name> , and i was seasick .
guess i must have rolled over the rail . "
" there was a little common swell <unk> an ' last night , " said the boy .
" but ef thet 's your notion of a <name>   " he whistled .
" you 'll know more 'fore you 're through .
hurry !
dad 's waitin ' . "
like many other unfortunate young people , <name> had never in all his life received a direct order  never , at least , without long , and sometimes tearful , explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the request .
mrs. cheyne lived in fear of breaking his spirit , which , perhaps , was the reason that she herself walked on the edge of nervous prostration .
he could not see why he should be expected to hurry for any man 's pleasure , and said so .
" your dad can come down here if he 's so anxious to talk to me .
i want him to take me to new york right away .
it 'll pay him . "
<name> opened his eyes , as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him .
" say , dad ! "
he shouted up the fo'c'sle hatch , " he says you kin slip down an ' see him ef you 're anxious that way .
'hear , dad ? "
the answer came back in the deepest voice <name> had ever heard from a human chest : " quit <unk> ' , <name> , and send him to me . "
<name> <unk> , and threw <name> his warped bicycle shoes .
there was something in the tones on the deck that made the boy <unk> his extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually unfolding the tale of his own and his father 's wealth on the voyage home .
this rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for life .
he hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder , and stumbled aft , over a score of obstructions , to where a small , <unk> , clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led up to the quarter-deck .
the swell had passed in the night , leaving a long , oily sea , dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen <unk> .
between them lay little black specks , showing where the dories were out fishing .
the schooner , with a triangular <unk> on the mainmast , played easily at anchor , and except for the man by the <unk>  " house " they call it  she was deserted .
" mornin '  good afternoon , i should say .
you 've nigh <unk> ' the clock around , young feller , " was the greeting .
" mornin ' , " said <name> .
he did not like being called " young feller " ; and , as one rescued from drowning , expected sympathy .
his mother suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet ; but this mariner did not seem excited .
" naow let 's hear all abaout it .
it 's quite providential , first an' last , fer all concerned .
what might be your name ?
where from ( we mistrust it 's noo york ) , an ' where <unk> ( we mistrust it 's europe ) ? "
<name> gave his name , the name of the steamer , and a short history of the accident , winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to new york , where his father would pay anything any one chose to name .
" h 'm , " said the shaven man , quite unmoved by the end of <unk> speech .
" i ca n't say we think special of any man , or boy even , that falls overboard from that kind o ' packet in a flat <unk> .
least of all when his excuse is thet he 's seasick . "
" excuse ! "
cried <name> .
" d'you suppose i 'd fall overboard into your dirty little boat for fun ? "
" not knowin ' what your notions o ' fun may be , i ca n't rightly say , young feller .
but if i was you , i would n't call the boat which , under providence , was the means o ' savin ' ye , names .
in the first place , it's blame <unk> .
in the second , it 's <unk> ' to my feelin 's  an ' i'm disko troop o ' the " we 're here " o ' gloucester , which you do n't seem rightly to know . "
" i do n't know and i do n't care , " said <name> .
" i 'm grateful enough for being saved and all that , of course ; but i want you to understand that the sooner you take me back to new york the better it 'll pay you . "
" meanin '  haow ? "
troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously mild blue eye .
" dollars and cents , " said <name> , delighted to think that he was making an impression .
" cold dollars and cents . "
he thrust a hand into a pocket , and threw out his stomach a little , which was his way of being grand .
" you 've done the best day 's work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in .
i 'm all the son <name> cheyne has . "
" he 's bin favoured , " said disko , drily .
" and if you do n't know who <name> cheyne is , you do n't know much  that 's all .
now turn her around and let 's hurry . "
<name> had a notion that the greater part of <name> was filled with people discussing and <unk> his father 's dollars .
" mebbe i do , an ' mebbe i do n't .
take a reef in your stummick , young feller .
it 's full o ' my vittles . "
<name> heard a chuckle from <name> , who was pretending to be busy by the <unk> , and the blood rushed to his face .
" we 'll pay for that too , " he said .
" when do you suppose we shall get to new york ? "
" i do n't use noo york any .
ner boston .
we may see eastern point about <name> ; an ' your <name>  i 'm real sorry i <name> n't heerd tell of him  may give me ten dollars <unk> all your talk .
then o ' course he may n't . "
" ten dollars !
why , see here , i  " <name> dived into his pocket for the wad of bills .
all he brought up was a <unk> packet of cigarettes .
" not lawful currency , an ' bad for the lungs .
heave 'em overboard , young feller , and try ag'in . "
" it 's been stolen ! "
cried <name> , hotly .
" you 'll hev to wait till you see your <name> to reward me , then ? "
" a hundred and thirty-four dollars  all stolen , " said <name> , hunting wildly through his pockets .
" give them back . "
a curious change flitted across old troop 's hard face .
" what might you have been doin ' at your time o ' life with one hundred an ' thirty-four dollars , young feller ? "
" it was part of my <unk>  for a month . "
this <name> thought would be a <unk> blow , and it was  indirectly .
oh !
one hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his <unk>  for one month only !
you do n't remember <unk> ' anything when you fell over , do you ?
crack ag'in ' a <unk> , <name> 's say .
old man <unk> o ' the " east wind "  troop seemed to be talking to himself  " he tripped on a hatch an ' <unk> the mainmast with his head  <unk> .
<unk> three weeks afterwards , old man <unk> he would hev it that the " east wind " was a <unk> ' man-o'-war , an ' so he declared war on sable island because it was <unk> , an ' the shoals run aout too far .
they sewed him up in a <unk> , his head an ' feet <unk> ' , fer the rest o ' the trip , an ' now he 's to home in essex playin ' with little rag dolls . "
<name> choked with rage , but troop went on <unk> : " we 're sorry fer you .
we 're very sorry fer you  an ' so young .
we wo n't say no more abaout the money , i guess . "
" 'course you wo n't .
you stole it . "
" suit yourself .
we stole it ef it 's any comfort to you .
naow , abaout goin ' back .
<unk> ' we could do it , which we ca n't , you ai n't in no fit state to go back to your home , an ' we 've jest come on to the banks , workin ' fer our bread .
we do n't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a month , let alone <unk> ; an ' with good luck we 'll be ashore again somewheres abaout the first weeks o ' <name> . "
" but  but it 's may now , and i ca n't stay here doin ' nothing just because you want to fish .
i ca n't , i tell you ! "
" right an ' jest ; jest an ' right .
no one asks you to do nothin ' .
there's a heap as you can do , for <name> he went overboard on <name> have .
i mistrust he lost his grip in a <name> we <unk> there .
anyways , he never come back to deny it .
you 've turned up , plain , plumb providential for all concerned .
i mistrust , though , there 's ruther few things you kin do .
ai n't thet so ? "
" i can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore , " said <name> , with a vicious nod , murmuring vague threats about " piracy , " at which troop almost  not quite  smiled .
" excep ' talk .
i 'd forgot that .
you ai n't asked to talk more'n you 've a mind to aboard the " we 're here " .
keep your eyes open , an ' help <name> to do ez he 's bid , an ' <unk> , an ' i 'll give you  you ai n't wuth it , but i 'll give  ten an ' a ha'af a month ; say thirty-five at the end o ' the trip .
a little work <name> ease up your head , an ' you kin tell us all abaout your dad an ' your <name> n ' your money <unk> . "
" she 's on the steamer , " said <name> , his eyes <unk> tears .
" take me to new york at once . "
" poor woman  poor woman !
when she has you back she 'll forgit it all , though .
there 's eight of us on the " we 're here " , an ' ef we went back naow  it 's more'n a thousand mile  we 'd lose the season .
the men they would n't hev it , <unk> ' i was agreeable . "
" but my father would make it all right . "
" he 'd try .
i do n't doubt he 'd try , " said troop ; " but a whole <unk> catch is eight men 's bread ; an ' you 'll be better in your health when you see him in the fall .
go forward an ' help <name> .
it 's ten an ' a ha'af a month , ez i said , an ' , o ' course , all <unk> , same ez the rest o ' us . "
" do you mean i 'm to clean pots and pans and things ? "
said <name> .
" an ' other things .
you 've no call to shout , young feller . "
" i wo n't !
my father <name> give you enough to buy this dirty little <unk> "  <name> stamped on the deck  " ten times over , if you take me to new york safe ; and  and  you 're in a hundred and thirty by me , anyway . "
" <unk> ? "
said troop , the iron face darkening .
" how ?
you know how , well enough .
on top of all that , you want me to do menial work "  <name> was very proud of that adjective  " till the fall .
i tell you i <name> not .
you hear ? "
troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while , as <name> <unk> fiercely all around him .
" hsh ! "
he said at last .
" i 'm <unk> ' out my responsibilities in my own mind .
it 's a matter o ' <unk> . "
<name> stole up and plucked <name> by the elbow .
" do n't go to <unk> with dad any more , " he pleaded .
" you 've called him a thief two or three times over , an ' he do n't take that from any livin ' bein ' . "
" i wo n't ! "
<name> almost shrieked , disregarding the advice ; and still troop meditated .
" seems kinder <unk> , " he said at last , his eye travelling down to <name> .
" i do n't blame you , not a mite , young feller , nor you won't blame me when the <unk> 's out o ' your <unk> .
'be sure you sense what i say ?
ten an ' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner  an ' all <unk>  fer to teach you an ' fer the sake o ' your health .
yes or no ? "
" no ! "
said <name> .
" take me back to new york or i 'll see you  " he did not exactly remember what followed .
he was lying in the scuppers , holding on to a nose that bled , while troop looked down on him serenely .
" <name> , " he said to his son , " i was sot ag'in ' this young feller when i first saw him , on account o ' hasty <unk> .
never you be led astray by hasty <unk> , <name> .
naow i 'm sorry for him , because he 's clear distracted in his upper works .
he ai n't responsible fer the names he's give me , nor fer his other statements nor fer <unk> ' overboard , which i 'm abaout ha'af convinced he did .
you be gentle with him , <name> , <unk> i'll give you twice what i 've give him .
them <unk> clears the head .
let him sluice it off ! "
troop went down solemnly into the cabin , where he and the older men <unk> , leaving <name> to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions .
chapter ii " i warned ye , " said <name> , as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark , oiled planking .
" dad ai n't <unk> hasty , but you fair earned it .
pshaw !
there 's no sense takin ' on so . "
<name> 's shoulders were rising and falling in spasms of dry sobbing .
" i know the feelin ' .
first time dad laid me out was the last  and that was my first trip .
makes ye feel <unk> an ' lonesome .
i know . "
" it does , " moaned <name> .
" that man 's either crazy or drunk , and  and i ca n't do anything . "
" do n't say that to dad , " whispered <name> .
" he 's set ag'in ' all liquor , an '  well , he told me you was the madman .
what in creation made you call him a thief ?
he 's my dad . "
<name> sat up , mopped his nose , and told the story of the missing wad of bills .
" i 'm not crazy , " he wound up .
" only  your father has never seen more than a five-dollar <name> at a time , and my father could buy up this boat once a week and never miss it . "
" you do n't know what the " we 're here 's " worth .
your dad must hey a pile o ' money .
how did he git it ?
dad sez <unk> ca n't shake out a straight yarn .
go ahead . "
" in <unk> and things , west . "
" i 've read o ' that kind o ' business .
out west , too ?
does he go around with a pistol on a <unk> , same ez the circus ?
they call that the wild west , and i 've heard that their spurs an ' bridles was solid silver . "
" you are a chump ! "
said <name> , amused in spite of himself .
" my father has n't any use for ponies .
when he wants to ride he takes his car . "
" haow ?
<unk> ? "
" no .
his own private car , of course .
you 've seen a private car some time in your life ? "
" <unk> <unk> he hez one , " said <name> , cautiously .
" i saw her at the union depot in boston , with three niggers <unk> ' her run . "
( <name> meant cleaning the windows . )
" but <unk> <unk> he owns <unk> every railroad on long island , they say ; an ' they say he 's bought <unk> ha'af noo hampshire an ' run a <unk> around her , an ' filled her up with lions an ' tigers an ' bears an ' buffalo an ' crocodiles an ' such all .
<unk> <unk> he 's a millionaire .
i 've seen his car .
yes ? "
" well , my father 's what they call a <unk> ; and he has two private cars .
one 's named for me , the <unk> , ' and one for my mother , the <unk> . ' "
" hold on , " said <name> .
" dad do n't ever let me swear , but i guess you can .
'fore we go ahead , i want you to say <name> you may die if you 're lying . "
" of course , " said <name> .
" thet ai n't <unk> .
say , <unk> i may die if i ai n't speakin ' truth . ' "
" <name> i may die right here , " said <name> , " if every word i 've spoken is n't the cold truth . "
" hundred an ' thirty-four dollars an ' all ? "
said <name> .
" i heard ye talkin ' to dad , an ' i ha'af looked you 'd be <unk> up , same 's <name> . "
<name> protested himself red in the face .
<name> was a shrewd young person along his own lines , and ten minutes ' questioning convinced him that <name> was not lying  much .
besides , he had bound himself by the most terrible oath known to boyhood , and yet he sat , alive , with a <unk> nose , in the scuppers , <unk> marvels upon marvels .
" gosh ! "
said <name> at last , from the very bottom of his soul , when <name> had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour .
then a grin of mischievous delight overspread his broad face .
" i believe you , <name> .
dad 's made a mistake fer once in his life . "
" he has , sure , " said <name> , who was meditating an early revenge .
" he 'll be mad clear through .
dad jest hates to be mistook in his <unk> . "
<name> lay back and slapped his thigh .
" oh , <name> , do n't you <unk> the catch by <unk> ' on . "
" i do n't want to be knocked down again .
i 'll get even with him , though . "
" never heard any man ever got even with dad .
but he 'd knock ye down again sure .
the more he was mistook the more he 'd do it .
but <unk> and pistols  " " i never said a word about pistols , " <name> cut in , for he was on his oath .
" thet 's so ; no more you did .
two private cars , then , one named fer you an ' one fer her ; an ' two hundred dollars a month <unk> , all knocked into the scuppers fer not workin ' fer ten an ' a ha'af a month !
it 's the top haul o ' the season . "
he exploded with noiseless chuckles .
" then i was right ?
" said <name> , who thought he had found a <unk> .
" you was wrong ; the <unk> kind o ' wrong !
you take right hold an' pitch in <unk> o ' me , or you 'll catch it , an ' i 'll catch it fer <unk> ' you up .
dad always gives me double helps 'cause i 'm his son , an ' he hates <unk> ' folk .
'guess you 're kinder mad at dad .
i 've been that way time an ' again .
but dad 's a mighty jest man ; all the fleet says so . "
" looks like justice , this , do n't it ? "
<name> pointed to his outraged nose .
" thet 's nothin ' .
lets the shore blood outer you .
dad did it for <name> health .
say , though , i ca n't have <unk> 's with a man that thinks me or dad or any one on the " we 're here 's " a thief .
we ai n't any common <unk> crowd by any manner o ' means .
we 're fishermen , an ' we've shipped together for six years an ' more .
do n't you make any mistake on that !
i told ye dad do n't let me swear .
he calls 'em vain oaths , and pounds me ; but ef i could say what you said <unk> your pap an ' his <unk> 's , i 'd say that <unk> your dollars .
i dunno what was in your pockets when i dried your <name> , fer i did n't look to see ; but i 'd say , using the very same words ez you used jest now , neither me nor dad  an' we was the only two that <unk> you after you was brought aboard  knows anythin ' <unk> the money .
thet 's my say .
naow ? "
the <unk> had certainly cleared <name> 's <name> , and maybe the loneliness of the sea had something to do with it .
" that 's all right , " he said .
then he looked down confusedly .
" 'seems to me that for a fellow just saved from drowning i have n't been over and above grateful , <name> . "
" well , you was shook up and silly , " said <name> .
" anyway , there was only dad an ' me aboard to see it .
the cook he do n't count . "
" i might have thought about losing the bills that way , " <name> said , half to himself , " instead of calling everybody in sight a thief <unk> your father ? "
" in the cabin what d ' you want o ' him again ? "
" you 'll see , " said <name> , and he stepped , rather <unk> , for his head was still singing , to the cabin steps , where the little ship's clock <name> in plain sight of the wheel .
troop , in the <unk> painted cabin , was busy with a note-book and an enormous black pencil , which he sucked hard from time to time " i have n't acted quite right , " said <name> , surprised at his own meekness .
" what 's wrong naow ? "
said the skipper " walked into <name> , hev ye ? "
" no ; it 's about you . "
" i 'm here to listen . "
" well , i  i 'm here to take things back , " said <name> , very quickly .
" when a man 's saved from drowning  " he gulped .
" <unk> ?
you 'll make a man yet ef you go on this way . "
" he ought n't begin by calling people names . "
" jest an ' right  right an ' jest , " said troop , with the ghost of a dry smile .
" so i 'm here to say i 'm sorry . "
another big gulp .
troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held out an <unk> hand .
" i mistrusted 'twould do you sights o ' good ; an ' this shows i were n't mistook in my <unk> . "
a smothered chuckle on deck caught his ear .
" i am very seldom mistook in my <unk> . "
the <unk> hand closed on <name> 's , <unk> it to the elbow .
" we'll put a little more <unk> to that 'fore we 've done with you , young feller ; an ' i do n't think any worse of ye fer anythin ' thet 's gone by .
you was n't fairly responsible .
go right abaout your business an ' you wo n't take no hurt . "
" you 're white , " said <name> , as <name> regained the deck , flushed to the tips of his ears .
" i do n't feel it , " said he .
" i did n't mean that way .
i heard what dad said .
when dad allows he do n't think the worse of any man , dad 's give himself away .
he hates to be mistook in his <unk> , too .
ho !
ho !
onct dad has a <unk> , he'd sooner dip his colours to the british than change it .
i 'm glad it's settled right <unk> up .
dad 's right when he says he ca n't take you back .
it 's all the livin ' we make here  <unk> ' .
the men 'll be back like sharks after a dead whale in ha'af an hour . "
" what for ? "
said <name> .
" supper , o ' course .
do n't your stummick tell you ?
you 've a heap to learn . "
" 'guess i have , " said <name> , dolefully , looking at the tangle of ropes and blocks overhead .
" she 's a <name> , " said <name> , enthusiastically , misunderstanding the look .
" wait till our mainsail 's bent , an ' she walks home with all her salt wet .
there 's some work first , though . "
he pointed down into the darkness of the open <unk> between the two masts .
" what 's that for ?
it 's all empty , " said <name> .
" you an ' me an ' a few more hev got to fill it , " said <name> .
" that 's where the fish goes . "
" alive ? "
said <name> .
" well , no .
they 're so 's to be ruther dead  an ' flat  an ' salt .
there's a hundred hogshead o ' salt in the <unk> ; an ' we <name> n't more'n covered our <unk> to now . "
" where are the fish , though ? "
" 'in the sea , they say ; in the boats , we pray , ' " said <name> , quoting a fisherman 's proverb .
" you come in last night with <unk> forty of 'em . "
he pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck .
" you an ' me we 'll sluice that out when they 're through .
<unk> we 'll hev full pens to-night !
i 've seen her down ha'af a foot with fish <unk> to clean , an ' we stood to the tables till we was <unk> ' ourselves instid o ' them , we was so sleepy .
yes , they 're comin ' in naow . "
<name> looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them over the shining , silky sea .
" i 've never seen the sea from so low down , " said <name> .
" it 's fine . "
the low sun made the water all purple and pinkish , with golden lights on the barrels of the long swells , and blue and green mackerel shades in the hollows .
each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories towards her by invisible strings , and the little black figures in the <name> boats pulled like clockwork toys .
" they 've struck on good , " said <name> , between his half-shut eyes .
" <name> <name> n't room fer another fish .
low ez a <unk> in still water , ain't he ? "
" which is <name> ?
i do n't see how you can tell 'em 'way off , as you do . "
" last boat to the <unk> .
he <unk> you last night , " said <name> , pointing .
" <name> rows <unk> ; ye ca n't mistake him .
east o' him  he 's a heap better'n he rows  is pennsylvania .
loaded with <unk> , by the looks of him .
east o ' him  see how pretty they string out all along with the <unk> shoulders , is long <name> .
he 's a galway man <unk> ' south boston , where they all live mostly , an ' mostly them galway men are good in a boat .
north , away yonder  you 'll hear him tune up in a minute  is <name> platt .
man-o'-war 's man he was on the old ohio  first of our navy , he says , to go araound the horn .
he never talks of much else , <unk> when he sings , but be has fair <unk> ' luck .
there !
what did i tell you ? "
a melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory .
<name> heard something about somebody 's hands and feet being cold , and then : " bring forth the chart , the doleful chart ; see where them <unk> meet !
the clouds are thick around their heads , the mists around their feet . "
" full boat , " said <name> , with a chuckle .
" if he gives us 'o captain ' it's <unk> ' full . "
the bellow continued : " and naow to thee , o <unk> , most earnestly i pray that they shall never bury me in church or <unk> grey . "
" double game for <name> platt .
he 'll tell you all about the old ohio to-morrow .
'see that blue dory behind him ?
he 's my uncle ,  dad 's own brother ,  an ' ef there 's any bad luck loose on the banks she 'll fetch up ag'in ' uncle salters , sure .
look how tender he 's <unk> ' .
i 'll lay my wage and share he 's the only man stung up to-day  an ' he 's stung up good . "
" what 'll sting him ? "
said <name> , getting interested .
" strawberries , mostly .
<unk> , sometimes , an ' sometimes lemons an' <unk> .
yes , he 's stung up from his elbows down .
that man 's <unk> perfectly <unk> ' .
naow we 'll take <unk> o ' the <unk> an ' <unk> 'em in .
is it true , what you told me jest now , that you never done a hand 's turn o ' work in all your born life ?
must feel kinder awful , do n't it ? "
" i 'm going to try to work , anyway , " <name> replied stoutly .
" only it's all dead new . "
" lay <unk> o ' that tackle , then .
behind ye ! "
<name> grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the stays of the mainmast , while <name> pulled down another that ran from something he called a " <unk> , " as <name> <name> alongside in his loaded dory .
the portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that <name> learned to know well later , and a <unk> fork began to throw fish into the pen on deck .
" two hundred and thirty-one , " he shouted .
" give him the hook , " said <name> , and <name> ran it into <name> 's hands .
he slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory 's bow , caught <unk> tackle , hooked it to the <unk> , and clambered into the schooner .
" pull ! "
shouted <name> ; and <name> pulled , astonished to find how easily the dory rose .
" hold on ; she do n't nest in the <unk> ! "
<name> laughed ; and <name> held on , for the boat lay in the air above his head .
" lower away , " <name> shouted ; and as <name> lowered , <name> swayed the light boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast .
" they do n't weigh nothin ' empty .
thet was right smart fer a passenger .
there 's more trick to it in a <unk> . "
" ah <name> ! "
said <name> , holding out a brown hand .
" you are some pretty well now ?
this time last night the fish they fish for you .
now you fish for fish .
eh , wha-at ? "
" i 'm  i 'm ever so grateful , " <name> stammered , and his unfortunate hand stole to his pocket once more , but he remembered that he had no money to offer .
when he knew <name> better the mere thought of the mistake he might have made would cover him with hot , uneasy blushes in his bunk .
" there is no to be thankful for to me ! "
said <name> .
" how shall i leave you <unk> , <unk> all around the banks ?
now you are a fisherman eh , wha-at ?
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
he bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips to get the <unk> out of himself .
" i have not cleaned boat to-day .
too busy .
they struck on <unk> .
<name> , my son , clean for me . "
<name> moved forward at once .
here was something he could do for the man who had saved his life .
<name> threw him a swab , and he leaned over the dory , mopping up the slime clumsily , but with great good-will .
" hike out the <unk> ; they slide in them grooves , " said <name> .
" swab 'em an ' lay 'em down .
never let a <unk> jam .
ye may want her bad some day .
here 's long <name> . "
a stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside .
" <name> , you take the tackle .
i 'll fix the tables .
<name> , clear <name> 's boat .
long <name> 's <unk> ' on the top of her . "
<name> looked up from his <unk> at the bottom of another dory just above his head .
" jest like the injian <unk> , ai n't they ? "
said <name> , as the one boat dropped into the other .
" takes to ut like a duck to water , " said long <name> , a <unk> , <unk> galway man , bending to and fro exactly as <name> had done .
disko in the cabin growled up the hatchway , and they could hear him suck his pencil .
" <name> hunder an ' forty-nine an ' a half  bad luck to ye , <unk> ! "
said long <name> .
" i 'm <unk> ' meself to fill your <unk> .
slate ut for a bad catch .
the <unk> has bate me . "
whack came another dory alongside , and more fish shot into the pen .
" two hundred and three .
let 's look at the passenger ! "
the speaker was even larger than the galway man , and his face was made curious by a purple cut running <unk> from his left eye to the right corner of his mouth .
not knowing what else to do , <name> <unk> each dory as it came down , pulled out the <unk> , and laid them in the bottom of the boat .
" he 's caught on good , " said the scarred man , who was <name> platt , watching him critically .
" there are two ways o ' doin ' everything .
one's <unk>  any end first an ' a slippery hitch over all  an ' the other 's  " " what we did on the old ohio ! "
<name> interrupted , brushing into the knot of men with a long board on legs .
" git out o ' here , <name> platt , an' leave me fix the tables . "
he jammed one end of the board into two <unk> in the bulwarks , kicked out the leg , and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the man-o'-war 's man .
" an ' they did that on the ohio , too , <name> .
see ? "
said <name> platt , laughing .
" 'guess they was <unk> , then , fer it did n't git home , and i know who 'll find his boots on the <unk> ef he do n't leave us alone .
haul ahead !
i 'm busy , ca n't ye see ? "
" <name> , ye lie on the cable an ' sleep all day , " said long <name> .
" you're the <unk> av <unk> , an ' i 'm persuaded ye 'll corrupt our supercargo in a week . "
" his name 's <name> , " said <name> , waving two strangely shaped knives , " an' he 'll be worth five of any sou ' boston <unk> 'fore long . "
he laid the knives tastefully on the table , cocked his head on one side , and admired the effect .
" i think it 's forty-two , " said a small voice <unk> , and there was a roar of laughter as another voice answered , " then my luck 's turned fer onct , <unk> i 'm forty-five , though i be stung outer all shape . "
" forty-two or forty-five .
i 've lost count , " the small voice said .
" it 's penn an ' uncle salters <unk> ' catch .
this beats the circus any day , " said <name> .
" jest look at 'em ! "
" come in  come in ! "
roared long <name> .
" it 's wet out <unk> , children . "
" forty-two , ye said . "
this was uncle salters .
" i 'll count again , then , " the voice replied meekly .
the two dories swung together and <unk> into the schooner 's side .
" <name> o ' jerusalem ! "
snapped uncle salters , backing water with a splash .
" what <unk> a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me .
you 've nigh stove me all up . "
" i am sorry , mr. salters .
i came to sea on account of nervous <unk> .
you advised me , i think . "
" you an ' your <unk> <unk> be drowned in the <unk> , " roared uncle salters , a fat and <unk> little man .
" you 're comin ' down on me ag'in .
did ye say forty-two or forty-five ? "
" i 've forgotten , mr. salters .
let 's count . "
" do n't see as it could be forty-five .
i 'm forty-five , " said uncle salters .
" you count <unk> , penn . "
disko troop came out of the cabin .
" salters , you pitch your fish in naow at once , " he said in the tone of authority .
" do n't <unk> the catch , dad , " <name> murmured .
" them two are on'y jest beginnin ' . "
" mother av delight !
he 's <unk> ' them <name> by <name> , " howled long <name> , as uncle salters got to work laboriously ; the little man in the other dory counting a line of notches on the gunwale .
" that was last week 's catch , " he said , looking up plaintively , his forefinger where he had left off .
<name> nudged <name> , who darted to the <unk> , and , leaning far overside , slipped the hook into the <unk> as <name> made her fast forward .
the others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in  man , fish , and all .
" one , two , four  nine , " said <name> platt , counting with a practised eye .
" forty-seven .
penn , you 're it ! "
<name> let the <unk> run , and slid him out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish .
" hold on ! "
roared uncle salters , bobbing by the waist .
" hold on , i 'm a bit mixed in my <unk> . "
he had no time to protest , but was hove <unk> and treated like " pennsylvania . "
" forty-one , " said <name> platt .
" beat by a farmer , salters .
an ' you sech a sailor , too ! "
" 'twere n't fair <unk> , " said he , stumbling out of the pen ; " an ' i'm stung up all to pieces . "
his thick hands were puffy and mottled <unk> white .
" some folks <name> find <unk> , " said <name> , addressing the newly risen moon , " ef they hev to dive fer it , seems to me . "
" an ' others , " said uncle salters , " eats the fat o ' the land in sloth , an ' mocks their own <unk> . "
" seat ye !
seat ye ! "
a voice <name> had not heard called from the fo'c'sle .
disko troop , <name> platt , long <name> , and salters went forward on the word .
little penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the tangled <unk> ; <name> lay down full length on the deck , and <name> dropped into the hold , where <name> heard him banging casks with a hammer .
" salt , " he said , returning .
" soon as we 're through supper we git to <unk> .
you 'll pitch to dad .
<name> platt an ' dad they stow together , an ' you 'll hear 'em <unk> ' .
we 're second ha'af , you an ' me an ' <name> an ' penn  the youth an ' beauty o ' the boat . "
" what 's the good of that ? "
said <name> .
" i 'm hungry . "
" they 'll be through in a minute .
sniff !
she smells good to-night .
dad ships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother .
it 's a full catch today , ai n't it ? "
he pointed at the pens piled high with cod .
" what water did ye hev , <name> ? "
" <unk> father , " said the portuguese , sleepily .
" they strike on good an ' <unk> .
some day i show you , <name> . "
the moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men came aft .
the cook had no need to cry " second half . "
<name> and <name> were down the hatch and at table ere <name> platt , last and most deliberate of the elders , had finished wiping his mouth with the back of his hand .
<name> followed penn , and sat down before a tin pan of cod 's tongues and sounds , mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato , a loaf of hot bread , and some black and powerful coffee .
hungry as they were , they waited while " pennsylvania " solemnly asked a blessing .
then they <unk> in silence till <name> <name> breath over his tin cup and demanded of <name> how he felt .
" 'most full , but there 's just room for another piece . "
the cook was a huge , <unk> negro , and , unlike all the negroes <name> had met , did not talk , contenting himself with smiles and <unk> invitations to eat more .
" see , <name> , " said <name> , rapping with his fork on the table , " it 's jest as i said .
the young an ' handsome men  like me an ' <unk> an ' you an' <name>  we 're second ha'af , an ' we eats when the first ha'af are through .
they 're the old fish ; and they 're mean an ' <unk> , an ' their <unk> has to be <unk> ; so they come first , which they don't deserve .
ai n't that so , doctor ? "
the cook nodded .
" ca n't he talk ? "
said <name> , in a whisper .
" 'nough to git along .
not much o ' anything we know .
his natural tongue 's kinder curious .
comes from the <unk> of cape <unk> , he does , where the farmers speak home-made scotch .
cape <unk> 's full o' niggers whose folk run in there <unk> ' <unk> war , an ' they talk like the farmers  all <unk> . "
" that is not scotch , " said " pennsylvania . "
" that is <unk> .
so i read in a book . "
" penn reads a heap .
most of what he says is so  <unk> ' when it comes to a <unk> o ' fish  eh ? "
" does your father just let them say how many they 've caught without checking them ? "
said <name> .
" why , yes .
where 's the sense of a man lyin ' fer a few old cod ? "
" was a man once lied for his catch , " <name> put in .
" lied every day .
fife , ten , <unk> more fish than come he say there was . "
" where was that ? "
said <name> .
" none o ' <unk> folk . "
" frenchman of <unk> . "
" ah !
them west shore frenchmen do n't <unk> , anyway .
stands to reason they ca n't <unk> .
ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks , <name> , you 'll know why , " said <name> , with an awful contempt .
" always more and never less , every time we come to dress , " long <name> roared down the hatch , and the " second ha'af " scrambled up at once .
the shadow of the masts and rigging , with the <unk> <unk> , rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight ; and the pile of fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver .
in the hold there were <unk> and <unk> where disko troop and <name> platt moved among the <unk> .
<name> passed <name> a pitchfork , and led him to the <unk> end of the rough table , where uncle salters was drumming impatiently with a <unk> .
a tub of salt water lay at his feet .
" you pitch to dad an ' <name> platt down the hatch , an ' take <unk> uncle salters do n't cut <name> eye out , " said <name> , swinging himself into the hold .
" i 'll pass salt below . "
penn and <name> stood knee-deep among cod in the pen , flourishing drawn knives .
long <name> , a basket at his feet and <unk> on his hands , faced uncle salters at the table , and <name> stared at the pitchfork and the tub .
" hi ! "
shouted <name> , stooping to the fish , and bringing one up with a finger under its gill and a finger in its eye .
he laid it on the edge of the pen ; the <unk> glimmered with a sound of tearing , and the fish , slit from throat to vent , with a <name> on either side of the neck , dropped at long <name> 's feet .
" hi ! "
said long <name> , with a scoop of his <unk> hand .
the <unk> liver dropped in the basket .
another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying , and the empty fish slid across to uncle salters , who snorted fiercely .
there was another sound of tearing , the backbone flew over the bulwarks , and the fish , headless , <unk> , and open , splashed in the tub , sending the salt water into <name> 's astonished mouth .
after the first yell , the men were silent .
the cod moved along as though they were alive , and long ere <name> had ceased wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all , his tub was full .
" pitch ! "
grunted uncle salters , without turning his head , and <name> pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch .
" hi !
pitch 'em <unk> , " shouted <name> .
" do n't scatter !
uncle salters is the best <unk> in the fleet .
watch him mind his book ! "
indeed , it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting magazine pages against time .
<name> 's body , cramped over from the hips , stayed like a statue ; but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing .
little penn toiled valiantly , but it was easy to see he was weak .
once or twice <name> found time to help him without breaking the chain of supplies , and once <name> howled because he had caught his finger in a frenchman 's hook .
these hooks are made of soft metal , to be <unk> after use ; but the cod very often get away with them and are hooked again elsewhere ; and that is one of the many reasons why the gloucester boats despise the frenchmen .
down below , the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh sounded like the whirring of a grindstone  a steady <unk> to the " <unk> " of the knives in the pen ; the wrench and <unk> of torn heads , dropped liver , and flying offal ; the " <unk> " of uncle salters 's knife <unk> away <unk> ; and the flap of wet , opened bodies falling into the tub .
at the end of an hour <name> would have given the world to rest ; for fresh , wet cod weigh more than you would think , and his back ached with the steady pitching .
but he felt for the first time in his life that he was one of a working gang of men , took pride in the thought , and held on sullenly .
" knife oh ! "
shouted uncle salters , at last .
penn doubled up , gasping among the fish , <name> bowed back and forth to supple himself , and long <name> leaned over the bulwarks .
the cook appeared , noiseless as a black shadow , collected a mass of <unk> and heads , and retreated .
" <unk> for breakfast an ' <unk> , " said long <name> , smacking his lips .
" knife oh ! "
repeated uncle salters , waving the flat , curved <unk> weapon .
" look by your foot , harve , " cried <name> , below .
<name> saw half a dozen knives stuck in a <unk> in the hatch <unk> .
he dealt these around , taking over the dulled ones .
" water ! "
said disko troop .
" <unk> 's <unk> , an ' the dipper 's alongside .
hurry , harve , " said <name> .
he was back in a minute with a big <unk> of stale brown water which tasted like nectar , and loosed the jaws of disko and <name> platt .
" these are cod , " said disko .
" they ai n't <unk> figs , <name> platt , nor yet silver bars .
i 've told you that every single time sence we've sailed together . "
" a matter o ' seven seasons , " returned <name> platt , coolly .
" good <unk> good <unk> ' all the same , an ' there 's a right an ' a wrong way o' <unk> ' ballast even .
if you 'd ever seen four hundred ton o ' iron set into the  " " hi ! "
with a yell from <name> the work began again , and never stopped till the pen was empty .
the instant the last fish was down , disko troop rolled aft to the cabin with his brother ; <name> and long <name> went forward ; <name> platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere he too disappeared .
in half a minute <name> heard deep snores in the cabin , and he was staring blankly at <name> and penn .
" i did a little better that time , <name> , " said penn , whose eyelids were heavy with sleep .
" but i think it is my duty to help clean . "
" 'would n't hev your conscience fer a thousand <unk> , " said <name> .
" turn in , penn .
you 've no call to do boy 's work .
draw a bucket , <name> .
oh , penn , dump these in the <unk> 'fore you sleep .
kin you keep awake that long ? "
penn took up the heavy basket of <unk> , emptied them into a cask with a <unk> top lashed by the fo'c'sle ; then he too dropped out of sight in the cabin .
" boys clean up after <unk> ' down , an ' first watch in <unk> weather is boy 's watch on the 'we 're here ' . "
<name> sluiced the pen energetically , <unk> the table , set it up to dry in the moonlight , ran the red <unk> through a wad of oakum , and began to sharpen them on a <name> grindstone , as <name> threw offal and <unk> overboard under his direction .
at the first splash a <unk> ghost rose bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh .
<name> started back with a shout , but <name> only laughed .
" grampus , " said he .
" <unk> ' fer <unk> .
they <unk> thet way when they 're hungry .
breath on him like the doleful tombs , <name> n't he ? "
a horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white sank , and the water bubbled <unk> .
" <name> n't ye never seen a grampus <unk> before ?
you 'll see 'em by hundreds 'fore ye 're through .
say , it 's good to hev a boy aboard again .
<name> was too old , an ' a dutchy at that .
him an ' me we fought <unk> .
'would n't <name> ' <unk> fer thet ef he 'd hed a <name> tongue in his head .
sleepy ? "
" dead sleepy , " said <name> , nodding forward .
" 'must n't sleep on watch .
rouse up an ' see ef our <unk> 's bright an ' <unk> ' .
you 're on watch now , harve . "
" pshaw !
what 's to hurt us ?
bright 's day .
<unk> !
" jest when things happen , dad says .
fine weather 's good <unk> ' , an' 'fore you know , mebbe , you 're cut in two by a liner , an ' seventeen <unk> officers , all <unk> , lift their hand to it that your lights was aout an ' there was a thick fog .
harve , i 've kinder took to you , but ef you nod onct more i 'll lay into you with a rope 's end . "
the moon , who sees many strange things on the banks , looked down on a slim youth in <unk> and a red jersey , staggering around the <unk> decks of a <unk> schooner , while behind him , waving a knotted rope , walked , after the manner of an executioner , a boy who yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt .
the lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly , the <unk> <unk> a little in the shifts of the light wind , the windlass creaked , and the miserable procession continued .
<name> expostulated , threatened , whimpered , and at last wept outright , while <name> , the words <unk> on his tongue , spoke of the beauty of watchfulness , and slashed away with the rope 's end , punishing the dories as often as he hit <name> .
at last the clock in the cabin struck ten , and upon the tenth stroke little penn crept on deck .
he found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side on the <unk> , so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to their berths .
chapter iii it was the <unk> slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart , and sends you to breakfast <unk> .
they emptied a big tin dish of juicy fragments of fish  the <unk> the cook had collected overnight .
they cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess , who were out fishing , sliced pork for the midday meal , <unk> down the fo'c'sle , filled the lamps , <name> coal and water for the cook , and investigated the <unk> , where the boat 's stores were stacked .
it was another perfect day  soft , mild , and clear ; and <name> breathed to the very bottom of his lungs .
more schooners had crept up in the night , and the long blue seas were full of sails and dories .
far away on the horizon , the smoke of some liner , her hull invisible , <unk> the blue , and to eastward a big ship 's <unk> , just lifting , made a square <name> in it .
disko troop was smoking by the roof of the cabin  one eye on the craft around , and the other on the little fly at the <unk> .
" when dad <unk> that way , " said <name> , in a whisper , " he 's <unk> some <unk> thinkin ' fer all hands .
i 'll lay my wage an ' share we'll make berth soon .
dad he knows the cod , an ' the fleet they know dad knows .
'see 'em comin ' up one by one , lookin ' fer nothin ' in particular , o ' course , but <unk> ' on us all the time ?
there 's the <name> <unk> ; she 's a <unk> boat .
she 's <unk> ' up sence last night .
an ' see that big one with a patch in her foresail an ' a new jib ?
she's the <name> pitman from west chatham .
she wo n't keep her canvas long on less her luck 's changed since last season .
she do n't do much <unk> drift .
there ai n't an anchor made 'll hold her .
.
.
.
when the smoke puffs up in little rings like that , dad 's <unk> ' the fish .
ef we speak to him now , he 'll git mad .
las ' time i did , he jest took an ' hove a boot at me . "
disko troop stared forward , the pipe between his teeth , with eyes that saw nothing .
as his son said , he was studying the fish  <unk> his knowledge and experience on the banks against the roving cod in his own sea .
he accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the horizon as a compliment to his powers .
but now that it was paid , he wished to draw away and make his berth alone , till it was time to go up to the virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the waters .
so disko troop thought of recent weather , and gales , currents , <unk> , and other domestic arrangements , from the point of view of a <unk> cod ; was , in fact , for an hour a cod himself , and looked remarkably like one .
then he removed the pipe from his teeth .
" dad , " said <name> , " we 've done our <unk> .
ca n't we go overside a piece ?
it 's good <unk> ' weather . "
" not in that <unk> rig ner them <unk> brown shoes .
give him <unk> ' fit to wear . "
" dad 's pleased  that settles it , " said <name> , delightedly , dragging <name> into the cabin , while troop pitched a key down the steps .
" dad keeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it , 'cause <name> sez i'm <unk> . "
he rummaged through a locker , and in less than three minutes <name> was adorned with fisherman 's rubber boots that came half up his thigh , a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows , a pair of flippers , and a <unk> .
" naow ye look somethin ' like , " said <name> .
" hurry ! "
" keep nigh an ' handy , " said troop , " an ' do n't go <unk> ' <unk> the fleet .
ef any one asks you what i 'm <unk> ' to do , speak the truth  fer ye do n't know . "
a little red dory , labelled <name> s. , lay astern of the schooner .
<name> hauled in the painter , and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards , while <name> tumbled clumsily after .
" that 's no way o ' gettin ' into a boat , " said <name> .
" ef there was any sea you 'd go to the bottom , sure .
you got to learn to meet her . "
<name> fitted the <unk> , took the forward thwart , and watched <name> 's work .
the boy had rowed , in a <unk> fashion , on the <unk> ponds ; but there is a difference between squeaking pins and <unk> <unk>  light <unk> and stubby , <unk> <unk> .
they stuck in the gentle swell , and <name> grunted .
" short !
row short ! "
said <name> .
" ef you cramp your oar in any kind o ' sea you 're liable to turn her over .
ai n't she a <name> ?
mine , too . "
the little dory was <unk> clean .
in her bows lay a <name> anchor , two <unk> of water , and some seventy fathoms of thin , brown <unk> .
a tin <unk> rested in <unk> just under <name> 's right hand , beside an <unk> <unk> , a short <unk> , and a shorter wooden stick .
a couple of lines , with very heavy leads and double <unk> , all neatly coiled on square reels , were stuck in their place by the gunwale .
" where 's the sail and mast ? "
said <name> , for his hands were beginning to blister .
<name> chuckled .
" ye do n't sail <unk> much .
ye pull ; but ye need n't pull so hard .
do n't you wish you owned her ? "
" well , i guess my father might give me one or two if i asked 'em , " <name> replied .
he had been too busy to think much of his family till then .
" that 's so .
i forgot your dad 's a millionaire .
you do n't act <unk> any , naow .
but a dory an ' craft an ' gear "  <name> spoke as though she were a <unk> " costs a heap .
think your dad <unk> 'd give you one fer  fer a pet like ? "
" should n't wonder .
it would be 'most the only thing i have n't stuck him for yet . "
" must be an expensive kinder kid to home .
do n't <unk> thet way , harve .
short 's the trick , because no sea 's ever dead still , an ' the swells 'll  " crack !
the loom of the oar kicked <name> under the <name> and knocked him backward .
" that was what i was goin ' to say .
i hed to learn too , but i wasn't more than eight years old when i got my <unk> ' . "
<name> regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown .
" no good gettin ' mad at things , dad says .
it 's our own fault ef we ca n't handle 'em , he says .
<name> 's try here .
<name> 'll give us the water . "
the " <unk> " was rocking fully a mile away , but when <name> <unk> an oar he waved his left arm three times .
" thirty fathom , " said <name> , stringing a salt clam on to the hook .
" over with the <unk> .
bait same 's i do , harve , an ' do n't snarl your reel . "
<name> 's line was out long before <name> had mastered the mystery of <unk> and heaving out the leads .
the dory drifted along easily .
it was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground .
" here we come ! "
<name> shouted , and a shower of spray rattled on <unk> shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside .
" <unk> , <name> , <unk> !
under your hand !
quick ! "
evidently " <unk> " could not be the <unk> , so <name> passed over the <unk> , and <name> scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it <unk> , and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he called a " <unk> . "
then <name> felt a tug , and pulled up zealously .
" why , these are strawberries ! "
he shouted .
" look ! "
the hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries , red on one side and white on the other  perfect <unk> of the land fruit , except that there were no leaves , and the stem was all <unk> and slimy .
" do n't tech 'em !
<unk> 'em off .
do n't  " the warning came too late .
<name> had picked them from the hook , and was admiring them .
" ouch ! "
he cried , for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped many <unk> .
" naow ye know what <unk> means .
nothin ' <unk> ' fish should be <unk> with the naked fingers , dad says .
<unk> 'em off ag'in ' the gunnel , an ' bait up , harve .
lookin ' wo n't help any .
it 's all in the wages . "
<name> smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month , and wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over the edge of a <unk> in <unk> .
she suffered agonies whenever he went out on <unk> lake ; and , by the way , <name> remembered distinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties .
suddenly the line flashed through his hand , stinging even through the " flippers , " the woolen <unk> supposed to protect it .
" he 's a <unk> .
give him room accordin ' to his strength , " cried <name> .
" i 'll help ye . "
" no , you wo n't , " <name> snapped , as he <name> on to the line .
" it 's my first fish .
is  is it a whale ? "
" <unk> , mebbe . "
<name> peered down into the water alongside , and flourished the big " <unk> , " ready for all chances .
something white and oval flickered and fluttered through the green .
" i 'll lay my wage an' share he 's over a hundred .
are you so everlastin ' anxious to land him alone ? "
<name> 's knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged against the gunwale ; his face was <unk> between excitement and exertion ; he dripped with sweat , and was half blinded from staring at the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line .
the boys were tired long ere the <unk> , who took charge of them and the dory for the next twenty minutes .
but the big flat fish was <unk> and hauled in at last .
" beginner 's luck , " said <name> , wiping his forehead .
" he 's all of a hundred . "
<name> looked at the huge <unk> creature with unspeakable pride .
he had seen <unk> many times on marble slabs ashore , but it had never occurred to him to ask how they came inland .
now he knew ; and every inch of his body ached with fatigue .
" ef dad was along , " said <name> , hauling up , " he 'd read the signs <unk> print .
the fish arc runnin ' smaller an ' smaller , an ' you 've took <unk> as <unk> a <unk> 's we 're apt to find this trip .
yesterday 's catch  did ye notice it ?  was all big fish an ' no <unk> .
dad he 'd read them signs right off .
dad says <unk> ' on the banks is signs , an ' can be read wrong er right .
dad 's <unk> the <unk> . "
even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the " we 're here " , and a <unk> was run up in the <unk> .
" what did i say , naow ?
that 's the call fer the whole crowd .
dad 's <unk> something , er he 'd never break <unk> ' this time o ' day .
reel up , harve , an ' we 'll pull back . "
they were to windward of the schooner , just ready to flirt the dory over the still sea , when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to penn , who was <unk> around a fixed point , for all the world like a gigantic <unk> .
the little man backed away and came down again with enormous energy , but at the end of each manoeuvre his dory swung round and snubbed herself on her rope .
" we 'll hey to help him , else he 'll root an ' seed here , " said <name> .
" what 's the matter ? "
said <name> .
this was a new world , where he could not lay down the law to his elders , but had to ask questions humbly .
and the sea was horribly big and <unk> .
" anchor 's fouled .
penn 's always losing 'em .
lost two this trip <unk> ,  on <name> bottom , too ,  an ' dad says next one he loses , <unk> <unk> ' , he 'll give him the <unk> .
that <unk> 'd break penn 's heart . "
" what 's a <unk> ' ? "
said <name> , who had a vague idea it might be some kind of <name> torture , like <unk> in the <unk> .
" big stone instid of an anchor .
you kin see a <unk> ridin ' in the bows fur 's you can see a dory , an ' all the fleet knows what it means .
they'd <name> him dreadful .
penn could n't stand that no more'n a dog with a dipper to his tail .
he 's so everlastin ' sensitive .
hello , penn !
stuck again ?
do n't try any more o ' your patents .
come up on her , and keep your <unk> ' straight up an ' down . "
" it does n't move , " said the little man , panting .
" it does n't move at all , and indeed i tried everything . "
" what 's all this <unk> <unk> ? "
said <name> , pointing to a wild tangle of spare oars and <unk> , all matted together by the hand of inexperience .
" oh , that , " said penn , proudly , " is a spanish windlass .
mr. salters showed me how to make it ; but even that does n't move her . "
<name> bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile , twitched once or twice on the <unk> , and , behold , the anchor <name> at once .
" haul up , penn , " he said , laughing , " er she 'll git stuck again . "
they left him regarding the <unk> <unk> of the little anchor with big , pathetic blue eyes , and thanking them profusely .
" oh , say , while i think of it , harve , " said <name> , when they were out of <unk> , " penn ai n't quite all <unk> .
he ai n't nowise dangerous , but his mind 's give out .
see ? "
" is that so , or is it one of your father 's judgments ? "
<name> asked , as he bent to his oars .
he felt he was learning to handle them more easily .
" dad ai n't mistook this time .
penn 's a <unk> <unk> .
no , he ain't thet , exactly , so much ez a harmless <unk> .
it was this way ( you're <unk> ' quite so , harve ) , an ' i tell you 'cause it 's right you <unk> know .
he was a <unk> preacher once .
<name> <unk> wuz his name , dad told me , an ' he lived with his wife an ' four children somewheres out pennsylvania way .
well , penn he took his folks along to a <unk> meetin ' ,  <unk> ' , most like ,  an ' they stayed over jest one night in <unk> .
you 've <unk> talk o ' <unk> ? "
<name> considered .
" yes , i have .
but i do n't know why .
it sticks in my head same as <unk> . "
" both was big accidents  thet 's why , harve .
well , that one single night penn and his folks was to the hotel <unk> was wiped out .
<unk> <unk> an ' flooded her , an ' the houses struck adrift an ' bumped into each other an ' sunk .
i 've seen the pictures , an ' they 're <unk> .
penn he saw his folk drowned all 'n a heap 'fore he rightly knew what was comin ' .
his mind give out from that on .
he mistrusted somethin ' hed happened up to <unk> , but for the poor life of him he couldn't remember what , an ' he jest drifted araound <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' .
he did n't know what he was , nor yit what he hed bin , an ' thet way he run ag'in ' uncle salters , who was <unk> ' 'n <unk> city .
ha'af my mother 's folks they live scattered inside o ' pennsylvania , an ' uncle salters he visits araound winters .
uncle salters he kinder adopted penn , well knowin ' what his trouble wuz ; an ' he brought him east , an' he give him work on his farm . "
" why , i heard him calling penn a farmer last night when the boats bumped .
is your uncle salters a farmer ? "
" farmer ! "
shouted <name> .
" there ai n't water enough 'tween here an' <unk> to wash the <unk> off'n his boots .
he 's jest everlastin ' farmer .
why , harve , i 've seen thet man hitch up a bucket , long towards sundown , an ' set <unk> ' the <unk> to the <unk> same 's ef <unk> a cow 's bag .
he 's thet much farmer .
well , penn an ' he they ran the farm  up exeter way , <unk> .
uncle salters he sold it this spring to a <name> from boston as wanted to build a <unk> , an ' he got a heap for it .
well , them two <unk> scratched along till , one day , penn 's church he 'd belonged to  the <unk>  found out where he wuz drifted an ' layin ' , an ' wrote to uncle salters .
'never heerd what they said exactly ; but uncle salters was mad .
he 's a <unk> mostly  but he jest let 'em hev it both sides o ' the bow , <unk> he was a baptist , an ' sez he war n't goin ' to give up penn to any blame <unk> connection in pennsylvania or anywheres else .
then he come to dad , <unk> ' penn ,  thet was two trips back ,  an ' sez he an ' penn must fish a trip fer their health .
'guess he thought the <unk> would n't hunt the banks fer <name> <unk> .
dad was agreeable , fer uncle salters he'd been <unk> ' off an ' on fer thirty years , when he war n't <unk> patent <unk> , an ' he took <unk> in the 'we 're here ' ; an ' the trip done penn so much good , dad made a habit o ' takin ' him .
some day , dad sez , he 'll remember his wife an ' kids an ' <unk> , an ' then , like 's not , he 'll die , dad sez .
do n't <name> talk about <unk> ner such things to penn , <unk> uncle salters he 'll heave ye overboard . "
" poor penn ! "
murmured <name> .
" i should n't ever have thought uncle salters cared for him by the look of 'em together . "
" i like penn , though ; we all do , " said <name> .
" we ought to <name> ' give him a tow , but i wanted to tell ye first . "
they were close to the schooner now , the other boats a little behind them .
" you need n't heave in the dories till after dinner , " said troop , from the deck .
" we 'll <unk> right off .
fix table , boys ! "
" <unk> the <unk> , " said <name> , with a wink , as he set the gear for <unk> .
" look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin ' .
they 're all waitin ' on dad .
see 'em , harve ? "
" they are all alike to me . "
and , indeed , to a landsman the nodding schooners around seemed run from the same mould .
" they ai n't , though .
that yaller , dirty packet with her bowsprit <unk> that way , she 's the <unk> of <unk> ' .
<name> <name> 's her skipper , the meanest man on the banks .
we 'll tell him so when we strike the main ledge .
'way off <unk> 's the <unk> 's eye ' .
the two <unk> own her .
she 's from harwich ; <unk> , too , an ' hez good luck ; but dad he 'd find fish in a graveyard .
them other three , side along , they 're the <unk> smith ' , <unk> ' , and <unk> s. walen ' , all <unk> home .
'guess we 'll see the <unk> m. <unk> ' <unk> , dad , wo n't we ?
they 're all <unk> over from the shoal o ' <unk> . "
" you wo n't see many boats to-morrow , <name> . "
when troop called his son <name> , it was a sign that the old man was pleased .
" boys , we 're too crowded , " he went on , addressing the crew as they clambered <unk> .
" we 'll leave 'em to bait big an ' catch small . "
he looked at the catch in the pen , and it was curious to see how little and level the fish ran .
save for <name> 's <unk> , there was nothing over fifteen pounds on deck .
" i 'm waitin ' on the weather , " he added .
" ye 'll have to make it yourself , disko , for there 's no sign i can see , " said long <name> , sweeping the clear horizon .
and yet , half an hour later , as they were <unk> , the bank fog dropped on them , " between fish and fish , " as they say .
it drove steadily and in wreaths , curling and smoking along the colourless water .
the men stopped <unk> without a word .
long <name> and uncle salters slipped the <unk> into their sockets , and began to heave up the anchor , the windlass jarring as the wet <unk> cable strained on the barrel .
<name> and <name> platt gave a hand at the last .
the anchor came up with a sob , and the <unk> <unk> as troop steadied her at the wheel .
" up jib and foresail , " said he .
" slip 'em in the smother , " shouted long <name> , making fast the <unk> , while the others raised the clacking , rattling rings of the foresail ; and the <unk> creaked as the " we 're here " looked up into the wind and dived off into blank , whirling white .
" there 's wind behind this fog , " said troop .
it was all wonderful beyond words to <name> ; and the most wonderful part was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from troop , ending with , " that 's good , my son ! "
" 'never seen anchor weighed before ? "
said <name> platt , to <name> gaping at the damp canvas of the foresail .
" no .
where are we going ? "
" fish and make berth , as you 'll find out 'fore you 've bin a week aboard .
it 's all new to you , but we never know what may come to us .
now , take me  <name> platt  i 'd never <name> ' thought  " " it 's better than fourteen dollars a month an ' a bullet in your belly , " said troop , from the wheel .
" ease your <unk> a grind . "
" dollars an ' cents better , " returned the man-o'-war 's man , doing something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it .
" but we didn't think o ' that when we manned the <unk> on the <unk> <name> <name> ' , [ 1 ] outside beaufort harbor , with fort <unk> <unk> ' hot shot at our stern , an ' a livin ' <name> atop of all .
where was you then , disko ? "
" jest here , or hereabouts , " disko replied , " <unk> ' my bread on the deep waters , and <unk> ' <unk> <unk> .
'sorry i ca n't accommodate you with red-hot shot , <name> platt ; but i guess we 'll come aout all right on wind 'fore we see eastern point . "
there was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now , varied by a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the fo'c'sle .
the rigging dripped clammy drops , and the men lounged along the <name> of the house  all save uncle salters , who sat stiffly on the <unk> nursing his stung hands .
[ 1 ] the <unk> , u. s. n. ?
" 'guess she 'd <name> <unk> , " said disko , rolling one eye at his brother .
" guess she would n't to any <unk> profit .
what 's the sense o ' <unk> canvas ? "
the <unk> replied .
the wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in disko 's hands .
a few seconds later a hissing <unk> slashed diagonally across the boat , smote uncle salters between the shoulders , and drenched him from head to foot .
he rose sputtering , and went forward , only to catch another .
" see dad <name> him , all around the deck , " said <name> .
" uncle salters he thinks his <unk> 's our canvas .
dad 's put this <unk> ' act up on him two trips runnin ' .
hi !
that found him where he feeds . "
uncle salters had taken refuge by the foremast , but a wave slapped him over the knees .
disko 's face was as blank as the circle of the wheel .
" 'guess she 'd lie easier under <unk> , salters , " said disko , as though he had seen nothing .
" set your old kite , then , " roared the victim , through a cloud of spray ; " only do n't lay it to me if anything happens .
penn , you go below right off an ' git your coffee .
you ought to hev more sense than to <unk> araound on deck this weather . "
" now they 'll <unk> coffee an ' play <unk> till the cows come home , " said <name> , as uncle salters hustled penn into the <unk> .
" <unk> to me like 's if we 'd all be doin ' so fer a spell .
there 's nothin ' in creation <unk> a banker when she ai n't on fish . "
" i 'm glad ye spoke , <name> , " cried long <name> , who had been casting round in search of amusement .
" i 'd clean forgot we 'd a passenger under that <unk> hat .
there 's no idleness for thim that do n't know their ropes .
pass him along , <name> platt , an ' we 'll <unk> him . "
" 'tai n't my trick this time , " grinned <name> .
" you 've got to go it alone .
dad learned me with a rope 's end . "
for an hour long <name> walked his prey up and down , teaching , as he said , " things at the sea that ivry man must know , blind , dhrunk , or asleep . "
there is not much gear to a <unk> schooner with a <unk> , but long <name> had a gift of expression .
when he wished to draw <name> 's attention to the <unk> , he dug his knuckles into the back of the boy 's neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute .
he <unk> the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing <name> 's nose along a few feet of the boom , and the lead of each rope was fixed in <name> 's mind by the end of the rope itself .
the lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free ; but there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man .
forward lay the windlass and its tackle , with the chain and <unk> cables , all very unpleasant to trip over ; the fo'c'sle stovepipe , and the <unk> by the <unk> to hold the <unk> .
aft of these the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> took all the space that was not needed for the pumps and <unk> .
then came the nests of dories lashed to <unk> by the quarter-deck ; the house , with tubs and <unk> lashed all around it ; and , last , the <unk> <unk> in its crutch , splitting things <unk> , to duck and dodge under every time .
<name> platt , of course , could not keep his oar out of the business , but ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails and spars on the old ohio .
" niver mind fwhat he says ; <unk> to me , <unk> .
<name> platt , this <unk> 's not the ohio , an ' you 're mixing the bhoy bad . "
" he 'll be ruined for life , beginnin ' on a <unk> this way , " <name> platt pleaded .
" give him a chance to know a few <unk> ' principles .
<unk> 's an <name> , <name> , as i 'd show you if i had ye in the <unk> o' the  " " i know ut .
ye 'd talk him dead an ' <unk> .
<unk> , <name> platt !
now , after all i 've said , how 'd you reef the foresail , harve ' ?
take your time <unk> ' . "
" haul that in , " said <name> , pointing to leeward .
" fwhat ?
the north <unk> ? "
" no , the boom .
then run that rope you showed me back there  " " that 's no way , " <name> platt burst in .
" quiet !
he 's <unk> ' , an ' has not the names good yet .
go on , harve . "
" oh , it 's the <unk> .
i 'd hook the tackle on to the <unk> , and then let down  " " lower the sail , child !
lower ! "
said <name> platt , in a professional agony .
" lower the <unk> <unk> , " <name> went on .
those names stuck in his head .
" lay your hand on thim , " said long <name> .
<name> obeyed .
" lower till that <unk>  on the <unk>  <name>  no , it 's <unk>  till the <unk> was down on the boom .
then i 'd tie her up the way you said , and then i 'd hoist up the <unk> <unk> again . "
" you 've forgot to pass the <unk> , but wid time and help <unk> <unk> .
there 's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard , or else 'twould be overboard .
d 'ye follow me ?
't is dollars an ' cents i'm puttin ' into your pocket , ye skinny little supercargo , so that <unk> ye 've filled out ye can ship from boston to cuba an ' tell thim long <name> <unk> you .
now i 'll <name> ye around a piece , callin ' the ropes , an ' you 'll lay your hand on thim as i call . "
he began , and <name> , who was feeling rather tired , walked slowly to the rope named .
a rope 's end licked round his ribs , and nearly knocked the breath out of him .
" when you own a boat , " said <name> platt , with severe eyes , " you can walk .
till then , take all orders at the run .
once more  to make sure ! "
<name> was in a glow with the exercise , and this last cut warmed him thoroughly .
now , he was a singularly smart boy , the son of a very clever man and a very sensitive woman , with a fine resolute temper that systematic spoiling had nearly turned to <unk> obstinacy .
he looked at the other men , and saw that even <name> did not smile .
it was evidently all in the day 's work , though it hurt abominably ; so he swallowed the hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin .
the same smartness that led him to take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on the boat , except , maybe , penn , would stand the least nonsense .
one learns a great deal from a mere tone .
long <name> called over half a dozen more ropes , and <name> danced over the deck like an eel at <unk> , one eye on <name> platt .
" ver ' good .
ver ' good done , " said <name> .
" after supper i show you a little schooner i make , with all her ropes .
so we shall learn . "
" <unk> fer  a passenger , " said <name> .
" dad he 's jest allowed you'll be wuth your salt maybe 'fore you 're <unk> .
thet 's a heap fer dad .
i 'll learn you more our next watch together . "
" taller ! "
grunted disko , peering through the fog as it smoked over the bows .
there was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging <unk> , while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn , pale waves whispering and <unk> one to the other .
" now i 'll learn you something long <name> ca n't , " shouted <name> platt , as from a locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead hollowed at one end , smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton tallow , and went forward .
" i 'll learn you how to fly the blue pigeon .
<unk> ! "
disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner 's way , while <name> , with <name> to help ( and a proud boy was <name> ) , let down the jib in a lump on the boom .
the lead <name> a deep droning song as <name> platt whirled it round and round .
" go ahead , man , " said long <name> , impatiently .
" we 're not <unk> twenty-five fut off fire island in a fog .
there 's no trick to ut . "
" do n't be jealous , galway . "
the released lead <unk> into the sea far ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward .
" <unk> ' is a trick , though , " said <name> , " when your <unk> lead 's all the eye you 're like to hev for a week .
what d'you make it , dad ? "
disko 's face relaxed .
his skill and honour were involved in the march he had stolen on the rest of the fleet , and he had his reputation as a master artist who knew the banks blindfold .
" sixty , mebbe  ef i 'm any judge , " he replied , with a glance at the <name> compass in the window of the house .
" sixty , " <name> out <name> platt , hauling in great wet coils .
the schooner gathered way once more .
" heave ! "
said disko , after a quarter of an hour .
" what d'you make it ? "
<name> whispered , and he looked at <name> proudly .
but <name> was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just then .
" fifty , " said the father .
" i mistrust we 're right over the <name> o' green bank on old <unk> . "
" fifty ! "
roared <name> platt .
they could scarcely see him through the fog .
" she 's <unk> within a yard  like the shells at fort <unk> . "
" bait up , harve , " said <name> , diving for a line on the reel .
the schooner seemed to be <unk> promiscuously through the smother , her <unk> banging wildly .
the men waited and looked at the boys , who began fishing .
" <unk> ! "
<name> 's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail .
" now haow in thunder did dad know ?
help us here , harve .
it 's a big <name> .
<unk> , too . "
they hauled together , and landed a <unk> <unk> cod .
he had taken the bait right into his stomach .
" why , he 's all covered with little crabs , " cried <name> , turning him over .
" by the great <unk> , they 're <unk> already , " said long <name> .
" disko , ye kape your spare eyes under the keel . "
splash went the anchor , and they all heaved over the lines , each man taking his own place at the bulwarks .
" are they good to eat ? "
<name> panted , as he lugged in another <unk> cod .
" sure .
when they 're <unk> it 's a sign they 've all been <unk> ' together by the thousand , and when they take the bait that way they 're hungry .
never mind how the bait sets .
they 'll bite on the bare hook . "
" say , this is great ! "
<name> cried , as the fish came in gasping and splashing  nearly all <unk> , as <name> had said .
" why ca n't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories ? "
" allus can , till we begin to <unk> .
<unk> thet , the heads and <unk> <unk> 'd scare the fish to <unk> .
<unk> ' ai n't reckoned progressive , though , unless ye know as much as dad knows .
guess we'll run aout <unk> trawl to-night .
harder on the back , this , than <unk> the dory , ai n't it ? "
it was rather <unk> work , for in a dory the weight of a cod is <unk> till the last minute , and you are , so to speak , abreast of him ; but the few feet of a schooner 's <unk> make so much extra <unk> , and stooping over the bulwarks <unk> the stomach .
but it was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted ; and a big pile lay aboard when the fish ceased biting .
" where 's penn and uncle salters ? "
<name> asked , slapping the slime off his <unk> , and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the others .
" git 's coffee and see . "
under the yellow glare of the lamp on the <unk> , the fo'c'sle table down and opened , utterly unconscious of fish or weather , sat the two men , a <unk> between them , uncle salters snarling at <unk> every move .
" what 's the matter naow ? "
said the former , as <name> , one hand in the leather loop at the head of the ladder , <name> shouting to the cook .
" big fish and <unk> and heaps , " <name> replied , quoting long <name> .
" how 's the game ? "
little penn 's jaw dropped .
" <unk> n't none o ' his fault , " snapped uncle salters .
" penn 's deef . "
" <unk> , were n't it ? "
said <name> , as <name> staggered aft with the steaming coffee in a tin pail .
" that lets us out o ' <unk> ' up to-night .
dad 's a jest man .
they 'll have to do it . "
" an ' two young fellers i know 'll bait up a tub or so o ' trawl , while they 're <unk> ' , " said disko , lashing the wheel to his taste .
" urn !
'guess i 'd ruther clean up , dad . "
" do n't doubt it .
ye <unk> n't , though .
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> pitch while you two bait up . "
" why in thunder did n't them blame boys tell us you 'd struck on ? "
said uncle salters , shuffling to his place at the table .
" this <unk> <unk> , <name> . "
" ef <unk> ' out cable do n't wake ye , guess you 'd better hire a boy o' your own , " said <name> , <unk> about in the dusk over the tubs full of <unk> lashed to windward of the house .
" oh , harve , do n't ye want to slip down an ' git 's bait ? "
" bait ez we are , " said disko .
" i mistrust <unk> ' <name> pay better , ez things go . "
that meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the fish were cleaned  an improvement on paddling <unk> in the little <unk> below .
the tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a big hook each few feet ; and the testing and <unk> of every single hook , with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear when shot from the dory , was a scientific business .
<name> managed it in the dark without looking , while <name> caught his fingers on the barbs and <unk> his fate .
but the hooks flew through <name> 's fingers like <unk> on an old maid 's lap .
" i helped bait up trawl ashore 'fore i could well walk , " he said .
" but it 's a <unk> ' job all the same .
oh , dad ! "
this shouted towards the hatch , where disko and <name> platt were <unk> .
" how many skates you reckon we 'll need ? "
" <unk> three .
hurry ! "
" there 's three hundred fathom to each tub , " <name> explained ; " more'n enough to lay out tonight .
ouch !
<unk> up there , i did . "
he stuck his finger in his mouth .
" i tell you , harve , there ai n't money in <unk> 'd hire me to ship on a reg'lar trawler .
it may be progressive , but , barrin ' that , it 's the <unk> , <unk> business top of earth . "
" i do n't know what this is , if 't is n't regular <unk> , " said <name> , sulkily .
" my fingers are all cut to <unk> . "
" pshaw !
this is jest one o ' dad 's blame experiments .
he do n't trawl 'less there 's mighty good reason fer it .
dad knows .
thet 's why he's <unk> ' ez he is .
we 'll hev her <unk> ' full when we take her up er we wo n't see a fin . "
penn and uncle salters cleaned up as disko had ordained , but the boys profited little .
no sooner were the tubs furnished than <name> platt and long <name> , who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern , snatched them away , loaded up the tubs and some small , painted <unk> , and hove the boat overboard into what <name> regarded as an exceedingly rough sea .
" they 'll be drowned .
why , the dory 's loaded like a <unk> , " he cried .
" we 'll be back , " said long <name> , " an ' in case you 'll not be lookin ' for us , we 'll lay into you both if the trawl 's snarled . "
the dory surged up on the crest of a wave , and just when it seemed impossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooner 's side , slid over the ridge , and was swallowed up in the damp dusk .
" take <unk> here , an ' keep <unk> ' steady , " said <name> , passing <name> the <unk> of a <name> that <name> just behind the windlass .
<name> rang lustily , for he felt two lives depended on him .
but disko in the cabin , <unk> in the <unk> , did not look like a murderer , and when he went to supper he even smiled drily at the anxious <name> .
" this ai n't no weather , " said <name> .
" why , you an ' me could set thet trawl !
they 've only gone out jest far 'nough so 's not to foul our cable .
they do n't need no <name> <unk> . "
" clang !
cling !
clang ! "
<name> kept it up , varied with occasional <unk> , for another half-hour .
there was a bellow and a bump alongside .
<name> and <name> raced to the hooks of the <unk> ; long <name> and <name> platt arrived on deck together , it seemed , one half the north atlantic at their backs , and the dory followed them in the air , landing with a clatter .
" nary snarl , " said <name> platt , as he dripped .
" <name> , you 'll do yet . "
" the pleasure av your comp'ny to the <unk> , " said long <name> , <unk> the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and stuck an <unk> arm into <name> 's face .
" we do be <unk> to honour the second half wid our presence . "
and off they all four rolled to supper , where <name> stuffed himself to the brim on <unk> and fried pies , and fell fast asleep just as <name> produced from a locker a lovely <unk> model of the <name> holmes , his first boat , and was going to show <name> the ropes .
<name> never even <unk> his fingers as penn pushed him into his bunk .
" it must be a sad thing  a very sad thing , " said penn , watching the boy 's face , " for his mother and his father , who think he is dead .
to lose a child  to lose a man-child ! "
" git out o ' this , penn , " said <name> .
" go aft and finish your game with uncle salters .
tell dad i 'll stand harve 's watch ef he do n't <unk> .
he's played aout . "
" ver ' good boy , " said <name> , slipping out of his boots and disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk .
" <unk> ' he make good man , <name> .
i no see he is any so mad as your <unk> he says .
eh , wha-at ? "
<name> chuckled , but the chuckle ended in a snore .
it was thick weather outside , with a rising wind , and the elder men stretched their watches .
the hours struck clear in the cabin ; the nosing bows slapped and <unk> with the seas ; the fo'c'sle stovepipe hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it ; and the boys slept on , while disko , long <name> , <name> <unk> , and uncle salters , each in turn , stumped aft to look at the wheel , forward to see that the anchor held , or to <unk> out a little more cable against chafing , with a glance at the dim <unk> between each round .
chapter iv <name> waked to find the " first half " at <unk> , the fo'c'sle door drawn to a crack , and every square inch of the schooner singing its own tune .
the black bulk of the cook balanced behind the <name> galley over the glare of the stove , and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it <name> and <unk> to each plunge .
up and up the fo'c'sle climbed , yearning and surging and quivering , and then , with a clear , <unk> swoop , came down into the seas .
he could hear the flaring bows cut and <unk> , and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above , like a volley of <unk> .
followed the woolly sound of the cable in the <unk> ; a grunt and squeal of the windlass ; a <unk> , a <unk> , and a kick , and the " we 're here " gathered herself together to repeat the motions .
" now , ashore , " he heard long <name> saying , " ye 've <unk> , an ' ye must do thim in any weather .
here we 're well clear of the fleet , an ' we 've no <unk>  an ' that 's a <unk> ' .
good night , all . "
he passed like a big snake from the table to his bunk , and began to smoke .
<name> platt followed his example ; uncle salters , with penn , fought his way up the ladder to stand his watch , and the cook set for the " second half . "
it came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs , with a shake and a yawn .
it ate till it could eat no more ; and then <name> filled his pipe with some terrible tobacco , <unk> himself between the <unk> and a forward bunk , cocked his feet up on the table , and smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke .
<name> lay at length in his bunk , wrestling with a gaudy , <unk> accordion , whose tunes went up and down with the pitching of the " we 're here " .
the cook , his shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies ( <name> was fond of fried pies ) , peeled potatoes , with one eye on the stove in event of too much water finding its way down the pipe ; and the general smell and smother were past all description .
<name> considered affairs , wondered that he was not <unk> sick , and crawled into his bunk again , as the softest and safest place , while <name> struck up , " i do n't want to play in your yard , " as accurately as the wild jerks allowed .
" how long is this for ? "
<name> asked of <name> .
" till she get a little quiet , and we can row to trawl .
perhaps to-night .
perhaps two days more .
you do not like ?
eh , wha-at ? "
" i should have been crazy sick a week ago , but it does n't seem to upset me now  much . "
" that is because we make you fisherman , these days .
if i was you , when i come to gloucester i would give two , three big candles for my good luck . "
" give who ? "
" to be sure  the virgin of our church on the hill .
she is very good to fishermen all the time .
that is why so few of us <unk> men ever are drowned . "
" you 're a <name> catholic , then ? "
" i am a madeira man .
i am not a porto <unk> boy .
shall i be baptist , then ?
eh , wha-at ?
i always give candles  two , three more when i come to gloucester .
the good virgin she never forgets me , <name> . "
" i do n't sense it that way , " <name> platt put in from his bunk , his scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe .
" it stands to reason the sea 's the sea ; and you 'll git jest about what 's goin ' , candles or kerosene , fer that matter . "
" tis a mighty good thing , " said long <name> , " to have a <unk> at <unk> , though .
i 'm o ' <name> 's way o ' thinkin ' .
about tin years back i was crew to a sou ' boston <unk> .
we was off <unk> 's ledge wid a <unk> , butt first , atop of us , <unk> <unk> .
the ould man was dhrunk , his <name> <unk> ' on the tiller , an ' i sez to myself , 'if iver i stick my <unk> into <unk> again , i 'll show the saints fwhat manner o ' craft they saved me out av . '
now , i 'm here , as ye can well see , an' the model of the dhirty ould <name> , that took me a month to make , i gave ut to the priest , an ' he <name> ut up forninst the altar .
there's more sense in givin ' a model that 's by way o ' bein ' a work av <name> than any candle .
ye can buy candles at store , but a model shows the good saints ye 've tuk trouble an ' are grateful . "
" d'you believe that , <name> ? "
said <name> platt , turning on his elbow .
" would i do ut if i did not , ohio ? "
" <unk> , <name> fuller he made a model o ' the old ohio , and she 's to salem museum now .
mighty pretty model , too , but i guess <name> he never done it fer no sacrifice ; an ' the way i take it is  " there were the <unk> of an <unk> discussion of the kind that fishermen love , where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one proves anything at the end , had not <name> struck up this cheerful rhyme : " up jumped the mackerel with his striped back .
reef in the mainsail , and haul on the tack ; for it 's <name> weather  " here long <name> joined in : " and it 's <unk> weather ; when the winds begin to blow , pipe all hands together ! "
<name> went on , with a cautious look at <name> <unk> , holding the accordion low in the bunk : " up jumped the cod with his <unk> , went to the <unk> to heave at the lead ; for it 's <name> weather , " etc .
<name> platt seemed to be hunting for something .
<name> crouched lower , but sang louder : " up jumped the <unk> that swims to the ground .
<unk> !
<unk> !
mind where ye sound ! "
<name> platt 's huge rubber boot whirled across the fo'c'sle and caught <name> 's uplifted arm .
there was war between the man and the boy ever since <name> had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would make him angry as he heaved the lead .
" thought i 'd fetch <name> , " said <name> , returning the gift with precision .
" ef you do n't like my music , git out your fiddle .
i ai n't goin ' to lie here all day an ' listen to you an ' long <name> <unk> ' <unk> candles .
fiddle , <name> platt ; or i 'll learn harve here the tune ! "
<name> platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle .
<name> 's eye glistened , and from somewhere behind the <unk> he <name> out a <name> , <unk> thing with wire strings , which he called a <unk> .
" 't is a concert , " said long <name> , beaming through the smoke .
" a reg'lar boston concert . "
there was a burst of spray as the hatch opened , and disko , in yellow <unk> , descended .
" ye 're just in time , disko .
fwhat 's she doin ' outside ? "
" jest this ! "
he dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of the " we 're here " .
" we 're singin ' to kape our breakfasts down .
ye 'll lead , av course , disko , " said long <name> .
" guess there ai n't more'n <unk> two old songs i know , an ' ye 've heerd them both . "
his excuses were cut short by <name> platt launching into a most <unk> tune , like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts .
with his eyes fixed on the beams above , disko began this ancient , ancient ditty , <name> platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words fit a little : " there is a crack packet  crack packet o ' fame , she hails from noo york , an ' the <unk> 's her name .
you may talk o ' your <unk>  swallow-tail and black ball  but the <unk> 's the packet that can beat them all .
" now the <unk> she lies in the river <unk> , because of the <unk> to take her to sea ; but when she 's off soundings you shortly <name> know ( chorus . )
she 's the liverpool packet  o lord , let her go !
" now the <unk> she 's <unk> ' <unk> the banks o ' newfoundland , where the water 's all shallow and the bottom 's all sand .
sez all the little fishes that swim to an ' fro : ( chorus . )
'she 's the liverpool packet  o lord , let her go ! ' "
there were scores of verses , for he worked the <unk> every mile of the way between liverpool and new york as conscientiously as though he were on her deck , and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked beside him .
<name> platt followed with something about " the rough and tough <unk> , who would pilot the vessel in . "
then they called on <name> , who felt very flattered , to contribute to the entertainment ; but all that he could remember were some pieces of " skipper <unk> ride " that he had been taught at the <unk> in the adirondacks .
it seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place , but he had no more than mentioned the title when disko brought down one foot with a bang , and cried , " do n't go on , young feller .
that 's a mistaken <unk>  one o ' the worst kind , too , <unk> it 's <unk> ' to the ear . "
" i <unk> <name> ' warned you , " said <name> .
" thet allus fetches dad . "
" what 's wrong ? "
said <name> , surprised and a little angry .
" all you 're goin ' to say , " said disko .
" all dead wrong from start to finish , an ' whittier he 's to blame .
i have no special call to right any <unk> man , but 'twere n't no fault o ' <unk> 's .
my father he told me the tale time an ' again , an ' this is the way <unk> . "
" for the <name> <unk> time , " put in long <name> , under his breath .
" <name> <unk> he was skipper o ' the <name> , young feller , comin ' home <unk> the banks  that was before the war of 1812 , but <unk> is <unk> at all times .
they <unk> the active o ' portland , an ' <unk> o ' that town he was her skipper ; they <unk> her <unk> ' off cape cod light .
there was a <unk> <name> on , an ' they was gettin ' the <name> home 's fast as they could <unk> her .
well , <unk> he said there war n't any sense to <unk> ' a boat in that sea ; the men they would n't hev it ; and he laid it before them to stay by the active till the sea run daown a piece .
they would n't hev that either , hangin ' araound the cape in any sech weather , leak or no leak .
they jest up <unk> an ' quit , <unk> takin ' <unk> with 'em .
folks to <unk> was mad at him not <unk> the risk , and <unk> nex ' day , when the sea was <unk> ( they never stopped to think o ' that ) , some of the active 's folk was took off by a truro man .
they come into <unk> with their own tale to tell , sayin ' how <unk> had shamed his town , an ' so forth an ' so on ; an' <unk> 's men they was scared , seem ' public feelin ' ag'in ' 'em , an ' they went back on <unk> , an ' swore he was <unk> for the hull act .
'twere n't the women neither that tarred and feathered him  <unk> women do n't act that way  't was a <unk> o ' men an ' boys , an ' they carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout , an' <unk> he told 'em they 'd be sorry for it some day .
well , the facts came aout later , same 's they usually do , too late to be any ways useful to an honest man ; an ' whittier he come along an ' picked up the slack <unk> of a lyin ' tale , an ' tarred and feathered <name> <unk> all over onct more after he was dead .
't was the only time whittier ever slipped up , an ' 'twere n't fair .
i <unk> <name> good when he brought that piece back from school .
you do n't know no better , o ' course ; but i 've give you the facts , hereafter an ' evermore to be remembered .
<name> <unk> weren't no sech kind o ' man as whittier makes aout ; my father he knew him well , before an ' after that business , an ' you beware o ' hasty <unk> , young feller .
next ! "
<name> had never heard disko talk so long , and collapsed with burning cheeks ; but , as <name> said promptly , a boy could only learn what he was taught at school , and life was too short to keep track of every lie along the coast .
then <name> touched the <unk> , jarring little <unk> to a queer tune , and sang something in portuguese about " <name> , <unk> ! "
ending with a <unk> sweep that brought the song up with a jerk .
then disko obliged with his second song , to an old-fashioned <unk> tune , and all joined in the chorus .
this is one stanza : " now <unk> is over and melted the snow , and outer noo bedford we shortly must tow ; yes , out o ' noo bedford we shortly must clear , we 're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear . "
here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself , and then : " <unk> , my <unk> 's <unk> blowin ' ; <unk> , we 're goin ' off to sea ; <unk> , i left you fit for <unk> ' ; when i come back a loaf o ' bread you 'll be ! "
that made <name> almost weep , though he could not tell why .
but it was much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands for the fiddle .
still leaning against the locker door , he struck into a tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you did .
after a little he sang in an unknown tongue , his big <name> down on the <unk> , his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight .
<name> swung out of his bunk to hear better ; and amid the straining of the timbers and the wash of the waters the tune <unk> and moaned on , like <name> surf in a blind fog , till it ended with a wail .
" <name> christmas !
thet gives me the blue <unk> , " said <name> .
" what in thunder is it ? "
" the song of fin <unk> , " said the cook , " when he <unk> going to norway . "
his english was not thick , but all <unk> , as though it came from a phonograph .
" <name> , i 've been to norway , but i did n't make that <unk> noise .
't is like some of the old songs , though , " said long <name> , sighing .
" do n't let 's hev another 'thout somethin ' between , " said <name> ; and the accordion struck up a rattling , <unk> tune that ended : " it 's six an ' twenty sundays sence las ' we saw the land , with fifteen hunder <unk> , an ' fifteen hunder <unk> , <unk> hunder <unk> ' <unk> , <unk> ' old <unk> an ' grand ! "
" hold on ! "
roared <name> <unk> " d 'ye want to nail the trip , <name> ?
that's <name> sure , 'less you sing it after all our salt 's wet . "
" no , 'tai n't .
is it , dad ?
not unless you sing the very las ' verse .
you ca n't learn me anything on <unk> ! "
" what 's that ? "
said <name> .
" what 's a <name> ? "
" a <name> 's anything that spoils the luck .
sometimes it 's a man  sometimes it 's a boy  or a bucket .
i 've known a <unk> <name> two trips till we was on to her , " said <name> <unk> .
" there 's all sorts o ' <unk> .
<name> <unk> was one till he was drowned on <unk> .
i'd never ship with <name> <unk> , not if i was <unk> ' .
there wuz a green dory on the <name> flood .
thet was a <name> too , the worst sort o ' <name> .
drowned four men she did , an ' used to shine fiery o ' nights in the nest . "
" and you believe that ? "
said <name> , remembering what <name> platt had said about candles and models .
" have n't we all got to take what's served ? "
a mutter of dissent ran round the bunks .
" <unk> , yes ; <unk> , things can happen , " said disko .
" do n't you go makin ' a mock of <unk> , young feller . "
" well , harve ai n't no <name> .
day after we catched him , " <name> cut in , " we had a <unk> ' good catch . "
the cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly  a queer , thin laugh .
he was a most disconcerting nigger .
" murder ! "
said long <name> .
" do n't do that again , doctor .
we ai n't used to ut . "
" what 's wrong ? "
said <name> .
" ai n't he our <unk> , and did n't they strike on good after we 'd struck him ? "
" oh !
yess , " said the cook .
" i know that , but the catch <unk> not finish yet . "
" he ai n't goin ' to do us any harm , " said <name> , hotly .
" where are ye <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' to ?
he 's all right . "
" no harm .
no .
but one day he <name> be your master , <name> . "
" that all ? "
said <name> , placidly .
" he <unk> n't  not by a <unk> . "
" master ! "
said the cook , pointing to <name> .
" man ! "
and he pointed to <name> .
" that 's news .
haow soon ? "
said <name> , with a laugh .
" in some years , and i shall see it .
master and man  man and master . "
" how in thunder d 'ye work that out ? "
said <name> platt .
" in my head , where i can see . "
" haow ? "
this from all the others at once .
" i do not know , but so it <name> be . "
he dropped his head , and went on <unk> the potatoes , and not another word could they get out of him .
" well , " said <name> , " a heap o ' things 'll hev to come abaout 'fore <unk> any master o ' mine ; but i 'm glad the doctor ai n't <unk> to <name> him for a <name> .
now , i mistrust uncle salters fer the <unk> <name> in the fleet <unk> ' his own special luck .
dunno ef it 's <unk> same 's smallpox .
he ought to be on the <name> pitman .
that boat 's her own <name> , sure  crews an ' gear make no differ to her <unk> ' .
<name> christmas !
she 'll <unk> loose in a flat <unk> . "
" we 're well dear o ' the fleet , anyway , " said disko , " <name> pitman an' all . "
there was a rapping on the deck .
" uncle salters has catched his luck , " said <name> , as his father departed .
" it 's blown clear , " disko cried , and all the fo'c'sle tumbled up for a bit of fresh air .
the fog had gone , but a sullen sea ran in great rollers behind it .
the " we 're here " slid , as it were , into long , sunk avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they would only stay still ; but they changed without rest or <name> , and flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills , while the wind hooted through her rigging as she <unk> down the slopes .
far away a sea would burst in a sheet of foam , and the others would follow suit as at a signal , till <name> 's eyes swam with the vision of <unk> whites and <unk> .
four or five mother <name> 's chickens stormed round in circles , shrieking as they swept past the bows .
a <unk> or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste , ran down wind and back again , and melted away .
" 'seems to me i saw somethin ' flicker jest naow over yonder , " said uncle salters , pointing to the northeast .
" ca n't be any of the fleet , " said disko , peering under his eyebrows , a hand on the fo'c'sle gangway as the solid bows <unk> into the troughs .
" sea 's <unk> ' over <unk> fast .
<name> , do n't you want to skip up a piece an ' see how <unk> <unk> lays ? "
<name> , in his big boots , trotted rather than climbed up the main rigging ( this consumed <name> with envy ) , hitched himself around the reeling <unk> , and let his eye <unk> till it caught the <name> black <unk> on the shoulder of a <unk> swell .
" she 's all right , " he hailed .
" sail o !
dead to the <unk> , <unk> down like smoke !
schooner she be , too . "
they waited yet another half-hour , the sky clearing in patches , with a flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of <unk> water .
then a <unk> lifted , ducked , and disappeared , to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with old-fashioned wooden <unk> <unk> .
the sails were <unk> .
" frenchmen ! "
shouted <name> .
" no , 'tai n't , neither .
<unk> ! "
" that 's no french , " said disko .
" salters , your blame luck holds <unk> a screw in a <unk> . "
" i 've eyes .
it 's uncle <unk> . "
" you ca n't nowise tell fer sure . "
" the <unk> of all <unk> , " groaned <name> platt .
" oh , salters , salters , why was n't you abed an ' asleep ?
" how could i tell ? "
said poor salters , as the schooner swung up .
she might have been the very flying dutchman , so foul , draggled , and unkempt was every rope and stick aboard .
her <unk> quarter-deck was some four or five feet high , and her rigging flew knotted and tangled like weed at a <unk> .
she was running before the wind  <unk> frightfully  her <unk> let down to act as a sort of extra foresail ,  " <unk> , " they call it ,  and her <unk> <unk> out over the side .
her bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned frigate 's ; her <unk> had been fished and <unk> and nailed and <unk> beyond further repair ; and as she hove herself forward , and sat down on her broad tail , she looked for all the world like a <unk> , <unk> , bad old woman sneering at a decent girl .
" that 's <unk> , " said salters .
" full o ' gin an ' <unk> men , an ' the judgments o ' providence layin ' fer him an ' never takin ' good holt .
he's run in to bait , <unk> way . "
" he 'll run her under , " said long <name> .
" that 's no rig fer this weather . "
" not he , <unk> he 'd 'a ' done it long ago , " disko replied .
" looks 's if he <unk> to run us under .
ai n't she daown by the head more'n natural , <name> platt ? "
" ef it 's his style o ' <unk> ' her she ai n't safe , " said the sailor , slowly .
" ef she 's <unk> her oakum he 'd better git to his pumps mighty quick . "
the creature thrashed up , wore round with a clatter and rattle , and lay head to wind within <unk> .
a <unk> wagged over the bulwark , and a thick voice yelled something <name> could not understand .
but disko 's face darkened .
" he 'd resk every stick he hez to <name> bad news .
says we 're in fer a shift o' wind .
he 's in fer worse .
<unk> !
<unk> ! "
he waved his arm up and down with the gesture of a man at the pumps , and pointed forward .
the crew mocked him and laughed .
" <unk> ye , an ' strip ye , an ' trip ye ! "
yelled uncle <unk> .
" a <unk> <name>  a livin ' <name> .
yah !
cast up fer your last trip , all you gloucester <unk> .
you wo n't see gloucester no more , no more ! "
" crazy full  as usual , " said <name> platt .
" wish he had n't spied us , though . "
she drifted out of hearing while the <unk> yelled something about a dance at the bay of bulls and a dead man in the fo'c'sle .
<name> shuddered .
he had seen the <unk> tilled decks and the <unk> crew .
" an ' that 's a fine little <unk> ' hell fer her draught , " said long <name> .
" i <unk> what mischief he 's been at ashore . "
" he 's a trawler , " <name> explained to <name> , " an ' he runs in fer bait all along the coast .
oh , no , not home , he do n't go .
he deals along the south an ' east shore up yonder . "
he nodded in the direction of the pitiless newfoundland beaches .
" dad wo n't never take me ashore there .
they 're a mighty tough crowd  an ' <unk> 's the <unk> .
you saw his boat ?
well , she 's nigh seventy year old , they say ; the last o ' the old <unk> <unk> .
they do n't make them <unk> any more .
<unk> do n't use <unk> , though .
he ai n't wanted there .
he <unk> <unk> 's araound , in debt , <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' like you 've heard .
bin a <name> fer years an ' years , he hez .
<unk> liquor <unk> the <unk> boats fer makin ' spells an ' selling winds an ' such truck .
crazy , i guess . "
" two n't be any use <unk> ' the trawl to-night , " said <name> platt , with quiet despair .
" he come alongside special to cuss us .
i 'd give my wage an ' share to see him at the gangway o ' the old ohio 'fore we quit <unk> ' .
jest abaout six dozen , an ' <name> <unk> layin ' 'em on <unk> ! "
the dishevelled " <unk> " danced <unk> down wind , and all eyes followed her .
suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice : " it <unk> his own death made him speak so !
he <unk> <unk>  <unk> , i tell you !
look ! "
she sailed into a patch of watery <name> three or four miles distant .
the patch dulled and faded out , and even as the light passed so did the schooner .
she dropped into a hollow and  was not .
" run under , by the great <unk> ! "
shouted disko , jumping aft .
" drunk or sober , we 've got to help 'em .
heave short and break her out !
smart ! "
<name> was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of the jib and foresail , for they hove short on the cable , and to save time , jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom , heaving in as they moved away .
this is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in matters of life and death , and the little " we 're here " complained like a human .
they ran down to where <unk> 's craft had vanished ; found two or three <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> dory , but nothing more .
" let 'em go , " said disko , though no one had hinted at picking them up .
" i would n't hev a match that belonged to <unk> aboard .
'guess she run clear under .
'must <name> ' been <unk> ' her oakum fer a week , an ' they never thought to pump her .
that 's one more boat gone along o ' leavin ' port all hands drunk . "
" <name> be ! "
said long <name> .
" we 'd <name> ' been obliged to help 'em if they was top o ' water . "
" <unk> ' o ' that myself , " said <name> platt .
" <unk> !
<unk> ! "
said the cook , rolling his eyes .
" he <unk> taken his own luck with him . "
" ver ' good thing , i think , to tell the fleet when we see .
eh , wha-at ' ? "
said <name> .
" if you <unk> that way before the wind , and she work open her seams  " he threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture , while penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and pity of it all .
<name> could not realise that he had seen death on the open waters , but he felt very sick .
then <name> went up the <unk> , and disko steered them back to within sight of their own <unk> just before the fog blanketed the sea once again .
" we go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go , " was all he said to <name> .
" you think on that for a spell , young feller .
that was liquor . "
after dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks ,  penn and uncle salters were very zealous this time ,  and the catch was large and large fish .
" <unk> has <unk> took his luck with him , " said salters .
" the wind <name> n't backed ner <unk> ner nothin ' .
how abaout the trawl ?
i despise superstition , anyway . "
<name> platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a new berth .
but the cook said : " the luck <unk> in two pieces .
you <name> find it so when you look .
i know . "
this so tickled long <name> that he <unk> <name> platt , and the two went out together .
<unk> a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory , picking off the fish , <unk> the hooks , and passing them back to the sea again something like pinning and <unk> linen on a <unk> .
it is a lengthy business and rather dangerous , for the long , <unk> line may twitch a boat under in a flash .
but when they heard , " and naow to thee , o <unk> , " booming out of the fog , the crew of the " we 're here " took heart .
the dory <unk> alongside well loaded , <name> platt yelling for <name> to act as <unk> .
" the luck 's cut square in two pieces , " said long <name> , <unk> in the fish , while <name> stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the plunging dory was saved from destruction .
" one half was jest <unk> .
<name> platt wanted to haul her an ' <name> ' done wid ut ; but i said , <unk> back the doctor that has the second sight , ' an ' the other half come up <unk> full o ' big <unk> .
hurry , <unk> , an ' bring 's a tub o ' bait .
there 's luck afloat tonight . "
the fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had just been taken , and <name> platt and long <name> moved methodically up and down the length of the trawl , the boat 's nose surging under the wet line of hooks , stripping the <unk> that they called pumpkins , <unk> off the <unk> cod against the gunwale , <unk> , and loading <name> 's dory till dusk .
" i 'll take no risks , " said disko , then  " not with him <unk> ' around so near .
<unk> wo n't sink fer a week .
heave in the dories , an ' we'll <unk> after supper . "
that was a mighty <unk> , attended by three or four blowing <unk> .
it lasted till nine o'clock , and disko was thrice heard to chuckle as <name> pitched the split fish into the hold .
" say , you 're <unk> ' ahead <unk> fast , " said <name> , when they ground the knives after the men had turned in .
" there 's somethin ' of a sea tonight , an ' i <name> n't heard you make no remarks on it . "
" too busy , " <name> replied , testing a blade 's edge .
" come to think of it , she is a <unk> . "
the little schooner was <unk> all around her anchor among the <unk> waves .
backing with a start of affected surprise at the sight of the strained cable , she pounced on it like a kitten , while the spray of her descent burst through the <unk> with the report of a gun .
shaking her head , she would say : " well , i 'm sorry i ca n't stay any longer with you .
i 'm going north , " and would <unk> off , halting suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging .
" as i was just going to observe , " she would begin , as gravely as a drunken man addressing a <unk> .
the rest of the sentence ( she acted her words in <unk> , of course ) was lost in a fit of the <unk> , when she behaved like a puppy chewing a string , a clumsy woman in a <unk> , a hen with her head cut off , or a cow stung by a hornet , exactly as the whims of the sea took her .
" see her sayin ' her piece .
she 's <name> <name> naow , " said <name> .
she swung sideways on a roller , and <unk> with her <unk> from port to starboard .
" <unk>  <unk> , give me <name>  er give <unk> ! "
<unk> !
she sat down in the <unk> on the water , <unk> with a flourish of pride impressive enough had not the <unk> <unk> mockingly in its box .
<name> laughed aloud .
" why , it 's just as if she was alive , " he said .
" she 's as <unk> as a <unk> an ' as dry as a <unk> ' , " said <name> , enthusiastically , as he was stung across the deck in a batter of spray .
" <unk> 'em off an <unk> 'em off , an ' 'do n't ye come <unk> me , ' she sez .
look at her  jest look at her !
sakes !
you should see one o ' them <unk> <unk> ' up her anchor on her spike outer <unk> water . "
" what 's a toothpick , <name> ? "
" them new <unk> an ' <unk> .
fine 's a yacht forward , with yacht <unk> to 'em , an ' spike <unk> , an ' a <unk> that u 'd take our hold .
i 've heard that burgess himself he made the models fer three or four of 'em , dad 's sot ag'in ' 'em on account o ' their <unk> ' an' <unk> ' , but there 's heaps o ' money in 'em .
dad can find fish , but he ai n't no ways progressive  he do n't go with the march o ' the times .
they 're <unk> o ' <unk> ' <unk> an ' sech all .
<unk> seed the <unk> o ' gloucester ?
she 's a <name> , ef she is a toothpick . "
" what do they cost , <name> ? "
" hills o ' dollars .
fifteen thousand , <unk> ; more , mebbe .
there's gold-leaf an ' everything you kin think of . "
then to himself , half under his breath " guess i 'd call her <name> s. , too . "
chapter v that was the first of many talks with <name> , who told <name> why he would transfer his dory 's name to the imaginary <unk> <unk> .
<name> heard a good deal about the real <name> at gloucester ; saw a lock of her hair  which <name> , finding fair words of no avail , had " hooked " as she sat in front of him at school that <name>  and a photograph .
<name> was about fourteen years old , with an awful contempt for boys , and had been trampling on <name> 's heart through the <name> .
all this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks , in the dead dark , or in choking fog ; the whining wheel behind them , the climbing deck before , and without , the <unk> , clamorous sea .
once , of course , as the boys came to know each other , there was a fight , which raged from bow to stern till penn came up and separated them , but promised not to tell disko , who thought fighting on watch rather worse than sleeping .
<name> was no match for <name> physically , but it says a great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods .
that was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his elbows and wrists , where the wet jersey and <unk> cut into the flesh .
the salt water stung them unpleasantly , but when they were ripe <name> treated them with disko 's razor , and assured <name> that now he was a " blooded banker " ; the affliction of <unk> being the <name> of the caste that claimed him .
since he was a boy and very busy , he did not bother his head with too much thinking .
he was exceedingly sorry for his mother , and often longed to see her and above all to tell her of his wonderful new life , and how brilliantly he was <unk> himself in it .
otherwise he preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his supposed death .
but one day , as he stood on the fo'c'sle ladder , <unk> the cook , who had accused him and <name> of <unk> fried pies , it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner .
he was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the " we 're here " ; had his place at the table and among the bunks ; and could hold his own in the long talks on <name> days , when the others were always ready to listen to what they called his " <unk> " of his life ashore .
it did not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke of his own life  it seemed very far away  no one except <name> ( and even <name> 's belief was sorely tried ) credited him .
so he invented a friend , a boy he had heard of , who drove a miniature <unk> drag in <unk> , ohio , and ordered five suits of clothes at a time , and led things called " germans " at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen , but all the presents were solid silver .
salters protested that this kind of yarn was desperately wicked , if not indeed positively blasphemous , but he listened as greedily as the others ; and their criticisms at the end gave <name> entirely new notions on " germans , " clothes , cigarettes with gold-leaf tips , rings , watches , scent , small <unk> , champagne , <unk> , and hotel accommodation .
little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his " friend , " whom long <name> had christened " the crazy kid , " " the gilt-edged baby , " " the <unk> ' <unk> , " and other pet names ; and with his <unk> feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported <unk> , to the " friend 's " discredit .
<name> was a very <unk> person , with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him .
before long he knew where disko kept the old <unk> <unk> that they called the " <unk> "  under the <unk> in his bunk .
when he <unk> the sun , and with the help of " the old farmer 's " almanac found the latitude , <name> would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe .
now , the chief engineer of the liner could have done no more , and no engineer of thirty years ' service could have assumed one half of the <unk> air with which <name> , first careful to spit over the side , made public the schooner 's position for that day , and then and not till then relieved disko of the <unk> .
there is an etiquette in all these things .
the said " <unk> , " an <name> chart , the farming almanac , <unk> " coast pilot , " and <unk> 's " navigator " were all the weapons disko needed to guide him , except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye .
<name> nearly slew penn with it when <name> platt taught him first how to " fly the blue pigeon " ; and , though his strength was not equal to continuous sounding in any sort of a sea , for calm weather with a <unk> lead on shoal water disko used him freely .
as <name> said : " 'tai n't <unk> 's dad wants .
it 's samples .
grease her up good , harve . "
<name> would tallow the cup at the end , and carefully bring the sand , shell , <unk> , or whatever it might be , to disko , who fingered and smelt it and gave judgment .
as has been said , when disko thought of cod he thought as a cod ; and by some <unk> mixture of instinct and experience , moved the " we 're here " from berth to berth , always with the fish , as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board .
but disko 's board was the grand bank  a triangle two hundred and fifty miles on each side a waste of wallowing sea , cloaked with dank fog , vexed with gales , harried with drifting ice , scored by the tracks of the reckless liners , and dotted with the sails of the <unk> .
for days they worked in fog  <name> at the <name>  till , grown familiar with the thick airs , he went out with <name> platt , his heart rather in his mouth .
but the fog would not lift , and the fish were biting , and no one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time .
<name> devoted himself to his lines and the <unk> or <unk> as <name> platt called for them ; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the <name> and tom's instinct ; <name> 's <unk> sounding thin and faint beside them .
but it was an unearthly experience , and , for the first time in a month , <name> dreamed of the shifting , smoking floors of water round the dory , the lines that strayed away into nothing , and the air above that melted on the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes .
a few days later he was out with <name> on what should have been <unk> bottom , but the whole length of the <unk> ran out , and still the anchor found nothing , and <name> grew mortally afraid , for that his last touch with earth was lost .
" <unk> , " said <name> , hauling in .
" that is good joke on disko .
come ! "
and he rowed to the schooner to find <name> platt and the others <unk> at the skipper because , for once , he had led them to the edge of the barren <unk> , the blank hole of the grand bank .
they made another berth through the fog , and that time the hair of <unk> head stood up when he went out in <name> 's dory .
a whiteness moved in the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave , and there was a roaring , a plunging , and spouting .
it was his first introduction to the dread summer <unk> of the banks , and he cowered in the bottom of the boat while <name> laughed .
there were days , though , clear and soft and warm , when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf over the <unk> and <unk> the drifting " <unk> " with an oar ; and there were days of light airs , when <name> was taught how to steer the schooner from one berth to another .
it thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his hand on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail <unk> back and forth against the blue sky .
that was magnificent , in spite of disko saying that it would break a snake 's back to follow his wake .
but , as usual , pride ran before a fall .
they were sailing on the wind with the <unk>  an old one , luckily  set , and <name> jammed her right into it to show <name> how completely he had mastered the <name> .
the foresail went over with a bang , and the <unk> stabbed and ripped through the <unk> , which , was of course , prevented from going over by the <unk> .
they lowered the wreck in awful silence , and <name> spent his leisure hours for the next few days under <name> platt 's <name> , learning to use a needle and palm .
<name> hooted with <name> , for , as he said , he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days .
<unk> , <name> imitated all the men by turns , till he had combined disko 's peculiar stoop at the wheel , long <name> 's swinging <unk> when the lines were hauled , <name> 's <unk> but effective stroke in a dory , and <name> platt 's generous ohio stride along the deck .
" 't is beautiful to see how he takes to ut , " said long <name> , when <name> was looking out by the windlass one thick noon .
" i 'll lay my wage an' share 't is more'n half <unk> ' to him , an ' he <unk> himself he's a <unk> mariner .
<unk> his little bit av a back now ! "
" that 's the way we all begin , " said <name> platt .
" the boys they make believe all the time till they 've cheated 'emselves into bein ' men , an' so till they die  <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' .
i done it on the old ohio , i know .
stood my first watch  <unk>  feelin ' <unk> <unk> .
<name> 's full o ' the same kind o ' notions .
see 'em now , actin ' to be <unk> <unk>  every hair a <unk> an ' blood <unk> tar . "
he spoke down the cabin stairs .
" 'guess you 're mistook in your judgments fer once , disko .
what in rome made ye tell us all here the kid was crazy ? "
" he wuz , " disko replied .
" crazy ez a <unk> when he come aboard ; but i'll say he 's sobered up <unk> sence .
i cured him . "
" he yarns good , " said <name> platt .
" t'other night he told us abaout a kid of his own size <unk> ' a <unk> ' little rig an ' four ponies up an' down <unk> , ohio , i think 't was , an ' givin ' suppers to a crowd o' <unk> kids .
<unk> kind o ' <unk> , but blame interestin ' .
he knows scores of 'em . "
" 'guess he strikes 'em <unk> his own head , " disko called from the cabin , where he was busy with the <unk> .
" <unk> to reason that sort is all made up .
it do n't take in no one but <name> , an ' he laughs at it .
i 've heard him , behind my back . "
" <unk> hear what <unk> <name> <unk> said when they whacked up a match <unk> ' his sister <unk> an ' <unk> ' <unk> , an ' the boys put up that joke on him daown to <unk> ? "
drawled uncle salters , who was dripping peaceably under the <name> of the starboard <unk> .
<name> platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence : he was a cape cod man , and had not known that tale more than twenty years .
uncle salters went on with a rasping chuckle : " <unk> <name> <unk> he said , an ' he was jest right , abaout <unk> ' , <unk> on the <unk> , ' he said , 'an ' t'other ha'af blame fool ; an ' they told me she 's married a <unk> man . '
<unk> <name> <unk> he hed n't no roof to his mouth , an ' talked that way . "
" he did n't talk any pennsylvania dutch , " <name> platt replied .
" you'd better leave a cape man to tell that tale .
the <unk> was gipsies <unk> 'way back . "
" wal , i do n't profess to be any <unk> , " salters said .
" i'm comin ' to the moral o ' things .
that 's jest abaout what <unk> harve be !
ha'af on the <unk> , an ' t'other ha'af blame fool ; an ' there 's <unk> believe he 's a <name> man .
yah ! "
" did ye ever think how sweet 'twould be to sail wid a full crew o' <unk> ? "
said long <name> .
" ha'af in the <unk> an ' other ha'af in the <unk> , as <unk> did not say , an ' makes out he 's a fisherman ! "
a little laugh went round at salters 's expense .
disko held his tongue , and wrought over the <unk> that he kept in a <unk> , square hand ; this was the kind of thing that ran on , <name> after soiled <name> : " july 17 .
this day thick fog and few fish .
made berth to northward .
so ends this day .
" july 18 .
this day comes in with thick fog .
caught a few fish .
" july 19 .
this day comes in with light breeze from n. e. and fine weather .
made a berth to eastward .
caught plenty fish .
" july 20 .
this , the sabbath , comes in with fog and light winds .
so ends this day .
total fish caught this week , <unk> . "
they never worked on sundays , but shaved , and washed themselves if it were fine , and pennsylvania sang hymns .
once or twice he suggested that , if it was not an impertinence , he thought he could preach a little .
uncle salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion , reminding him that he was not a preacher and must n't think of such things .
we 'd hev him <unk> ' <unk> next , " salters explained , " an ' what would happen then ? "
so they compromised on his reading aloud from a book called " josephus . "
it was an old <unk> volume , smelling of a hundred voyages , very solid and very like the bible , but <unk> with accounts of battles and sieges ; and they read it nearly from cover to cover .
otherwise penn was a silent little body .
he would not utter a word for three days on end sometimes , though he played <unk> , listened to the songs , and laughed at the stories .
when they tried to stir him up , he would answer .
" i do n't wish to seem <unk> , but it is because i have nothing to say .
my head feels quite empty .
i 've almost forgotten my name . "
he would turn to uncle salters with an expectant smile .
" why , pennsylvania pratt , " salters would shout .
" you 'll <unk> me next ! "
" no  never , " penn would say , shutting his lips firmly .
" pennsylvania pratt , of course , " he would repeat over and over .
sometimes it was uncle salters who forgot , and told him he was <unk> or <name> or <unk> ; but penn was equally content  till next time .
he was always very tender with <name> , whom he pitied both as a lost child and as a lunatic ; and when salters saw that penn liked the boy , he relaxed , too .
salters was not an amiable person ( he esteemed it his business to keep the boys in order ) ; and the first time <name> , in fear and trembling , on a still day , managed to <name> up to the <unk> ( <name> was behind him ready to help ) , he esteemed it his duty to <name> salters 's big <unk> up there  a sight of shame and derision to the nearest schooner .
with disko , <name> took no liberties ; not even when the old man dropped direct orders , and treated him , like the rest of the crew , to " do n't you want to do so and so ? "
and " guess you'd better , " and so forth .
there was something about the clean-shaven lips and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily <unk> to young blood .
disko showed him the meaning of the <unk> and pricked chart , which , he said , laid over any government publication whatsoever ; led him , pencil in hand , from berth to berth over the whole string of banks  <name> have , western , <unk> , st. <name> , green , and grand  talking " cod " meantime .
taught him , too , the principle on which the " <unk> " was worked .
in this <name> excelled <name> , for he had inherited a head for figures , and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen bank sun appealed to all his keen wits .
for other <unk> his age <unk> him .
as disko said , he should have begun when he was ten .
<name> could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark ; and at a pinch , when uncle salters had a <unk> on his palm , could dress down by sense of touch .
he could steer in anything short of half a <name> from the feel of the wind on his face , <unk> the " we 're here " just when she needed it .
these things he did as automatically as he skipped about the rigging , or made his dory a part of his own <name> and body .
but he could not communicate his knowledge to <name> .
still there was a good deal of general information flying about the schooner on <name> days , when they lay up in the fo'c'sle or sat on the cabin lockers , while spare <unk> , leads , and rings rolled and rattled in the pauses of the talk .
disko spoke of whaling voyages in the fifties ; of great <unk> slain beside their young ; of death agonies on the black , tossing seas , and blood that <unk> forty feet in the air ; of boats smashed to splinters ; of patent rockets that went off <unk> and bombarded the trembling crews ; of <unk> and <unk> , and that terrible " nip " of <unk> , when twelve hundred men were made homeless on the ice in three days  wonderful tales , all true .
but more wonderful still were his stories of the cod , and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel .
long <name> 's tastes ran more to the supernatural .
he held them silent with ghastly stories of the " <unk> " on <unk> beach , that mock and terrify lonely <unk> ; of <unk> and <unk> who were never properly buried ; of hidden treasure on fire island guarded by the spirits of kidd 's men ; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over truro township ; of that harbour in maine where no one but a stranger <name> lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their old-fashioned boat , whistling  not calling , but whistling  for the soul of the man who broke their rest .
<name> had a notion that the east coast of his native land , from mount desert south , was populated chiefly by people who took their horses there in the summer and entertained in <unk> with <unk> floors and <unk> <unk> .
he laughed at the <unk> ,  not as much as he would have done a month before ,  but ended by sitting still and shuddering .
<name> platt dealt with his interminable trip round the horn on the old ohio in the flogging days , with a navy more extinct than the dodo  the navy that passed away in the great war .
he told them how red-hot shot are dropped into a cannon , a wad of wet <name> between them and the cartridge ; how they <unk> and reek when they strike wood , and how the little <unk> of the miss <name> <name> hove water over them and shouted to the fort to try again .
and he told tales of blockade  long weeks of swaying at anchor , varied only by the departure and return of steamers that had used up their coal ( there was no change for the <unk> ) ; of gales and cold  cold that kept two hundred men , night and day , pounding and chopping at the ice on cable , blocks , and rigging , when the galley was as red-hot as the fort 's shot , and men drank cocoa by the bucket .
<name> platt had no use for steam .
his service closed when that thing was comparatively new .
he admitted that it was a <unk> invention in time of peace , but looked hopefully for the day when sails should come back again on <unk> <unk> with <unk> booms .
<name> 's talk was slow and gentle  all about pretty girls in madeira washing clothes in the dry beds of streams , by moonlight , under waving bananas ; legends of saints , and tales of queer dances or fights away in the cold newfoundland <unk> .
salters was mainly agricultural ; for , though he read " josephus " and expounded it , his mission in life was to prove the value of green <unk> , and specially of clover , against every form of phosphate whatsoever .
he grew <unk> about <unk> ; he dragged greasy " orange judd " books from his bunk and <unk> them , wagging his finger at <name> , to whom it was all greek .
little penn was so genuinely pained when <name> made fun of <unk> lectures that the boy gave it up , and suffered in polite silence .
that was very good for <name> .
the cook naturally did not join in these conversations .
as a rule , he spoke only when it was absolutely necessary ; but at times a queer gift of speech descended on him , and he held forth , half in <unk> , half in broken english , an hour at a time .
he was specially communicative with the boys , and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day <name> would be <name> 's master , and that he would see it .
he told them of <unk> in the <name> up cape <unk> way , of the <unk> that goes to <unk> , and of the <unk> arctic , that breaks the ice between the mainland and <name> <name> island .
then he told them stories that his mother had told him , of life far to the southward , where water never froze ; and he said that when he died his soul would go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving above .
that seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never seen a palm in his life .
then , too , regularly at each meal , he would ask <name> , and <name> alone , whether the cooking was to his taste ; and this always made the " second half " laugh .
yet they had a great respect for the cook 's judgment , and in their hearts considered <name> something of a <unk> by consequence .
and while <name> was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and hard health with every gulp of the good air , the " we 're here " went her ways and did her business on the bank , and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> fish mounted higher and higher in the hold .
no one day's work was out of the common , but the average days were many and close together .
naturally , a man of disko 's reputation was closely watched  " <unk> upon , " <name> called it  by his neighbours , but he had a very pretty knack of giving them the slip through the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
disko avoided company for two reasons .
he wished to make his own experiments , in the first place ; and in the second , he objected to the mixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations .
the bulk of them were mainly gloucester boats , with a scattering from <unk> , harwich , chatham , and some of the maine ports , but the crews <name> from goodness knows where .
risk breeds recklessness , and when greed is added there are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet , which , like a mob of sheep , is huddled round some <unk> leader .
" let the two <unk> lead 'em , " said disko .
" we 're <unk> to lay among 'em fer a spell on the eastern shoals ; though ef luck holds , we won't hev to lay long .
where we are naow , harve , ai n't considered <unk> good <unk> . "
" ai n't it ? "
said <name> , who was drawing water ( he had learned just how to <unk> the bucket ) , after an unusually long <unk> .
" should n't mind striking some poor ground for a change , then . "
" all the <unk> i want to see  do n't want to strike her  is eastern point , " said <name> .
" say , dad , it looks 's if we would n't hev to lay more'n two weeks on the shoals .
you 'll meet all the comp'ny you want then , harve .
that 's the time we begin to work .
no reg'lar meals fer no one then .
<unk> when ye 're hungry , an ' sleep when ye ca n't keep awake .
good job you was n't picked up a month later than you was , or we 'd never <name> ' had you dressed in shape fer the old virgin . "
<name> understood from the <name> chart that the old virgin and a nest of curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise , and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there .
but seeing the size of the virgin ( it was one <name> <name> ) , he wondered how even disko with the <unk> and the lead could find her .
he learned later that disko was entirely equal to that and any other business , and could even help others .
a big <unk> <unk> <name> in the cabin , and <name> never understood the need of it till , after some blinding thick days , they heard the <unk> tooting of a <unk> fog-horn  a machine whose note is as that of a <unk> elephant .
they were making a short berth , towing the anchor under their foot to save trouble .
" <unk> <unk> ' fer his latitude , " said long <name> .
the dripping red <unk> of a bark glided out of the fog , and the " we 're here " rang her <name> thrice , using sea shorthand .
the larger boat backed her <unk> with shrieks and shoutings .
" frenchman , " said uncle salters , scornfully .
" <unk> boat from st .
<unk> . "
the farmer had a <unk> <unk> .
" i 'm most outer <unk> , too , disko . "
" same here , " said <name> platt .
" hi !
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> !
<unk> <unk> , you <unk> <unk> !
where you from  st. <unk> , eh ? "
ah , <name> !
<unk> <unk> !
oui !
oui !
<unk> <unk>  st. <unk> !
st. <name> et <unk> , " cried the other crowd , waving woollen caps and laughing .
then all together , " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
" bring up the board , <name> .
beats me how them frenchmen fetch anywheres , <unk> ' <name> 's <unk> broadly .
forty-six <unk> good enough fer them ; an ' i guess it 's abaout right , too . "
<name> chalked the figures on the board , and they <name> it in the <unk> to a chorus of <unk> from the bark .
" seems kinder <unk> to let 'em <unk> off like this , " salters suggested , feeling in his pockets .
" hev ye learned french then sence last trip ' ? "
said disko .
" i don't want no more <unk> hove at us 'long o ' your calm ' <unk> boats <unk> cochins , ' same 's you did off <name> have . "
" <unk> rush he said that was the way to rise 'em .
plain united states is good enough fer me .
we 're all <unk> short on <unk> .
young feller , do n't you speak french ? "
" oh , yes , " said <name> , valiantly ; and he bawled : " hi !
say !
<unk> vous !
<unk> !
nous <unk> <unk> pour <unk> . "
" ah , <unk> , <unk> ! "
they cried , and laughed again .
" that hit 'em .
let 's heave a dory over , anyway , " said <name> platt .
" i do n't exactly hold no certificates on french , but i know another lingo that goes , i guess .
come on , harve , an ' interpret . "
the raffle and confusion when he and <name> were hauled up the <unk> black side was indescribable .
her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured prints of the virgin  the virgin of newfoundland , they called her .
<name> found his french of no recognised bank brand , and his conversation was limited to nods and grins .
but <name> platt waved his arms and got along <unk> .
the captain gave him a drink of unspeakable gin , and the <unk> crew , with their hairy throats , red caps , and long knives , greeted him as a brother .
then the trade began .
they had tobacco , plenty of it  american , that had never paid duty to <name> .
they wanted chocolate and crackers .
<name> rowed back to arrange with the cook and disko , who owned the stores , and on his return the <unk> and <unk> were counted out by the frenchman 's wheel .
it looked like a piratical division of loot ; but <name> platt came out of it roped with black <unk> and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco .
then those jovial mariners swung off into the mist , and the last <name> heard was a <name> chorus : " par <unk> chez <name> <unk> , il y a <name> bois <unk> , et <name> <unk> y <name> et <name> <unk> et la <unk> ... que <unk> vous , <name> , qui <unk> <unk> ?
je <unk> <unk> , <unk> et saint <name> . "
" how was it my french did n't go , and your <unk> did ? "
<name> demanded when the barter had been distributed among the " we 're <unk> " .
" <unk> ! "
platt <unk> .
" well , yes , 't was <unk> , but a heap <unk> your french , harve .
them french boats are <unk> o' <unk> , an ' that 's why . "
" are you a <unk> , then ? "
" looks that way , do n't it ? "
said the <unk> 's man , stuffing his pipe ; and <name> had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon .
chapter <name> the thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which some craft loafed about the broad atlantic .
<unk> , as <name> said , were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their neighbours ; but one expected better things of steamers .
that was after another interesting interview , when they had been chased for three miles by a big lumbering old <unk> , all boarded over on the upper deck , that smelt like a thousand <unk> .
a very excited officer yelled at them through a <unk> , and she lay and <unk> helplessly on the water while disko ran the " we 're here " under her <name> and gave the skipper a piece of his mind .
" where might ye be  eh ?
ye do n't deserve to be anywheres .
you <unk> tramps go <unk> ' the road on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours , an' your eyes in your <unk> instid o ' in your silly heads . "
at this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about disko 's own eyes .
" we have n't had an observation for three days .
d'you suppose we can run her blind ? "
he shouted .
" <unk> , i can , " disko retorted .
" what 's come to your lead ' ?
et it ' ?
ca n't ye smell bottom , or are them cattle too rank ? "
" what d 'ye feed 'em ? "
said uncle salters with intense seriousness , for the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him .
" they say they fall off <unk> on a <unk> .
dunno as it 's any o ' my business , but i 've a kind o ' notion that <unk> broke small an ' sprinkled  " " thunder ! "
said a <unk> in a red jersey as he looked over the side .
" what asylum did they let his whiskers out of ? "
" young feller , " salters began , standing up in the <unk> , " let me tell yeou 'fore we go any further that i 've  " the officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness .
" excuse me , " he said , " but i 've asked for my reckoning .
if the agricultural person with the hair <name> kindly shut his head , the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> may perhaps condescend to enlighten us . "
" naow you 've made a show o ' me , salters , " said disko , angrily .
he could not stand up to that particular sort of talk , and snapped out the latitude and longitude without more lectures .
" 'well , <unk> 's a <unk> of lunatics , sure , " said the skipper , as he rang up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the schooner .
" of all the blamed fools , next to you , salters , him an ' his crowd are abaout the <unk> i 've ever seen , " said disko as the " we 're here " slid away .
" i was jest givin ' him my <unk> on <unk> ' round these waters like a lost child , an ' you must cut in with your fool <unk> ' .
ca n't ye never keep things <unk> ? "
<name> , <name> , and the others stood back , winking one to the other and full of <name> ; but disko and salters <unk> seriously till evening , salters arguing that a <unk> was practically a barn on blue water , and disko insisting that , even if this were the case , decency and <unk> demanded that he should have kept " things <unk> . "
long <name> stood it in silence for a time ,  an angry skipper makes an unhappy crew ,  and then he spoke across the table after supper : " fwhat 's the good o ' <unk> ' fwhat they 'll say ? "
said he .
" they 'll tell that tale ag'in ' us fer years  that 's all , " said disko .
" <unk> sprinkled ! "
" with salt , o ' course , " said salters , <unk> , reading the farming reports from a <unk> new york paper .
" it 's plumb <unk> ' to all my feelin 's , " the skipper went on .
" ca n't see ut that way , " said long <name> , the <unk> .
" look at here , disko !
is there another packet afloat this day in this weather <unk> <name> ' met a tramp an ' , over an ' above givin ' her her <unk> ' ,  over an' above that , i say ,  <unk> 'd <name> ' <unk> wid her quite intelligent on the management av steers an ' such at sea ' ?
forgit ut !
av coorse they <name> not .
't was the most <unk> conversation that iver <unk> .
double game an ' twice runnin '  all to us . "
<name> kicked <name> under the table , and <name> choked in his cup .
" 'well , " said salters , who felt that his honour had been somewhat plastered , " i said i did n't know as <unk> any business o ' mine , 'fore i spoke . "
" an ' right there , " said <name> platt , experienced in discipline and etiquette  " right there , i take it , disko , you should <name> ' asked him to stop ef the conversation wuz likely , in your <unk> , to be anyways  what it should n't . "
" dunno but that 's so , " said disko , who saw his way to an honourable retreat from a fit of the dignities .
" 'why , o ' course it was so , " said salters , " you bein ' skipper here ; an' i 'd cheerful hev stopped on a hint  not from any <unk> ' or conviction , but fer the sake o ' bearin ' an example to these two blame boys of <unk> . "
" did n't i tell you , harve , 'twould come araound to us 'fore we 'd done ' ?
always those blame boys .
but i would n't have missed the show fer a <unk> in a <unk> , " <name> whispered .
" still , things should <name> ' been kep ' <unk> , " said disko , and the light of new argument lit in salters 's eye as he crumbled cut plug into his pipe .
" there 's a power av <unk> in keepin ' things <unk> , " said long <name> , intent on <unk> the storm .
" that 's fwhat <unk> of <unk> and hare 's <unk> when he sent counahan fer skipper on the <unk> d. <unk> , instid o ' cap .
<name> that was took with <unk> rheumatism an' could n't go .
counahan the navigator we called him . "
" <name> counahan he never went aboard fer a night 'thout a pond o ' rum somewheres in the manifest , " said <name> platt , playing up to the lead .
" he used to <unk> araound the <unk> houses to boston lookin ' fer the lord to make him captain of a <unk> on his merits .
<name> <name> , up to atlantic <unk> , give him his board free fer a year or more on account of his stories .
counahan the navigator !
<unk> !
<unk> !
dead these fifteen year , ai n't he ? "
" seventeen , i guess .
he died the year the caspar <unk> was built ; but he could niver keep things <unk> .
<unk> tuk him fer the reason the thief tuk the hot stove  bekaze there was nothin ' else that season .
the men was all to the banks , and counahan he whacked up an <unk> hard crowd fer crew .
rum !
ye <unk> 'd <name> ' floated the <unk> , insurance and all , in fwhat they stowed aboard her .
they lef ' boston harbour for the great grand bank wid a roarin ' <unk> behind 'em an ' all hands full to the bung .
an ' the <unk> looked after thim , for divil a watch did they set , an ' divil a rope did they lay hand to , till they 'd seen the bottom av a <unk> cask o ' <unk> .
that was about <name> week , so far as counahan remembered .
( if ' i <unk> 'd only tell the tale as he told ut ! )
all that whoile the wind blew like ould <name> , an ' the <unk>  't was summer , and they 'd give her a <unk>  struck her gait and kept ut .
then counahan tuk the <unk> an ' <unk> over it for a whoile , an ' made out , <unk> ' that an ' the chart an ' the <unk> in his head , that they was to the <unk> o ' sable island , <unk> along glorious , but speakin ' nothin ' .
then they broached another keg , an ' quit <unk> ' about anythin ' fer another spell .
the <unk> she lay down whin she dropped boston light , and she never <unk> her <unk> up to that time  <unk> ' on one an ' the same slant .
but they saw no weed , nor gulls , nor schooners ; an ' <unk> they <unk> they 'd been out a matter o ' fourteen days , and they mistrusted the bank had <unk> payment .
so they sounded , an ' got sixty fathom .
<unk> me , ' sez counahan .
'that 's me <unk> time !
i 've run her <unk> on the bank fer you , an ' when we get thirty fathom we 'll turn in like little men .
counahan is the <unk> , ' sez he .
<unk> the navigator ! '
" nex ' cast they got ninety .
sez counahan : <unk> the <unk> 's tuk too <unk> ' or else the bank 's sunk . '
" they hauled ut up , bein ' just about in that state when ut seemed right an ' reasonable , and sat down on the deck <unk> ' the knots , an' gettin ' her snarled up <unk> .
the <unk> she 'd struck her gait , and she hild ut , an ' <unk> along come a tramp , an ' counahan spoke her .
" <unk> ye seen any <unk> now ? '
sez he , quite casual .
" 'there 's <unk> 's av them off the <name> coast , ' sez the tramp .
" <unk> !
go shake yerself , ' sez counahan .
'fwhat have i to do wid the <name> coast ? '
" 'then fwhat are ye doin ' here ? '
sez the tramp .
" <unk> ' christianity ! '
sez counahan ( he always said that whin his pumps sucked an ' he was not feelin ' good )  <unk> ' christianity ! '
he sez , 'where am i at ? '
" <unk> mile <unk> o ' cape clear , ' sez the tramp , 'if that 's any consolation to you . '
" counahan fetched <name> jump , four feet <unk> inches , measured by the cook .
" <unk> ! '
sez he , bould ez brass .
' d 'ye take me fer a dialect ?
thirty-five mile from cape clear , an ' fourteen days from boston light .
<unk> ' christianity , 't is a record , an ' by the same token i 've a mother to <unk> ! '
think av ut !
the gall av um !
but ye see he could niver keep things <unk> .
" the crew was mostly cork an ' <name> men , barrin ' one <unk> that wanted to go back , but they called him a mutineer , an ' they ran the ould <unk> into <unk> , an ' they had an <unk> time <unk> around with <unk> on the ould sod fer a week .
thin they wint back , an' it cost 'em two an ' thirty days to beat to the banks again .
't was gettin ' on towards fall , and grub was low , so counahan ran her back to boston , wid no more bones to ut . "
" and what did the firm say ? "
<name> demanded .
" fwhat could they ' ?
the fish was on the banks , an ' counahan was at <unk> talkin ' av his record trip east !
they tuk their satisfaction out av that , an ' ut all came av not keepin ' the crew and the rum <unk> in the first place ; an ' <unk> ' <unk> wid <unk> , in the second .
counahan the navigator , rest his sowl !
he was an <unk> citizen !
" once i was in the <name> holmes , " said <name> , in his gentle voice .
" they not want any of her <unk> in gloucester .
eh , wha-at ?
give us no price .
so we go across the water , and think to sell to some fayal man .
then it blow fresh , and we can not see well .
eh , wha-at ?
then it blow some more fresh , and we go down below and drive very fast  no one know where .
by-and-by we see a land , and it get some hot .
then come two , three nigger in a brick .
eh , wha-at ?
we ask where we are , and they say  now , what you all think ? "
" grand canary , " said disko , after a moment .
<name> shook his head , smiling .
" blanco , " said <name> platt .
" no .
worse than that .
we was below <unk> , and the brick she was from <unk> !
so we sell our <unk> there !
not bad , so ?
eh , wha-at ? "
" can a schooner like this go right across to africa ? "
said <name> .
" go araound the horn ef there 's anythin ' worth goin ' fer , and the grub holds aout , " said disko .
" my father he run his packet , an ' she was a kind o ' <unk> , abaout fifty ton , i guess ,  the <name> ,  he run her over to greenland 's icy mountains the year ha'af our fleet was <unk> after cod there .
an ' what 's more , he took my mother along with him ,  to show her haow the money was earned , i <unk> ,  an ' they was all iced up , an ' i was born at disko .
do n't remember nothin ' abaout it , o' course .
we come back when the ice eased in the spring , but they named me fer the place .
kinder mean trick to put up on a baby , but we 're all <unk> to make mistakes in <unk> lives . "
" sure !
sure ! "
said salters , wagging his head .
" all <unk> to make mistakes , an ' i tell you two boys here thet after you 've made a mistake  ye do n't make <unk> a hundred a day  the next best <unk> to own up to it like men . "
long <name> winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except disko and salters , and the incident was closed .
then they made berth after berth to the northward , the dories out almost every day , running along the east edge of the grand bank in <unk> <unk> water , and fishing steadily .
it was here <name> first met the <unk> , who is one of the best <unk> , but uncertain in his moods .
they were waked out of their bunks one black night by yells of " <unk> o ! "
from salters , and for an hour and a half every soul aboard <name> over his <unk>  a piece of lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like <unk> umbrella ribs .
the <unk>  for some unknown reason  likes , and wraps himself round , this thing , and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins .
but as he leaves his home he <unk> first water and next ink into his <unk> 's face ; and it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot .
they were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended ; but a pile of fresh <unk> lay on the deck , and the large cod thinks very well of a little shiny piece of <unk> at the tip of a <unk> hook .
next day they caught many fish , and met the <name> pitman , to whom they shouted their luck , and she wanted to trade  seven cod for one fair-sized <unk> ; but disko would not agree at the price , and the <name> dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away , in the <name> of striking on to some for herself .
disko said nothing till after supper , when he sent <name> and <name> out to buoy the " we 're here 's " cable and announced his intention of turning in with the <unk> .
<name> naturally repeated these remarks to a dory from the <name> , who wanted to know why they were <unk> their cable , since they were not on <name> bottom .
" dad sez he would n't trust a ferryboat within five mile o ' you , " <name> howled cheerfully .
" why do n't he git out , then ' ?
who 's <unk> ' ? "
said the other .
" cause you 've jest the same ez <unk> him , an ' he do n't take that from any boat , not to speak o ' sech a <unk> ' <unk> as you be . "
" she ai n't <unk> ' any this trip , " said the man , angrily , for the <name> pitman had an <unk> reputation for breaking her <unk> .
" then haow d'you make berths ? "
said <name> .
" it 's her best p'int o' <unk> ' .
an ' ef she 's quit <unk> ' , what in thunder are you doin ' with a new <unk> ? "
that shot went home .
" hey , you <unk> <unk> , take your monkey back to gloucester .
go back to school , <name> troop , " was the answer .
" <unk> !
<unk> ! "
yelled <name> , who knew that one of the <unk> crew had worked in an <unk> factory the <name> before .
" <unk> !
gloucester <unk> !
git aout , you <unk> ! "
to call a gloucester man a <name> <unk> is not well received .
<name> answered in kind .
" <unk> yourself , ye <unk> !
ye chatham <unk> ' git aout with your brick in your stock in ' ! "
and the forces separated , but chatham had the worst of it .
" i knew haow 'twould be , " said disko .
" she 's <unk> the wind <unk> already .
some one <unk> put a <unk> on thet packet .
she 'll snore till midnight , an ' jest when we 're gittin ' our sleep she 'll strike adrift .
good job we ai n't crowded with craft <unk> .
but i ain't goin ' to up anchor fer chatham .
she may hold . "
the wind , which had hauled round , rose at sundown and blew steadily .
there was not enough sea , though , to disturb even a dory 's tackle , but the <name> pitman was a law unto herself .
at the end of the boys ' watch they heard the <unk> of a huge <unk> revolver aboard her .
" <name> , <name> , <unk> ! "
<name> <name> .
" here she comes , dad ; <unk> first , walkin ' in her sleep same 's she done on <unk> . "
had she been any other boat disko would have taken his chances , but now he cut the cable as the <name> pitman , with all the north atlantic to play in , lurched down directly upon them .
the " we 're here " , under jib and <unk> , gave her no more room than was absolutely necessary ,  disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his cable ,  but scuttled up into the wind as the <name> passed within easy hail , a silent and angry boat , at the <name> of a raking broadside of bank chaff .
" good evenin ' , " said disko , raising his headgear , " an ' haow does your garden grow ? "
" go to ohio an ' hire a mule , " said uncle salters .
" we do n't want no farmers here . "
" <name> i lend you my <unk> ? "
cried long <name> .
" <unk> your rudder an ' stick it in the mud , " said <name> platt .
" say ! "
<name> 's voice rose shrill and high , as he stood on the <unk> .
" <unk> !
is there a strike in the <unk> factory ; or hev they hired girls , ye <unk> ? "
" <unk> out the <unk> , " cried <name> , " and nail 'em to the bottom . "
that was a <unk> jest he had been put up to by <name> platt .
<name> leaned over the stern and yelled ; " <name> <name> play the organ !
<unk> ! "
he flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of unspeakable contempt and derision , while little penn covered himself with <name> by piping up : " gee a little !
<unk> !
come here .
<unk> ! "
they rode on their chain for the rest of the night , a short , <unk> , uneasy motion , as <name> found , and wasted half the forenoon recovering the cable .
but the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of triumph and <name> , and they thought with grief over all the beautiful things that they might have said to the discomfited <name> .
chapter vii next day they fell in with more sails , all circling slowly from the east northerly towards the west .
but just when they expected to make the shoals by the virgin the fog shut down , and they anchored , surrounded by the <unk> of invisible bells .
there was not much fishing , but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news .
that night , a little before <name> , <name> and <name> , who had been sleeping most of the day , tumbled out to " hook " fried pies .
there was no reason why they should not have taken them openly ; but they tasted better so , and it made the cook angry .
the heat and smell below drove them on deck with their plunder , and they found disko at the <name> , which he handed over to <name> .
" keep her goin ' , " said he .
" i mistrust i hear somethin ' .
ef it's anything , i 'm best where i am so 's to get at things . "
it was a forlorn little jingle ; the thick air seemed to pinch it off ; and in the pauses <name> heard the muffled shriek of a liner 's siren , and he knew enough of the banks to know what that meant .
it came to him , with horrible distinctness , how a boy in a <unk> jersey  he despised fancy <unk> now with all a <unk> contempt  how an ignorant , <unk> boy had once said it would be " great " if a steamer ran down a <unk> .
that boy had a state-room with a hot and cold bath , and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a gilt-edged <name> of fare .
and that same boy  no , his very much older brother  was up at four of the dim <name> in streaming , crackling <unk> , hammering , literally for the dear life , on a <name> smaller than the steward 's <unk> , while somewhere close at hand a <unk> steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour !
the bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry , <unk> cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast .
so <name> rang the <name> .
" yes , they slow daown one turn o ' their blame propeller , " said <name> , applying himself to <name> 's <unk> , " fer to keep inside the law , an' that 's <unk> ' when we 're all at the bottom .
hark to her ' she 's a <unk> ! "
" <unk>  <unk>  <unk> ! "
went the siren .
" <unk>  tingle  <unk> , " went the <name> .
" <unk>  ouch ! "
went the <unk> , while sea and sky were all <unk> up in milky fog .
then <name> felt that he was near a moving body , and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a <unk> bow , leaping , it seemed , directly over the schooner .
a <unk> little feather of water curled in front of it , and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of <name> <unk>  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so forth  on a <unk> , gleaming side .
it tilted forward and downward with a <unk> " <unk> " ; the ladder disappeared ; a line of <unk> <unk> flashed past ; a jet of steam puffed in <name> 's helplessly uplifted hands ; a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the " we 're here " , and the little schooner staggered and shook in a rush of <unk> water , as a liner 's stern vanished in the fog .
<name> got ready to faint or be sick , or both , when he heard a crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk , and , all small in his ear , a far-away telephone voice drawling : " heave to !
you 've sunk us ! "
" is it us ? "
he gasped .
" no !
boat out yonder .
ring !
we 're goin ' to look , " said <name> , running out a dory .
in half a minute all except <name> , penn , and the cook were overside and away .
presently a schooner 's <unk> , snapped clean across , drifted past the bows .
then an empty green dory came by , knocking on the 'we 're here 's ' side , as though she wished to be taken in .
then followed something , face down , in a blue jersey , but it was not the whole of a man .
penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click .
<name> pounded despairingly at the <name> , for he feared they might be sunk at any minute , and he jumped at <name> 's hail as the crew came back .
" the <name> <unk> , " said <name> , hysterically , " cut clean in half  <unk> up an ' <unk> on at that !
not a quarter of a mile away .
dad 's got the old man .
there ai n't any one else , and  there was his son , too .
oh , harve , harve , i ca n't stand it !
i 've seen  " he dropped his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a <unk> man aboard .
" what did you pick me up for ? "
the stranger groaned .
" disko , what did you pick me up for ? "
disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder , for the man 's eyes were wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew .
then up and spoke pennsylvania pratt , who was also <unk> or <name> or <unk> when uncle salters forgot ; and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to the countenance of an old , wise man , and he said in a strong voice : " the lord gave , and the lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the lord !
i was  i am a minister of the gospel .
leave him to me . "
" oh , you be , be you ? "
said the man .
" then pray my son back to me !
pray back a <unk> boat an ' a thousand <unk> of fish .
if you 'd left me alone my widow could <name> ' gone on to the <unk> an' worked fer her board , an ' never known  an ' never known .
now i 'll hev to tell her . "
" there ai n't nothin ' to say , " said disko .
" better lie down a piece , <name> <unk> . "
when a man has lost his only son , his summer 's work , and his means of livelihood , in thirty counted seconds , it is hard to give consolation .
" all gloucester men , was n't they , " said <name> platt , fiddling helplessly with a <unk> .
" oh , that do n't make no odds , " said <name> , wringing the wet from his beard .
" i 'll be <unk> ' summer boarders araound east gloucester this fall . "
he rolled heavily to the rail , singing .
" happy birds that sing and fly round thine altars , o most high ! "
" come with me .
come below ! "
said penn , as though he had a right to give orders .
their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute .
" i dunno who you be , but i 'll come , " said <name> , <unk> .
" mebbe i 'll get back some o ' the  some o ' the  nine thousand dollars . "
penn led him into the cabin and slid the door behind .
" that ai n't penn , " cried uncle salters .
" it 's <name> boiler , an '  he's remembered <unk> !
i never seed such eyes in any livin ' man 's head .
what 's to do naow ?
what 'll i do naow ? "
they could hear penn 's voice and <name> 's together .
then penn 's went on alone , and salters slipped off his hat , for penn was praying .
presently the little man came up the steps , huge drops of sweat on his face , and looked at the crew .
<name> was still sobbing by the wheel .
" he do n't know us , " salters groaned .
" it 's all to do over again , <unk> and everything  an ' what 'll he say to me ? "
penn spoke ; they could hear that it was to strangers .
" i have prayed , " said he .
" our people believe in prayer .
i have prayed for the life of this man 's son .
mine were drowned before my eyes  she and my eldest and  the others .
shall a man be more wise than his maker ?
i prayed never for their lives , but i have prayed for this man 's son , and he <name> surely be sent him . "
salters looked pleadingly at penn to see if he remembered .
" how long have i been mad ? "
penn asked suddenly .
his mouth was twitching .
" pshaw , penn !
you were n't never mad , " salters began .
" only a little distracted like . "
" i saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out .
i do not remember any more .
how long ago is that ? "
" i ca n't stand it !
i ca n't stand it ! "
cried <name> , and <name> whimpered in sympathy .
" abaout five year , " said disko , in a shaking voice .
" then i have been a charge on some one for every day of that time .
who was the man ? "
disko pointed to salters .
" ye <name> n't  ye <name> n't ! "
cried the <unk> , twisting his hands together .
" ye 've more'n earned your keep <unk> ; an ' there 's money <unk> ' you , penn , besides ha'af o ' my <unk> in the boat , which is yours fer value received . "
" you are good men .
i can see that in your faces .
but  " " mother av <name> , " whispered long <name> , " an ' he 's been wid us all these trips !
he 's clean bewitched . "
a schooner 's <name> struck up alongside , and a voice hailed through the fog : " o disko !
<unk> abaout the <name> <unk> ? "
" they have found his son , " cried penn .
" stand you still and see the salvation of the lord ! "
" got <name> aboard here , " disko answered , but his voice <unk> .
" there  war n't any one else ? "
" we 've <unk> one , though .
<unk> acrost him snarled up in a mess o' lumber thet might <name> ' bin a fo'c'sle .
his head 's cut some . "
" who is he ? "
the " we 're <unk> ' " <unk> answered one another .
" guess it 's young <unk> , " the voice drawled .
penn raised his hands and said something in <name> .
<name> could have sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face ; but the drawl went on : " <unk> !
you fellers <unk> us <unk> t'other night . "
" we do n't feel like <unk> ' any now , " said disko .
" i know it ; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder  kinder <unk> when we run ag'in ' young <unk> . "
it was the irrepressible <name> pitman , and a roar of unsteady laughter went up from the deck of the " we 're here " .
" hed n't you <unk> 's well send the old man aboard ?
we 're runnin ' in fer more bait an ' <unk> .
'guess you wo n't want him , anyway , an' this blame windlass work makes us <unk> .
we 'll take care of him .
he married my woman 's aunt . "
" i 'll give you anything in the boat , " said troop .
" do n't want nothin ' , 'less , mebbe , an anchor that 'll hold .
say !
young <unk> 's gittin ' kinder <unk> an ' excited .
send the old man along . "
penn waked him from his stupor of despair , and <name> platt rowed him over .
he went away without a word of thanks , not knowing what was to come ; and the fog closed over all .
" and now , " said penn , drawing a deep breath as though about to preach .
" and now "  the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the scabbard ; the light faded from the <unk> eyes ; the voice returned to its usual pitiful little titter  " and now , " said pennsylvania pratt , " do you think it 's too early for a little game of <unk> , mr .
salters ? "
" the very thing  the very thing i was goin ' to say myself , " cried salters , promptly .
" it beats all , penn , how you git on to what 's in a man 's mind . "
the little fellow blushed and meekly followed salters forward .
" up anchor !
hurry !
let 's quit these crazy waters , " shouted disko , and never was he more swiftly obeyed .
" now what in creation d 'ye suppose is the meanin ' o ' that all ? "
said long <name> , when they were working through the fog once more , damp , dripping , and bewildered .
" the way i sense it , " said disko , at the wheel , " is this : the <name> <unk> business comin ' on an empty stummick  " " he  we saw one of them go by , " sobbed <name> .
" an ' that , o ' course , kinder hove him outer water , <unk> runnin ' a craft ashore ; hove him right aout , i take it , to <unk> ' <unk> an ' <name> boiler an ' <unk> reminiscences .
well , <unk> ' <name> there held him up a piece , same 's <unk> ' up a boat .
then , bein ' weak , them props slipped an ' slipped , an ' he <unk> down the ways , an ' naow he 's <unk> ag'in .
that 's haow i sense it . "
they decided that disko was entirely correct .
" 'twould <name> ' bruk salters all up , " said long <name> , " if penn had stayed <name> <unk> ' .
did ye see his face when penn asked who he 'd been charged on all these years ' ?
how is ut , salters ? "
" asleep  dead asleep .
turned in like a child , " salters replied , tiptoeing aft .
" there wo n't be no grub till he wakes , natural .
did ye ever see sech a gift in prayer ?
he <unk> <unk> young <unk> outer the ocean .
thet 's my belief .
<name> was <unk> <unk> of his boy , an ' i mistrusted all along 't was a <unk> on <unk> ' vain idols . "
" there 's others jest as sot , " said disko .
" that 's <unk> , " salters retorted quickly .
" penn 's not all <unk> , an ' i ai n't only but doin ' my duty by him . "
they waited , those hungry men , three hours , till penn reappeared with a smooth face and a blank mind .
he said he believed that he had been dreaming .
then he wanted to know why they were so silent , and they could not tell him .
disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days ; and when they could not go out , turned them into the hold to stack the ship 's stores into smaller compass , to make more room for the fish .
the packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the fo'c'sle stove ; and disko showed how there is great <name> in stowing cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft .
the crew were thus kept lively till they recovered their spirits ; and <name> was tickled with a rope 's end by long <name> for being , as the galway man said , " sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat could n't be helped . "
he did a great deal of thinking in those dreary days ; and told <name> what he thought , and <name> agreed with him  even to the extent of asking for fried pies instead of <unk> them .
but a week later the two nearly upset the <name> s. in a wild attempt to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick .
the grim brute rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish , and between the three of them it was a <name> they all got off alive .
at last , after playing <unk> in the fog , there came a morning when disko shouted down the fo'c'sle : " hurry , boys !
we 're in <unk> ! "
chapter viii to the end of his days , <name> <name> never forget that sight .
the sun was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week , and his low red light struck into the <unk> of three fleets of anchored schooners  one to the north , one to the westward , and one to the south .
there must have been nearly a hundred of them , of every possible make and build , with , far away , a <unk> frenchman , all bowing and <unk> one to the other .
from every boat dories were dropping away like bees from a crowded hive ; and the clamour of voices , the rattling of ropes and blocks , and the splash of the oars carried for miles across the heaving water .
the sails turned all colours , black , <unk> , and white , as the sun mounted ; and more boats swung up through the mists to the southward .
the dories gathered in clusters , separated , reformed , and broke again , all heading one way ; while men hailed and whistled and <unk> and sang , and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard .
" it 's a town , " said <name> .
" disko was right .
it is a town ! "
" i 've seen smaller , " said disko .
" there 's about a thousand men here ; an ' yonder 's the virgin . "
he pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea , where there were no dories .
the " we 're here " skirted round the northern squadron , disko waving his hand to friend after friend , and anchored as neatly as a racing yacht at the end of the season .
the bank fleet pass good <unk> in silence ; but a <unk> is jeered all along the line .
" jest in time fer the <unk> , " cried the <name> <unk> .
" <unk> 'most wet ? "
asked the king <name> .
" hey , <name> platt !
come t ' supper to-night ? "
said the <name> <name> ; and so questions and answers flew back and forth .
men had met one another before , <unk> in the fog , and there is no place for gossip like the bank fleet .
they all seemed to know about <name> 's rescue , and asked if he were worth his salt yet .
the young <unk> <unk> with <name> , who had a lively tongue of his own , and inquired after their health by the town  nicknames they least liked .
<name> 's countrymen <unk> at him in their own language ; and even the silent cook was seen riding the <unk> and shouting <unk> to a friend as black as himself .
after they had buoyed the cable  all around the virgin is <name> bottom , and carelessness means chafed <unk> and danger from drifting  after they had buoyed the cable , their dories went forth to join the mob of boats anchored about a mile away .
the schooners rocked and dipped at a safe distance , like mother ducks watching their brood , while the dories behaved like <unk> <unk> .
as they drove into the confusion , boat banging boat , <name> 's ears tingled at the comments on his rowing .
every dialect from labrador to long island , with portuguese , neapolitan , <unk> <unk> , french , and <unk> , with songs and shoutings and new oaths , rattled round him , and he seemed to be the butt of it all .
for the first time in his life he felt shy  perhaps that came from living so long with only the " we're <unk> "  among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the reeling small craft .
a gentle , breathing swell , three <unk> from trough to barrel , would quietly shoulder up a string of variously painted dories .
they <name> for an instant , a wonderful <unk> against the sky-line , and their men pointed and hailed , next moment the open mouths , waving arms , and bare chests disappeared , while on another swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy theatre .
so <name> stared .
" watch out ! "
said <name> , flourishing a <unk> .
" when i tell you dip , you dip .
the <unk> 'll school any time from naow on .
where 'll we lay , <name> platt ? "
pushing , shoving , and hauling , greeting old friends here and warning old enemies there , commodore <name> platt led his little fleet well to leeward of the general crowd , and immediately three or four men began to haul on their anchors with intent to <unk> the " we 're <unk> " .
but a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with exceeding speed , its occupant pulling madly on the <unk> .
" give her slack ! "
roared twenty voices .
" let him shake it out . "
" what 's the matter ? "
said <name> , as the boat flashed away to the southward .
" he 's anchored , is n't he ? "
" anchored , sure enough , but his <unk> 's kinder shifty , " said <name> , laughing .
" whale 's fouled it .
.
.
.
dip , harve !
here they come ! "
the sea round them clouded and darkened , and then <unk> up in showers of <name> silver fish , and over a space of five or six acres the cod began to leap like trout in may ; while behind the cod three or four broad <unk> backs broke the water into boils .
then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the school , and fouled his neighbour 's line and said what was in his heart , and dipped furiously with his <unk> , and shrieked <unk> and advice to his companions , while the deep <unk> like freshly opened soda-water , and cod , men , and whales together flung in upon the luckless bait .
<name> was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of <name> 's net .
but in all the wild tumult he noticed , and never forgot , the wicked , set little eye  something like a circus elephant 's eye  of a whale that drove along almost level with the water , and , so he said , winked at him .
three boats found their <unk> fouled by these reckless <unk> hunters , and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the line free .
then the <unk> moved off and five minutes later there was no sound except the splash of the <unk> overside , the flapping of the cod , and the whack of the <unk> as the men stunned them .
it was wonderful fishing .
<name> could see the glimmering cod below , swimming slowly in droves , biting as steadily as they swam .
bank law strictly forbids more than one hook on one line when the dories are on the virgin or the eastern shoals ; but so close lay the boats that even single hooks snarled , and <name> found himself in hot argument with a gentle , hairy <unk> on one side and a howling portuguese on the other .
worse than any tangle of <unk> was the confusion of the <unk> below water .
each man had anchored where it seemed good to him , drifting and rowing round his fixed point .
as the fish struck on less quickly , each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground ; but every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or five neighbours .
to cut another 's <unk> is crime unspeakable on the banks ; yet it was done , and done without detection , three or four times that day .
<name> platt caught a maine man in the black act and knocked him over the gunwale with an oar , and <name> served a <unk> in the same way .
but <name> 's <unk> was cut , and so was penn 's , and they were turned into <unk> to <name> fish to the " we 're here " as the dories filled .
the <unk> schooled once more at twilight , when the mad clamour was repeated ; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by the light of <unk> on the edge of the pen .
it was a huge pile , and they went to sleep while they were dressing .
next day several boats fished right above the cap of the virgin ; and <name> , with them , looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock , which rises to within twenty feet of the surface .
the cod were there in legions , marching solemnly over the <unk> <unk> .
when they bit , they bit all together ; and so when they stopped .
there was a slack time at noon , and the dories began to search for amusement .
it was <name> who sighted the <name> of <unk> just coming up , and as her boats joined the company they were greeted with the question : " who 's the meanest man in the fleet ? "
three hundred voices answered cheerily : " <name> <unk> . "
it sounded an organ chant .
" who stole the <unk> ? "
that was <name> 's contribution .
" <name> <unk> , " sang the boats .
" who <unk> the salt bait fer soup ? "
this was an unknown <unk> a quarter of a mile away .
again the joyful chorus .
now , <name> was not especially mean , but he had that reputation , and the fleet made the most of it .
then they discovered a man from a truro boat who , six years before , had been convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooks  a " <unk> , " they call it  on the shoals .
naturally , he had been christened " <unk> <name> " ; and though he had hidden himself on the <unk> ever since , he found his honours waiting for him full blown .
they took it up in a sort of <unk> chorus : " <name> !
o <name> !
<name> !
o <name> !
<unk> <name> ! "
that pleased everybody .
and when a poetical <name> man  he had been making it up all day , and talked about it for weeks  sang , " the <name> pitman 's anchor does n't hold her for a cent ! "
the dories felt that they were indeed fortunate .
then they had to ask that <name> man how he was off for beans , because even poets must not have things all their own way .
every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn .
was there a careless or dirty cook anywhere ?
the dories sang about him and his food .
was a schooner badly found ?
the fleet was told at full length .
had a man hooked tobacco from a <unk> ?
he was named in meeting ; the name tossed from roller to roller .
disko 's infallible judgments , long <name> 's <unk> that he had sold years ago , <name> 's sweetheart ( oh , but <name> was an angry boy !
) , penn 's bad luck with <unk> , salters 's views on manure , <name> 's little slips from virtue ashore , and <name> 's <unk> handling of the oar  all were laid before the public ; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the sun , the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing sentence .
the dories <unk> and fished and <unk> till a swell <unk> the sea .
then they <name> more apart to save their sides , and some one called that if the swell continued the virgin would break .
a reckless galway man with his nephew denied this , hauled up anchor , and rowed over the very rock itself .
many voices called them to come away , while others dared them to hold on .
as the <unk> rollers passed to the <unk> , they hove the dory high and high into the mist , and dropped her in ugly , sucking , dimpled water , where she spun round her anchor , within a foot or two of the hidden rock .
it was playing with death for mere bravado ; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till long <name> rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their <unk> .
" ca n't ye hear ut <unk> ' ? "
he cried .
" pull for your miserable lives !
pull ! "
the men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted ; but the next swell checked a little , like a man tripping on a carpet .
there was a deep sob and a gathering roar , and the virgin flung up a couple of acres of foaming water , white , furious , and ghastly over the shoal sea .
then all the boats greatly applauded long <name> , and the galway men held their tongue .
" ai n't it elegant ? "
said <name> , bobbing like a young seal at home .
" she 'll break about once every ha'af hour now , 'less the swell piles up good .
what 's her reg'lar time when she 's at work , <name> platt ? "
" once ivry fifteen minutes , to the tick .
harve , you 've seen the greatest thing on the banks ; an ' but for long <name> you 'd seen some dead men too . "
there came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the schooners were ringing their bells .
a big bark <unk> cautiously out of the mist , and was received with shouts and cries of , " come along , darlin ' , " from the <unk> .
" another frenchman ? "
said <name> .
" <name> n't you eyes ?
she 's a baltimore boat ; goin ' in fear an ' <unk> ' , " said <name> .
" we 'll <name> the very sticks out of her .
'guess it 's the fust time her skipper ever met up with the fleet this way . "
she was a black , <unk> , <unk> craft .
her mainsail was looped up , and her <unk> flapped <unk> in what little wind was moving .
now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea , and this tall , hesitating creature , with her white and gilt <unk> , looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys .
that was very much her situation .
she knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the virgin , had caught the roar of it , and was , therefore , asking her way .
this is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories : " the virgin ?
fwhat are you talk in ' of ' ?
this is <name> have on a <name> mornin ' .
go home an ' sober up . "
" go home , ye <unk> !
go home an ' tell 'em we 're comin ' . "
half a dozen voices together , in a most <unk> chorus , as her stern went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs : " <unk>  she  strikes ! "
" hard up !
hard up fer your life !
you 're on top of her now . "
" daown !
hard daown !
let go everything ! "
" all hands to the pumps ! "
" daown jib an ' pole her ! "
here the skipper lost his temper and said things .
instantly fishing was suspended to answer him , and he heard many curious facts about his boat and her next port of call .
they asked him if he were insured ; and whence he had stolen his anchor , because , they said , it belonged to the <name> pitman ; they called his boat a <unk> , and accused him of <unk> <unk> to frighten the fish ; they offered to tow him and charge it to his wife ; and one audacious youth slipped almost under the counter , smacked it with his open palm , and yelled : " <unk> up , <name> ! "
the cook emptied a pan of ashes on him , and he replied with <unk> .
the bark 's crew fired small coal from the galley , and the dories threatened to come aboard and " <unk> " her .
they would have warned her at once had she been in real peril ; but , seeing her well clear of the virgin , they made the most of their chances .
the fun was spoilt when the rock spoke again , a half-mile to windward , and the tormented bark set everything that would draw and went her ways ; but the dories felt that the honours lay with them .
all that night the virgin roared hoarsely and next morning , over an angry , white-headed sea , <name> saw the fleet with flickering masts waiting for a lead .
not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock , when the two <unk> of the day 's eye , imagining a lull which did not exist , set the example .
in a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the <unk> swells , but troop kept the " we 're <unk> " at work <unk> .
he saw no sense in " dares " ; and as the storm grew that evening they had the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any refuge in the <name> .
the boys stood by the <unk> with lanterns , the men ready to haul , one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life .
out of the dark would come a yell of " dory , dory ! "
they would hook up and haul in a drenched man and a <unk> boat , till their decks were littered down with nests of dories and the bunks were full .
five times in their watch did <name> , with <name> , jump at the <unk> where it lay lashed on the boom , and cling with arms , legs , and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks .
one dory was smashed to pieces , and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks , cutting his forehead open ; and about <name> , when the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges , another man , blue and ghastly , crawled in with a broken hand , asking news of his brother .
seven extra mouths sat down to breakfast : a swede ; a chatham skipper ; a boy from hancock , maine ; one <unk> , and three <unk> men .
there was a general sorting out among the fleet next day ; and though no one said anything , all ate with better appetites when boat after boat reported full crews aboard .
only a couple of portuguese and an old man from gloucester were drowned , but many were cut or bruised ; and two schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward , three days ' sail .
a man died on a frenchman  it was the same bark that had traded tobacco with the " we 're <unk> " .
she slipped away quite quietly one wet , white morning , moved to a patch of deep water , her sails all hanging anyhow , and <name> saw the funeral through <unk> spy-glass .
it was only an oblong bundle slid overside .
they did not seem to have any form of service , but in the night , at anchor , <name> heard them across the <unk> black water , singing something that sounded like a hymn .
it went to a very slow tune .
la brigantine qui <unk> <unk> , roule et <unk> pour <unk> .
oh , <unk> <name> , pour <unk> <unk> dieu !
adieu , <unk> ; <unk> , adieu !
<name> platt visited her , because , he said , the dead man was his brother as a <unk> .
it came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back .
the news spread like a flash , for , contrary to general custom , the frenchman held an auction of the dead man 's <name> ,  he had no friends at st. <unk> or <unk> ,  and everything was spread out on the top of the house , from his red knitted cap to the leather belt with the <unk> at the back .
<name> and <name> were out on <unk> water in the <name> s. , and naturally rowed over to join the crowd .
it was a long pull , and they stayed some little time while <name> bought the knife , which had a curious brass handle .
when they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of rain and a <unk> of sea , it occurred to them that they might get into trouble for neglecting the lines .
" guess 'two n't hurt us any to be warmed up , " said <name> , shivering under his <unk> , and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog , which , as usual , dropped on them without warning .
" there 's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your <unk> , " he said .
" heave over the anchor , harve , and we 'll fish a piece till the thing lifts .
bend on your biggest lead .
three pound ai n't any too much in this water .
see how she 's tightened on her <unk> ' already . "
there was quite a little bubble at the bows , where some irresponsible bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope ; but they could not see a boat 's length in any direction .
<name> turned up his collar and bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator .
fog had no special terrors for him now .
they fished awhile in silence , and found the cod struck on well .
then <name> <name> the <unk> and tested the edge of it on the gunwale .
" that 's a <name> , " said <name> .
" how did you get it so cheap ? "
" on account o ' their blame <unk> superstitions , " said <name> , <unk> with the bright blade .
" they do n't fancy takin ' iron <unk> off of a dead man , so to speak .
'see them <unk> frenchmen step back when i bid ? "
" but an auction ai n't taking anything off a dead man .
it 's business . "
" we know it ai n't , but there 's no goin ' in the teeth o ' superstition .
that 's one o ' the advantages o ' livin ' in a progressive country . "
and <name> began whistling : " oh , double thatcher , how are you ?
now eastern point comes inter view .
the girls an ' boys we soon shall see , at anchor off cape <name> ! "
" why did n't that eastport man bid , then ?
he bought his boots .
ain't maine progressive ? "
" maine ?
pshaw !
they do n't know enough , or they <name> n't got money enough , to paint their <unk> in maine .
i 've seen 'em .
the eastport man he told me that the knife had been used  so the french captain told him  used up on the french coast last year . "
" cut a man ?
heave 's the <unk> . "
<name> hauled in his fish , <unk> , and threw over .
" killed him !
'course , when i heard that i was keener 'n ever to get it . "
" christmas !
i did n't know it , " said <name> , turning round .
" i 'll give you a dollar for it when i  get my wages .
say , i 'll give you two dollars . "
" honest ?
d'you like it as much as all that ? "
said <name> , flushing .
" well , to tell the truth , i kinder got it for you  to give ; but i did n't let on till i saw how you 'd take it .
it 's yours and welcome , harve , because we 're <unk> , and so on and so forth , an ' so <unk> ' .
catch <unk> ! "
he held it out , belt and all .
" but look at here .
<name> , i do n't see  " " take it .
'tai n't no use to me .
i wish you to hev it . "
the temptation was irresistible .
" <name> , you 're a white man , " said <name> .
" i 'll keep it as long as i live . "
" that 's good <unk> ' , " said <name> , with a pleasant laugh ; and then , anxious to change the subject : " look 's if your line was fast to somethin ' . "
" fouled , i guess , " said harve , tugging .
before he pulled up he fastened the belt round him , and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath click on the thwart .
" concern the thing ! "
he cried .
" she acts as though she were on <unk> .
it 's all sand here , ai n't it ' ? "
<name> reached over and gave a <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> 'll act that way <unk> he 's sulky .
thet 's no <unk> .
yank her once or twice .
she gives , sure .
'guess we 'd better haul up an ' make certain . "
they pulled together , making fast at each turn on the <unk> , and the hidden weight rose <unk> .
" prize , oh !
haul ! "
shouted <name> , but the shout ended in a shrill , double shriek of horror , for out of the sea came  the body of the dead frenchman buried two days before !
the hook had caught him under the right armpit , and he swayed , erect and horrible , head and shoulders above water .
his arms were tied to his side , and  he had no face .
the boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory , and there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside , held on the shortened line .
" the tide  the tide brought him ! "
said <name> , with quivering lips , as he fumbled at the clasp of the belt .
" oh , lord !
oh , harve ! "
groaned <name> , " be quick .
he 's come for it .
let him have it .
take it off . "
" i do n't want it !
i do n't want it ! "
cried <name> .
" i ca n't find the <unk> . "
" quick , harve !
he 's on your line ! "
<name> sat up to <unk> the belt , facing the head that had no face under its streaming hair .
" he 's fast still , " he whispered to <name> , who slipped out his knife and cut the line , as <name> flung the belt far overside .
the body shot down with a <unk> , and <name> cautiously rose to his knees , whiter than the fog .
" he come for it .
he come for it .
i 've seen a stale one hauled up on a trawl and i did n't much care , but he come to us special . "
" i wish  i wish i had n't taken the knife .
then he 'd have come on your line . "
" dunno as thet would <name> ' made any differ .
we 're both scared out o ' ten years ' growth .
oh , harve , did ye see his head ? "
" did i ' ?
i 'll never forget it .
but look at here , <name> ; it could n't have been meant .
it was only the tide . "
" tide !
he come for it , harve .
why , they sunk him six mile to <unk> o ' the fleet , an ' we 're two miles from where she 's lyin ' now .
they told me he was weighted with a fathom an ' a half o ' <unk> . "
" wonder what he did with the knife  up on the french coast ? "
" something bad .
'guess he 's bound to take it with him to the judgment , an ' so  what are you doin ' with the fish ? "
" heaving 'em overboard , " said <name> .
" what for ?
we sha'n't eat 'em . "
" i do n't care .
i had to look at his face while i was takin ' the belt off .
you can keep your catch if you like .
i 've no use for mine . "
<name> said nothing , but threw his fish over again .
" 'guess it 's best to be on the safe side , " he murmured at last .
" i'd give a month 's pay if this fog <unk> 'd lift .
things go abaout in a fog that ye do n't see in clear weather  <unk> an ' <unk> and such like .
i 'm <unk> relieved he come the way he did instid o ' walkin ' .
he might <name> ' walked . "
" <unk> n't , <name> !
we 're right on top of him now .
'wish i was safe aboard , bein ' pounded by uncle salters . "
" they 'll be lookin ' fer us in a little .
gim me the <unk> . "
<name> took the tin <unk> , but paused before he blew .
" go on , " said <name> .
" i do n't want to stay here all night . "
" question is , haow he 'd take it .
there was a man <unk> down the coast told me once he was in a schooner where they <unk> n't ever blow a horn to the dories , <unk> the skipper  not the man he was with , but a captain that had run her five years before  he 'd drownded a boy alongside in a drunk fit ; an ' ever after , that boy he 'd row alongside too and shout , <unk> !
dory ! '
with the rest . "
" dory !
dory ! "
a muffled voice cried through the fog .
they cowered again , and the horn dropped from <name> 's hand .
" hold on ! "
cried <name> ; " it 's the cook . "
" dunno what made me think o ' thet fool tale , either , " said <name> .
" it's the doctor , sure enough . "
" <name> !
<name> !
<unk> , <name> !
harve !
<name> !
<unk> , <unk> ! "
" we 're here , " <name> both boys together .
they heard oars , but could see nothing till the cook , shining and dripping , rowed into them .
" what <unk> happened ? "
said he .
" you <name> be beaten at home . "
" thet 's what we want .
thet 's what we 're <unk> ' for , " said <name> .
" anything <unk> 's good enough fer us .
we 've had kinder <unk> company . "
as the cook passed them a line , <name> told him the tale .
" yess !
he come for hiss knife , " was all he said at the end .
never had the little rocking " we 're here " looked so deliciously home  like as when the cook , born and bred in fogs , rowed them back to her .
there was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying smell of food forward , and it was heavenly to hear disko and the others , all quite alive and solid , leaning over the rail and promising them a first-class pounding .
but the cook was a black master of strategy .
he did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more striking points of the tale , explaining as he backed and bumped round the counter how <name> was the <unk> to destroy any possible bad luck .
so the boys came overside as rather uncanny heroes , and every one asked them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble .
little penn delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions ; but public opinion was against him and in favour of long <name> , who told the most excruciating <unk> to nearly midnight .
under that influence no one except salters and penn said anything about " idolatry " when the cook put a lighted candle , a cake of flour and water , and a pinch of salt on a shingle , and floated them out astern to keep the frenchman quiet in case he was still restless .
<name> lit the candle because he had bought the belt , and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he could see the ducking point of flame .
said <name> to <name> , as they turned in after watch : " how about progress and catholic superstitions ? "
" huh !
i guess i 'm as enlightened and progressive as the next man , but when it comes to a dead st. <unk> <unk> <unk> ' a couple o ' pore boys stiff fer the sake of a <unk> knife , why , then , the cook can take hold fer all o ' me .
i mistrust <unk> , livin ' or dead . "
next morning all , except the cook , were rather ashamed of the ceremonies , and went to work double tides , speaking gruffly to one another .
the " we 're here " was racing neck and neck for her last few loads against the " parry <name> " ; and so close was the struggle that the fleet took sides and <unk> tobacco .
all hands worked at the lines or <unk> till they fell asleep where they stood  beginning before <name> and ending when it was too dark to see .
they even used the cook as pitcher , and turned <name> into the hold to pass salt , while <name> helped to dress down .
luckily a " parry <name> " man sprained his ankle falling down the fo'c'sle , and the " we 're <unk> " gained .
<name> could not see how one more fish could be crammed into her , but disko and <name> platt stowed and stowed , and <unk> the mass down with big stones from the ballast , and there was always " jest another day 's work . "
disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted .
he rolled to the <unk> aft the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail .
this was at ten in the morning .
the <unk> was down and the main and <unk> were up by noon , and dories came alongside with letters for home , <unk> their good fortune .
at last she cleared decks , hoisted her flag ,  as is the right of the first boat off the banks ,  <unk> , and began to move .
disko pretended that he wished to accommodate folk who had not sent in their mail , and so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners .
in reality , that was his little triumphant procession , and for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was .
<unk> accordion and <name> platt 's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse you must not sing till all the salt is wet : " <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
send your letters <unk> !
all our salt is wetted , an ' the anchor 's off the <unk> !
bend , oh , bend your <unk> ! , we 're back to <unk>  with fifteen hunder ' <unk> , an ' fifteen hunder ' <unk> , <unk> hunder ' <unk> ' <unk> , <unk> ' old <unk> an ' grand . "
the last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal , and the gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and owners , while the " we 're here " finished the musical ride through the fleet , her <unk> quivering like a man 's hand when he raises it to say good-bye .
<name> very soon discovered that the " we 're here " , with her <unk> , strolling from berth to berth , and the " we 're here " headed west by south under home canvas , were two very different boats .
there was a bite and kick to the wheel even in " boy 's " weather ; he could feel the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges , and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy .
disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails ; and when those were flattened like a racing yacht 's , <name> had to wait on the big <unk> , which was put over by hand every time she went about .
in spare moments they pumped , for the packed fish dripped brine , which does not improve a cargo .
but since there was no fishing , <name> had time to look at the sea from another point of view .
the <unk> schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings .
they saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell ; and usually she was <unk> , <unk> , and coaxing her steadfast way through grey , <unk> , or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam ; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger <unk> .
it was as if she said : " you would n't hurt me , surely ?
i'm only the little 'we 're here ' . "
then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle .
the dullest of folk can not see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it ; and <name> , being anything but dull , began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of <unk> turning over with a sound of incessant tearing ; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the <unk> <unk> ; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise ; the folding and packing away of the morning mists , wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors ; the <unk> glare and blaze of noon ; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead , flat square miles ; the chilly <unk> of everything at the day 's end ; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight , when the <unk> solemnly poked at the low stars , and <name> went down to get a doughnut from the cook .
but the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together , <name> platt within hail , and she <unk> her <unk> down to the crashing blue , and kept a little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her windlass .
then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts , and the sheets creaked , and the sails filled with roaring ; and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress , and came out , her jib wet half-way up , yearning and peering for the tall <unk> of thatcher 's island .
they left the cold grey of the bank sea , saw the <unk> making for quebec by the straits of st. <name> , with the jersey <unk> from spain and sicily ; found a friendly <unk> off <unk> bank that drove them within view of the east light of sable island ,  a sight disko did not linger over ,  and stayed with them past western and <name> have , to the northern fringe of <name> 's .
from there they picked up the deeper water , and let her go merrily .
" <name> 's pulling on the string , " <name> confided to <name> .
" <name> an' <name> .
next <name> you 'll be <unk> ' a boy to throw water on the windows to make ye go to sleep .
'guess you 'll keep with us till your folks come .
do you know the best of gettin ' ashore again ? "
" hot bath ' ? "
said <name> .
his eyebrows were all white with dried spray .
" that 's good , but a <unk> 's better .
i 've been <unk> ' o' <unk> ever since we bent our mainsail .
ye can <unk> your toes then .
<name> 'll hev a new one fer me , all washed soft .
it 's home , harve .
it 's home !
ye can sense it in the air .
we 're runnin ' into the <unk> of a hot wave naow , an ' i can smell the <unk> .
wonder if we 'll get in fer supper .
port a trifle . "
the hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep smoothed out , blue and oily , round them .
when they whistled for a wind only the rain came in <unk> rods , bubbling and drumming , and behind the rain the thunder and the lightning of <unk> .
they lay on the deck with bare feet and arms , telling one another what they would order at their first meal ashore ; for now the land was in plain sight .
a gloucester <unk> drifted alongside , a man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourishing his harpoon , his bare head plastered down with the wet .
" and all 's well ! "
he sang cheerily , as though he were watch on a big liner .
" <unk> 's waiting fer you , disko .
what 's the news o ' the fleet ? "
disko shouted it and passed on , while the wild summer storm pounded overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at once .
it gave the low circle of hills round gloucester harbour , ten pound island , the <unk> , with the broken line of <unk> , and each spar and buoy on the water , in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the " we 're here " crawled in on <unk> , and the <unk> moaned and mourned behind her .
then the storm died out in long , separated , vicious <unk> of blue-white flame , followed by a single roar like the roar of a <unk> , and the shaken air tingled under the stars as it got back to silence .
" the flag , the flag ! "
said disko , suddenly , pointing upward .
" what is ut ? "
said long <name> .
" <name> !
ha'af mast .
they can see us <unk> shore now . "
" i 'd clean forgot .
he 's no folk to gloucester , has he ? "
" girl he was goin ' to be married to this fall . "
" <name> pity her ! "
said long <name> , and lowered the little flag <unk> for the sake of <name> , swept overboard in a <name> off <name> have three months before .
disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the " we 're here " to <unk> 's wharf , giving his orders in whispers , while she swung round moored tugs and <unk> hailed her from the ends of <unk> piers .
over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession , <name> could feel the land close round him once more , with all its thousands of people asleep , and the smell of earth after rain , and the familiar noise of a <unk> coughing to herself in a <unk> ; and all those things made his heart beat and his throat dry up as he stood by the <unk> .
they heard the <unk> snoring on a <unk> , <unk> into a pocket of darkness where a lantern glimmered on either side ; somebody waked with a grunt , threw them a rope , and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great <unk> sheds full of warm emptiness , and lay there without a sound .
then <name> sat down by the wheel , and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart would break , and a tall woman who had been sitting on a <unk> dropped down into the schooner and kissed <name> once on the cheek ; for she was his mother , and she had seen the " we 're here " by the <unk> .
she took no notice of <name> till he had recovered himself a little and disko had told her his story .
then they went to disko 's house together as the <name> was breaking ; and until the telegraph office was open and he could wire to his folk , <name> cheyne was perhaps the <unk> boy in all <name> .
but the curious thing was that disko and <name> seemed to think none the worse of him for crying .
<unk> was not ready for disko 's prices till disko , sure that the " we 're here " was at least a week ahead of any other gloucester boat , had given him a few days to swallow them ; so all hands played about the streets , and long <name> stopped the <name> neck trolley , on principle , as he said , till the conductor let him ride free .
but <name> went about with his freckled nose in the air , <unk> of mystery and most haughty to his family .
" <name> , i 'll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way , " said troop , pensively .
" sence we 've come ashore this time you 've bin a heap too fresh . "
" i 'd lay into him naow ef he was mine , " said uncle salters , sourly .
he and penn boarded with the troops .
" oho ! "
said <name> , shuffling with the accordion round the <unk> , ready to leap the fence if the enemy advanced .
" dad , you 're welcome to your own <unk> , but remember i 've warned ye .
your own flesh an' blood <name> ' warned ye !
'tai n't any o ' my fault ef you 're mistook , but i 'll be on deck to watch ye .
an ' ez fer yeou , uncle salters , <unk> chief butler ai n't in it <unk> o ' you !
you watch aout an ' wait .
you 'll be ploughed under like your own blamed clover ; but me  <name> troop  i 'll flourish like a green <unk> because i war n't stuck on my own opinion . "
disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful <unk> .
" you 're gettin ' ez crazy as poor harve .
you two go araound <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' an ' <unk> ' each other under the table till there 's no peace in the <unk> , " said he .
" there 's goin ' to be a heap less  fer some folks , " <name> replied .
" you wait an ' see . "
he and <name> went out on the trolley to east gloucester , where they tramped through the <unk> to the lighthouse , and lay down on the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry .
<name> had shown <name> a telegram , and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst .
" harve 's folk ? "
said <name> , with an unruffled face after supper .
" well , i guess they do n't amount to much of anything , or we 'd <name> ' heard <unk> 'em by naow .
his pop keeps a kind o ' store out west .
maybe he 'll give <unk> much as five dollars , dad . "
" what did i tell ye ? "
said salters .
" do n't <unk> over your vittles , <name> . "
chapter ix whatever his private sorrows may be , a <unk> , like any other <unk> , should keep abreast of his business .
<name> cheyne , senior , had gone east late in <name> to meet a woman broken down , half mad , who dreamed day and night of her son drowning in the grey seas .
he had surrounded her with doctors , trained nurses , <unk> , and even <unk> companions , but they were useless .
mrs. cheyne lay still and moaned , or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would listen .
<name> she had none , and who could offer it ?
all she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt ; and her husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment .
of his own sorrow he spoke little  hardly realised the depth of it till he caught himself asking the calendar on his <unk> , " what 's the use of going on ? "
there had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that , some day , when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left college , he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his possessions .
then that boy , he argued , as busy fathers do , would instantly become his companion , partner , and ally , and there would follow splendid years of great works carried out together  the old head backing the young fire .
now his boy was dead  lost at sea , as it might have been a swede sailor from one of cheyne 's big <unk> ; the wife was dying , or worse ; he himself was trodden down by <unk> of women and doctors and maids and attendants ; worried almost beyond endurance by the shift and change of her poor restless whims ; hopeless , with no heart to meet his many enemies .
he had taken the wife to his raw new palace in san <name> , where she and her people occupied a wing of great price , and cheyne , in a <unk> , between a secretary and a typewriter , who was also a <unk> , toiled along wearily from day to day .
there was a war of rates among four western railroads in which he was supposed to be interested ; a devastating strike had developed in his <unk> in oregon , and the legislature of the state of california , which has no love for its makers , was preparing open war against him .
ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered , and have waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign .
but now he sat limply , his soft black hat pushed forward on to his nose , his big body shrunk inside his loose clothes , staring at his boots or the chinese junks in the bay , and <unk> absently to the secretary 's questions as he opened the saturday mail .
cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull out .
he carried huge <unk> , could buy himself <name> <unk> , and between one of his places in colorado and a little society ( that would do the wife good ) , say in washington and the south <name> islands , a man might forget plans that had come to nothing .
on the other hand ...
the click of the typewriter stopped ; the girl was looking at the secretary , who had turned white .
he passed cheyne a telegram repeated from san <name> : picked up by fishing schooner " we 're here " having fallen off boat great times on banks fishing all well waiting gloucester mass care disko troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is mama <name> n. cheyne .
the father let it fall , laid his head down on the <unk> of the shut desk , and breathed heavily .
the secretary ran for mrs. <unk> doctor , who found cheyne pacing to and fro .
" <unk> d'you think of it ?
is it possible ?
is there any meaning to it ?
i ca n't quite make it out , " he cried .
" i can , " said the doctor .
" i lose seven thousand a year  that 's all . "
he thought of the struggling new york practice he had dropped at cheyne 's imperious bidding , and returned the telegram with a sigh .
" you mean you 'd tell her ?
'maybe a fraud ? "
" what 's the motive ? "
said the doctor , coolly .
" detection 's too certain .
it 's the boy sure enough . "
enter a french maid , <unk> , as an indispensable one who is kept on only by large wages .
" mrs. cheyne she say you must come at once .
she think you are seek . "
the master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed <name> ; and a thin , high voice on the upper landing of the great <unk> square staircase cried : " what is it ?
what has happened ? "
no doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house a moment later , when her husband blurted out the news .
" and that 's all right , " said the doctor , serenely , to the typewriter .
" about the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is that <name> do n't kill , miss <unk> . "
" i know it ; but we 've a heap to do first . "
miss <unk> was from <unk> , somewhat direct of speech ; and as her fancy leaned towards the secretary , she divined there was work in hand .
he was looking earnestly at the vast <unk> of <name> on the wall .
" <unk> , we 're going right across .
private car straight through  boston .
fix the connections , " shouted cheyne down the staircase .
" i thought so . "
the secretary turned to the typewriter , and their eyes met ( out of that was born a story  nothing to do with this story ) .
she looked inquiringly , doubtful of his resources .
he signed to her to move to the morse as a general brings brigades into action .
then he swept his hand .
<unk> through his hair , regarded the ceiling , and set to work , while miss <unk> 's white fingers called up the continent of <name> .
" k. h. <name> , los <name>  the <unk> ' is at los <name> , is n't she , miss <unk> ? "
" <unk> . "
miss <unk> nodded between <unk> as the secretary looked at his watch .
" ready ?
send <unk> , ' private car , here , and arrange for special to leave here <name> in time to connect with new york limited at sixteenth street , chicago , tuesday next . "
click  click  click !
" could n't you better that ' ? "
" not on those grades .
that gives 'em sixty hours from here to chicago .
they wo n't gain anything by taking a special east of that .
ready ?
also arrange with lake shore and michigan southern to take <unk> ' on new york central and hudson river buffalo to albany , and b. and a. the same albany to boston .
indispensable i should reach boston wednesday evening .
be sure nothing prevents .
have also wired <unk> , <unk> , and <unk>  sign , cheyne . "
miss <unk> nodded , and the secretary went on .
" now then .
<unk> , <unk> , and barnes , of course .
ready ?
<unk> chicago .
please take my private car <unk> 'from <name> <name> at sixteenth street next tuesday p. m. on n. y .
limited through to buffalo and deliver n. y. c. for <unk>  ever bin to n ' york , miss <unk> ?
we 'll go some day .
ready ?
take car buffalo to albany on limited tuesday p. m. that 's for <unk> . "
" have n't bin to noo york , but i know that ! "
with a toss of the head .
" beg pardon .
now , boston and albany , barnes , same instructions from albany through to boston .
leave <unk> p. m. ( you need n't wire that ) ; arrive <unk> p. m. wednesday .
that covers everything <name> <name> do , but it pays to shake up the managers . "
" it 's great , " said miss <unk> , with a look of admiration .
this was the kind of man she understood and appreciated .
" 't is n't bad , " said <unk> , modestly .
" now , any one but me would have lost thirty hours and spent a week working out the run , instead of handing him over to the <name> <name> straight through to chicago . "
" but see here , about that noo york limited .
<name> <unk> himself could n't hitch his car to her , " miss <unk> suggested , recovering herself .
" yes , but this is n't <name> .
it 's cheyne  lightning .
it goes . "
" even so .
guess we 'd better wire the boy .
you 've forgotten that , anyhow . "
" i 'll ask . "
when he returned with the father 's message bidding <name> meet them in boston at an appointed hour , he found miss <unk> laughing over the keys .
then <unk> laughed too , for the frantic <unk> from los <name> ran : " we want to know why  why  why ?
general uneasiness developed and spreading . "
ten minutes later chicago appealed to miss <unk> in these words : " if crime of century is maturing please warn friends in time .
we are all getting to cover here . "
this was capped by a message from <unk> ( and wherein <unk> was concerned even <unk> could not guess ) : " do n't shoot , colonel .
we'll come down . "
cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the telegrams were laid before him .
" they think we 're on the war-path .
tell 'em we do n't feel like fighting just now , <unk> .
tell 'em what we're going for .
i guess you and miss <unk> had better come along , though it is n't likely i shall do any business on the road .
tell 'em the truth  for once . "
so the truth was told .
miss <unk> clicked in the sentiment while the secretary added the memorable quotation , " let us have peace , " and in <unk> two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three million dollars ' worth of variously <unk> railroad interests breathed more freely .
cheyne was flying to meet the only son , so miraculously restored to him .
the bear was seeking his cub , not the bulls .
hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the weapons and wished him <unk> , while half a dozen <unk> <unk> roads <unk> up their heads and spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not cheyne buried the hatchet .
it was a busy week-end among the wires ; for , now that their anxiety was removed , men and cities hastened to accommodate .
los <name> called to san <name> and <unk> that the southern california engineers might know and be ready in their lonely <unk> ; <unk> passed the word to the atlantic and pacific ; the <unk> flung it the whole length of the <unk> , <unk> , and <name> <name> management , even into chicago .
an engine , <unk> with crew , and the great and gilded " <name> " private car were to be " <unk> " over those two thousand three hundred and fifty miles .
the train would take precedence of one hundred and <unk> others meeting and passing ; despatches and crews of every one of those said trains must be notified .
sixteen locomotives , sixteen engineers , and sixteen firemen would be needed  each and every one the best available .
two and one half minutes would be allowed for changing engines , three for watering , and two for <unk> .
" warn the men , and arrange tanks and <unk> accordingly ; for <name> cheyne is in a hurry , a <unk> hurry , " sang the wires .
" forty miles an hour <name> be expected , and division superintendents <name> accompany this special over their respective divisions .
from san <name> to sixteenth street , chicago , let the magic carpet be laid down .
hurry !
oh , hurry ! "
" it <name> be hot , " said cheyne , as they rolled out of san <name> in the <name> of <name> .
" we 're going to hurry , mama , just as fast as ever we can ; but i really do n't think there 's any good of your putting on your bonnet and gloves yet .
you 'd much better lie down and take your medicine .
i 'd play you a game o ' dominoes , but it 's <name> . "
" i 'll be good .
oh , i <name> be good .
only  taking off my bonnet makes me feel as if we 'd never get there . "
" try to sleep a little , mama , and we 'll be in chicago before you know . "
" but it 's boston , father .
tell them to hurry . "
the six-foot drivers were hammering their way to san <unk> and the <unk> wastes , but this was no grade for speed .
that would come later .
the heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the needles and the colorado river .
the car cracked in the utter drought and glare , and they put crushed ice to mrs. <unk> neck , and toiled up the long , long grades , past ash fork , towards flagstaff , where the forests and <unk> are , under the dry , remote skies .
the needle of the <unk> flicked and wagged to and fro ; the cinders rattled on the roof , and a whirl of dust sucked after the whirling wheels , the crew of the combination sat on their bunks , panting in their shirt-sleeves , and cheyne found himself among them shouting old , old stories of the railroad that every <unk> knows , above the roar of the car .
he told them about his son , and how the sea had given up its dead , and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him ; asked after " her , back there , " and whether she could stand it if the engineer " let her out a piece , " and cheyne thought she could .
accordingly , the great <unk> was " let out " from flagstaff to <unk> , till a division superintendent protested .
but mrs. cheyne , in the boudoir state-room , where the french maid , <unk> with fear , clung to the silver <unk> , only moaned a little and begged her husband to bid them " hurry . "
and so they dropped the dry sands and <unk> rocks of arizona behind them , and <unk> on till the crash of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> told them they were at <unk> by the continental divide .
three bold and experienced men  cool , confident , and dry when they began ; white , quivering , and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible wheels  swung her over the great lift from <unk> to <unk> and beyond <unk> , up and up to the <unk> tunnel on the state line , whence they dropped rocking into la <unk> , had sight of the arkansaw , and tore down the long slope to dodge city , where cheyne took comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead .
there was very little talk in the car .
the secretary and typewriter sat together on the stamped <unk> cushions by the plate-glass <unk> at the rear end , watching the surge and ripple of the ties crowded back behind them , and , it is believed , making notes of the scenery .
cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant <unk> and the naked necessity of the combination , an <unk> cigar in his teeth , till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy , and did their best to entertain him .
at night the bunched electrics lit up that <unk> palace of all the luxuries , and they fared sumptuously , swinging on through the emptiness of abject desolation .
now they heard the swish of a <unk> , and the guttural voice of a <unk> , the <unk> of hammers that tested the <unk> steel wheels , and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear platform ; now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender ; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting train .
now they looked out into great abysses , a trestle purring beneath their tread , or up to rocks that barred out half the stars .
now <unk> and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizon 's edge , and now broke into hills lower and lower , till at last came the true plains .
at dodge city an unknown hand threw in a copy of a kansas paper containing some sort of an interview with <name> , who had evidently fallen in with an enterprising reporter , telegraphed on from boston .
the joyful <unk> revealed that it was beyond question their boy , and it soothed mrs. cheyne for a while .
her one word " hurry " was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at <unk> , <unk> , and <name> , where the grades are easy , and they brushed the continent behind them .
towns and villages were close together now , and a man could feel here that he moved among people .
" i ca n't see the dial , and my eyes ache so .
what are we doing ? "
" the very best we can , mama .
there 's no sense in getting in before the limited .
we 'd only have to wait . "
" i do n't care .
i want to feel we 're moving .
sit down and tell me the miles . "
cheyne sat down and read the dial for her ( there were some miles which stand for records to this day ) , but the <unk> car never changed its long , <unk> roll , moving through the heat with the hum of a giant <name> .
yet the speed was not enough for mrs. cheyne ; and the heat , the remorseless <name> heat , was making her giddy ; the <unk> would not move , and when , oh , when would they be in chicago ?
it is not true that , as they changed engines at fort <name> , cheyne passed over to the amalgamated brotherhood of locomotive engineers an endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for evermore .
he paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed they deserved , and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had <unk> with him .
it is on record that the last crew took entire charge of switching operations at sixteenth street , because " she " was in a doze at last , and heaven was to help any one who bumped her .
now the highly paid specialist who conveys the lake shore and michigan southern limited from chicago to <unk> is something of an autocrat , and he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car .
none the less he handled the " <name> " as if she might have been a load of dynamite , and when the crew rebuked him , they did it in whispers and dumb show .
" pshaw ! "
said the <unk> , <unk> , and <name> <name> men , discussing life later , " we were n't runnin ' for a record .
<name> cheyne 's wife , she were sick back , an ' we did n't want to <unk> her .
'come to think of it , our runnin ' time from san <name> to chicago was <unk> .
you can tell that to them eastern <unk> .
when we 're tryin ' for a record , we 'll let you know . "
to the western man ( though this would not please either city ) chicago and boston are cheek by jowl , and some railroads encourage the delusion .
the limited whirled the " <name> " into buffalo and the arms of the new york central and hudson river ( illustrious <unk> with white whiskers and gold charms on their <unk> boarded her here to talk a little business to cheyne ) , who slid her gracefully into albany , where the boston and albany completed the run from <unk> to <unk>  total time , <unk> hours and thirty-five minutes , or three days , fifteen hours and one half .
<name> was waiting for them .
after violent emotion most people and all boys demand food .
they feasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains , cut off in their great happiness , while the trains roared in and out around them .
<name> ate , drank , and enlarged on his adventures all in one breath , and when he had a hand free his mother fondled it .
his voice was thickened with living in the open , salt air ; his palms were rough and hard , his wrists dotted with the marks of <unk> ; and a fine full flavour of <unk> <name> round rubber boots and blue jersey .
the father , well used to judging men , looked at him keenly .
he did not know what enduring harm the boy might have taken .
indeed , he caught himself thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son ; but he distinctly remembered an unsatisfied , <unk> youth who took delight in " calling down the old man " and reducing his mother to tears  such a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel <unk> , where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or <unk> the <unk> .
but this well <unk> <unk> did not wriggle , looked at him with eyes steady , clear , and unflinching , and spoke in a tone distinctly , even startlingly , respectful .
there was that in his voice , too , which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent , and that the new <name> had come to stay .
" some one 's been <unk> him , " thought cheyne .
" now <name> would never have allowed that .
do n't see as europe could have done it any better . "
" but why did n't you tell this man , troop , who you were ? "
the mother repeated , when <name> had expanded his story at least twice .
" disko troop , dear .
the best man that ever walked a deck .
i do n't care who the next is . "
" why did n't you tell him to put you ashore ?
you know papa would have made it up to him ten times over . "
" i know it ; but he thought i was crazy .
i 'm afraid i called him a thief because i could n't find the bills in my pocket . "
" a sailor found them by the flagstaff that  that night , " sobbed mrs. cheyne .
" that explains it , then .
i do n't blame troop any .
i just said i would n't work  on a banker , too  and of course he hit me on the nose , and oh !
i bled like a stuck hog . "
" my poor darling !
they must have abused you horribly . "
" dunno quite .
well , after that , i saw a light . "
cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled .
this was going to be a boy after his own hungry heart .
he had never seen precisely that twinkle in <name> 's eye before .
" and the old man gave me ten and a half a month ; he 's paid me half now ; and i took hold with <name> and pitched right in .
i ca n't do a man 's work yet .
but i can handle a dory 'most as well as <name> , and i do n't get rattled in a fog  much ; and i can take my trick in light winds  that's steering , dear  and i can 'most bait up a trawl , and i know my ropes , of course ; and i can pitch fish till the cows come home , and i 'm great on old josephus , and i 'll show you how i can clear coffee with a piece of <unk> , and  i think i 'll have another cup , please .
say , you've no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month ! "
" i began with eight and a half , my son , " said cheyne .
" 'that so ?
you never told me , sir . "
" you never asked , harve .
i 'll tell you about it some day , if you care to listen .
try a stuffed <name> . "
" troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how the next man gets his vittles .
it 's great to have a <unk> meal again .
we were well fed , though .
best mug on the banks .
disko fed us first-class .
he 's a great man .
and <name>  that 's his son  <name> 's my partner .
and there 's uncle salters and his <unk> , an ' he reads josephus .
he 's sure i 'm crazy yet .
and there 's poor little penn , and he is crazy .
you must n't talk to him about <unk> , because  and , oh , you must know <name> platt and long <name> and <name> .
<name> saved my life .
i 'm sorry he 's a <unk> .
he ca n't talk much , but he 's an everlasting musician .
he found me struck adrift and drifting , and hauled me in . "
" i wonder your nervous system is n't completely wrecked , " said mrs. cheyne .
" what for , mama ?
i worked like a horse and i ate like a hog and i slept like a dead man . "
that was too much for mrs. cheyne , who began to think of her visions of a corpse rocking on the <unk> seas .
she went to her state-room , and <name> curled up beside his father , explaining his indebtedness .
" you can depend upon me to do everything i can for the crowd , harve .
they seem to be good men on your showing . "
" best in the fleet , sir .
ask at gloucester , " said <name> .
" but disko believes still he 's cured me of being crazy .
<name> 's the only one i've let on to about you , and our private cars and all the rest of it , and i 'm not quite sure <name> believes .
i want to <unk> 'em to-morrow .
say , ca n't they run the <unk> ' over to gloucester ?
mama do n't look fit to be moved , anyway , and we 're bound to finish cleaning out by to-morrow .
<unk> takes our fish .
you see , we 're first off the banks this season , and it 's four twenty-five a <unk> .
we held out till he paid it .
they want it quick . "
" you mean you 'll have to work to-morrow , then ? "
" i told troop i would .
i 'm on the scales .
i 've brought the <unk> with me . "
he looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his father choke .
" there is n't but three  no  two ninety-four or five <unk> more by my reckoning . "
" hire a substitute , " suggested cheyne , to see what <name> would say .
" ca n't , sir .
i 'm <unk> for the schooner .
troop says i 've a better head for figures than <name> .
troop 's a mighty just man . "
" well , suppose i do n't move the <unk> ' to-night , how 'll you fix it ? "
<name> looked at the clock , which marked twenty past eleven .
" then i 'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight .
they let us men from the fleet ride free , as a rule . "
" that 's a notion .
but i think we can get the <unk> ' around about as soon as your men 's freight .
better go to bed now . "
<name> spread himself on the sofa , kicked off his boots , and was asleep before his father could shade the electrics .
cheyne sat watching the young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead , and among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been <unk> as a father .
" one never knows when one 's taking one 's biggest risks , " he said .
" it might have been worse than drowning ; but i do n't think it has  i don't think it has .
if it has n't , i have n't enough to pay troop , that 's all ; and i do n't think it has . "
morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows , the " <name> " was <unk> among <unk> at gloucester , and <name> had gone to his business .
" then he 'll fall overboard again and be drowned , " the mother said bitterly .
" we 'll go and look , ready to throw him a rope in case .
you 've never seen him working for his bread , " said the father .
" what nonsense !
as if any one expected  " " well , the man that hired him did .
he 's about right , too . "
they went down between the stores full of fishermen 's <unk> to <unk> 's wharf , where the " we 're here " rode high , her bank flag still flying , all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light .
disko stood by the main hatch superintending <name> , penn , and uncle salters at the tackle .
<name> was swinging the loaded baskets <unk> as long <name> and <name> platt filled them , and <name> , with a notebook , represented the skipper 's interests before the clerk of the scales on the <unk> <unk> .
" ready ! "
cried the voices below .
" haul ! "
cried disko .
" hi ! "
said <name> .
" here ! "
said <name> , swinging the basket .
then they heard <unk> voice , clear and fresh , checking the weights .
the last of the fish had been whipped out , and <name> leaped from the <unk> six feet to a <unk> , as the shortest way to hand disko the tally , shouting , " two <unk> , and an empty hold ! "
" what 's total , harve ? "
said disko .
" eight sixty-five .
three thousand six hundred and <unk> dollars and a quarter .
'wish i 'd share as well as wage . "
" well , i wo n't go so far as to say you hev n't deserved it , harve .
don't you want to slip up to <unk> 's office and take him our <unk> ? "
" who 's that boy ? "
said cheyne to <name> , well used to all manner of questions from those idle <unk> called summer boarders .
" well , he 's a kind o ' supercargo , " was the answer .
" we picked him up struck adrift on the banks .
fell overboard from a liner , he sez .
he was a passenger .
he 's by way o ' bein ' a fisherman now . "
" is he worth his keep ? "
" <unk> .
dad , this man wants to know ef harve 's worth his keep .
say , would you like to go aboard ?
we 'll fix a ladder for her . "
" i should very much , indeed .
'two n't hurt you , mama , and you 'll be able to see for yourself . "
the woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the ladder , and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft .
" be you anyways interested in harve ? "
said disko .
" well , ye-es . "
" he 's a good boy , an ' <unk> right hold jest as he 's bid .
you 've heard haow we found him ?
he was <unk> ' from nervous prostration , i guess , <unk> else his head had hit somethin ' , when we hauled him aboard .
he 's all over that naow .
yes , this is the cabin .
'tai n't anyways in order , but you 're quite welcome to look around .
those are his figures on the stove-pipe , where we keep the <unk> ' mostly . "
" did he sleep here ? "
said mrs. cheyne , sitting on a yellow locker and surveying the disorderly bunks .
" no .
he <unk> forward , madam , an ' only fer him an ' my boy <unk> fried pies an ' <unk> ' up when they ought to <name> ' been asleep , i dunno as i 've any special fault to find with him . "
" there were n't nothin ' wrong with harve , " said uncle salters , descending the steps .
" he <name> my boots on the <unk> , and he ain't over an ' above respectful to such as knows more'n he do , especially about <unk> ' ; but he were mostly misled by <name> . "
<name> , in the meantime , <unk> by dark hints from <name> early that morning , was executing a <unk> on deck .
" <name> , <name> ! "
he whispered down the hatch .
" his folks has come , an ' dad <name> n't caught on yet , an' they 're <unk> ' in the cabin .
she 's a <name> , an ' he 's all harve claimed he was , by the looks of him . "
" <unk> smoke ! "
said long <name> , climbing out covered with salt and <unk> .
" d 'ye <unk> his tale av the kid an ' the little <unk> rig was thrue ? "
" i knew it all along , " said <name> .
" come an ' see dad mistook in his judgments . "
they came delightedly , just in time to hear cheyne say : " i 'm glad he has a good character , because  he 's my son . "
disko 's jaw fell ,  long <name> always vowed that he heard the click of it ,  and he stared alternately at the man and the woman .
" i got his telegram in san <name> four days ago , and we came over . "
" in a private car ? "
said <name> .
" he said ye might . "
" in a private car , of course . "
<name> looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks .
" there was a tale he tould us av drivin ' four little ponies in a rig av his own , " said long <name> .
" was that thrue now ? "
" very likely , " said cheyne .
" was it , mama ? "
" he had a little drag when we were in <unk> , i think , " said the mother .
long <name> whistled .
" oh , disko ! "
said he , and that was all .
" i wuz  i am mistook in my <unk>  <unk> the men o ' <unk> , " said disko , as though the words were being <unk> out of him .
" i do n't mind <unk> ' to you , mister cheyne , as i mistrusted the boy to be crazy .
he talked kinder odd about money . "
" so he told me . "
" did he tell ye anything else ?
'cause i pounded him once . "
this with a somewhat anxious glance at mrs. cheyne .
" oh , yes , " cheyne replied .
" i should say it probably did him more good than anything else in the world . "
" i <unk> <unk> necessary , er i would n't <name> ' done it .
i do n't want you to think we abuse our boys any on this packet . "
" i do n't think you do , mr .
troop . "
mrs. cheyne had been looking at the faces  disko 's <unk> , hairless , iron countenance ; uncle salters 's , with its rim of agricultural hair ; penn 's bewildered simplicity ; <name> 's quiet smile ; long <name> 's grin of delight ; and <name> platt 's scar .
rough , by her standards , they certainly were ; but she had a mother 's wits in her eyes , and she rose with outstretched hands .
" oh , tell me , which is who ? "
said she , half sobbing .
" i want to thank you and bless you  all of you . "
" <name> , that pays me a hunder time , " said long <name> .
disko introduced them all in due form .
the captain of an old-time chinaman could have done no better , and mrs. cheyne babbled <unk> .
she nearly threw herself into <name> 's arms when she understood that he had first found <name> .
" but how shall i leave him <unk> ? "
said poor <name> .
" what do you yourself if you find him so ?
eh , wha-at ' ?
we are in one good boy , and i am ever so pleased he come to be your son . "
" and he told me <name> was his partner ! "
she cried .
<name> was already sufficiently pink , but he turned a <name> crimson when mrs. cheyne kissed him on both cheeks before the assembly .
then they led her forward to show her the fo'c'sle , at which she wept again , and must needs go down to see <name> 's identical bunk , and there she found the nigger cook cleaning up the stove , and he nodded as though she were some one he had expected to meet for years .
they tried , two at a time , to explain the boat 's daily life to her , and she sat by the <unk> , her gloved hands on the greasy table , laughing with trembling lips and crying with dancing eyes .
" and who 's ever to use the " we 're here " after this ? "
said long <name> to <name> platt .
" i feel it as if she 'd made a cathedral av ut all . "
" cathedral ! "
sneered <name> platt .
" oh , ef it had bin even the fish <unk> boat instid o ' this <unk> o ' blazes .
ef we only hed some decency an ' order an ' <unk> when she goes over !
she 'll have to climb that ladder like a hen , an ' we  we ought to be <unk> ' the yards ! "
" then <name> was not mad , " said penn , slowly , to cheyne .
" no , indeed  thank god , " the big millionaire replied , stooping down tenderly .
" it must be terrible to be mad .
except to lose your child , i do not know anything more terrible .
but your child has come back ?
let us thank god for that . "
" hello ! "
said <name> , looking down upon them <unk> from the wharf .
" i wuz mistook , harve .
i wuz mistook , " said disko , swiftly , holding up a hand .
" i wuz mistook in my <unk> .
ye need n't rub it in any more . "
" 'guess i 'll take care o ' that , " said <name> , under his breath .
" you 'll be goin ' off naow , wo n't ye ? "
" well , not without the balance of my wages , 'less you want to have the " we 're here " attached . "
" thet 's so ; i 'd clean forgot " ; and he counted out the remaining dollars .
" you done all you contracted to do , harve ; and you done it <unk> 's well as ef you 'd been brought up  " here disko brought himself up .
he did not quite see where the sentence was going to end .
" outside of a private car ? "
suggested <name> , wickedly .
" come on , and i 'll show her to you , " said <name> .
cheyne stayed to talk to disko , but the others made a procession to the depot , with mrs. cheyne at the head .
the french maid shrieked at the invasion ; and <name> laid the glories of the " <name> " before them without a word .
they took them in in equal silence  stamped leather , silver <unk> and rails , cut <name> , plate-glass , nickel , bronze , hammered iron , and the rare woods of the continent inlaid .
" i told you , " said <name> ; " i told you . "
this was his crowning revenge , and a most ample one .
mrs. cheyne decreed a meal ; and that nothing might be lacking to the tale long <name> told afterwards in his boarding-house , she waited on them herself .
men who are accustomed to eat at <name> tables in howling gales have curiously neat and finished <unk> ; but mrs. cheyne , who did not know this , was surprised .
she longed to have <name> for a butler ; so silently and easily did he <unk> himself among the frail <unk> and dainty silver .
<name> platt remembered great days on the ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers ; and long <name> , being <name> , supplied the small talk till all were at their ease .
in the " we 're here 's " cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind their cigars .
cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom he could not offer money ; equally well he knew that no money could pay for what disko had done .
he kept his own counsel and waited for an opening .
" i hev n't done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep ' make him work a piece an ' learn him how to handle the <unk> , " said disko .
" he has twice my boy 's head for <unk> . "
" by the way , " cheyne answered casually , " what d'you calculate to make of your boy ? "
disko removed his cigar and waved it <unk> round the cabin .
" <name> 's jest plain boy , an ' he do n't allow me to do any of his thinkin ' .
he 'll hev this able little packet when i 'm laid by .
he ai n't <unk> anxious to quit the business .
i know that . "
" <unk> !
<unk> been west , mr .
troop ? "
" bin 's fer ez noo york once in a boat .
i 've no use for railroads .
no more hez <name> .
salt water 's good enough fer the troops .
i 've been 'most everywhere  in the <unk> way , o ' course . "
" i can give him all the salt water he 's likely to need  till he 's a skipper . "
" haow 's that ?
i thought you wuz a kinder railroad king .
harve told me so when  i was mistook in my <unk> . "
" we 're all apt to be mistaken .
i fancied perhaps you might know i own a line of <unk>  san <name> to yokohama  six of 'em  <unk> , about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece . "
" blame that boy !
he never told .
i 'd <name> ' listened to that , instid o ' his truck abaout railroads an ' <unk> . "
" he did n't know . "
" 'little thing like that slipped his mind , i guess . "
" no , i only capt  took hold of the <unk> m. ' <unk>  <name> and <unk> 's old line  this summer . "
disko collapsed where he sat , beside the stove .
" great caesar almighty !
i mistrust i 've bin fooled from one end to the other .
why , <name> <unk> he went from this very town six year back  no , seven  an ' he 's mate on the san josé now  twenty-six days was her time out .
his sister she 's livin ' here yet , an ' she reads his letters to my woman .
an ' you own the <unk> m. ' <unk> ? "
cheyne nodded .
" if i 'd known that i 'd <name> ' jerked the " we 're here " back to port all standin ' , on the word . "
" perhaps that would n't have been so good for <name> . "
" ef i 'd only known !
ef he 'd only said about the cussed line , i 'd ha' understood !
i 'll never stand on my own <unk> again  never .
they're <unk> packets , <name> <unk> he says so . "
" i 'm glad to have a recommend from that quarter .
<unk> 's skipper of the san josé now .
what i was getting at is to know whether you 'd lend me <name> for a year or two , and we 'll see if we ca n't make a mate of him .
would you trust him to <unk> ? "
" it 's a resk taking a raw boy  " " i know a man who did more for me . "
" that 's <unk> .
look at here naow , i ai n't <unk> ' <name> special because he 's my own flesh an ' blood .
i know bank ways ai n't <unk> ways , but he <name> n't much to learn .
steer he can  no boy better , ef i say it  an ' the rest 's in our blood an ' get ; but i could wish he warn't so cussed weak on navigation . "
" <unk> <name> attend to that .
he 'll ship as a boy for a voyage or two , and then we can put him in the way of doing better .
suppose you take him in hand this <name> , and i 'll send for him early in the spring .
i know the pacific 's a long ways off  " " pshaw !
we troops , livin ' an ' dead , are all around the earth an ' the seas thereof . "
" but i want you to understand  and i mean this  any time you think you 'd like to see him , tell me , and i 'll attend to the transportation .
'two n't cost you a cent . "
" ef you 'll walk a piece with me , we 'll go to my house an ' talk this to my woman .
i 've bin so crazy mistook in all my <unk> , it do n't seem to me this was like to be real . "
they went over to troop 's <unk> , <unk> white house , with a retired dory full of <unk> in the front yard and a shuttered parlor which was a museum of <unk> plunder .
there sat a large woman , silent and grave , with the dim eyes of those who look long to sea for the return of their beloved .
cheyne addressed himself to her , and she gave consent wearily .
" we lose one hundred a year from gloucester only , mr. cheyne , " she said  " one hundred boys an ' men ; and i 've come so 's to hate the sea as if <unk> alive an ' <unk> ' .
god never made it fer humans to anchor on .
these packets o ' yours they go straight out , i take it , and straight home again ? "
" as straight as the winds let 'em , and i give a <unk> for record passages .
tea do n't improve by being at sea . "
" when he wuz little he used to play at keeping store , an ' i had hopes he might follow that up .
but soon 's he could paddle a dory i knew that were goin ' to be denied me . "
" they 're <unk> , mother ; <unk> an ' well found .
remember what <name> 's sister reads you when she gits his letters . "
" i 've never known as <name> told lies , but he 's too <unk> ( like most of 'em that use the sea ) .
ef <name> sees fit , mr. cheyne , he can go  fer all o ' me . "
" she jest despises the ocean , " disko explained , " an ' i  i dunno haow to act polite , i guess , er i 'd thank you better . "
" my father  my own eldest brother  two nephews  an ' my second <unk> man , " she said , dropping her head on her hand .
" would you care fer any one that took all those ? "
cheyne was relieved when <name> turned up and accepted with more delight than he was able to put into words .
indeed , the offer meant a plain and sure road to all desirable things ; but <name> thought most of commanding watch on broad decks , and looking into far-away harbours .
mrs. cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable <name> in the matter of <name> 's rescue .
he seemed to have no <name> for money .
pressed hard , he said that he would take five dollars , because he wanted to buy something for a girl .
otherwise  " how shall i take money when i make so easy my eats and smokes ?
you <name> <unk> some if i like or no ?
eh , wha-at ?
then you shall <unk> me money , but not that way .
you shall <unk> all you can think . "
he introduced her to a <unk> portuguese priest with a list of <unk> widows as long as his <unk> .
as a strict <unk> , mrs. cheyne could not sympathise with the creed , but she ended by respecting the brown , <unk> little man .
<name> , faithful son of the church , appropriated all the blessings showered on her for her <name> .
" that <unk> me out , " said he .
" i have now ver ' good <unk> for six months " ; and he strolled forth to get a handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all the others .
salters went west for a season with penn , and left no address behind .
he had a dread that these <unk> people , with wasteful private cars , might take undue interest in his companion .
it was better to visit inland relatives till the coast was clear .
" never you be adopted by <name> folk , penn , " he said in the cars , " or i 'll take 'n ' break this <unk> over your head .
ef you forgit your name agin  which is pratt  you remember you belong with salters troop , an ' set down right where you are till i come fer you .
do n't go <unk> ' araound after them whose eyes bung out with <unk> , accordin ' to <unk> . "
chapter x but it was otherwise with the " we 're here 's " silent cook , for he came up , his <name> in a handkerchief , and boarded the " <name> . "
pay was no particular object , and he did not in the least care where he slept .
his business , as revealed to him in dreams , was to follow <name> for the rest of his days .
they tried argument and , at last , persuasion ; but there is a difference between one cape <unk> and two alabama negroes , and the matter was referred to cheyne by the cook and <name> .
the millionaire only laughed .
he presumed <name> might need a body-servant some day or other , and was sure that one volunteer was worth five hirelings .
let the man stay , therefore ; even though he called himself <unk> and swore in <unk> .
the car could go back to boston , where , if he were still of the same mind , they would take him west .
with the " <name> , " which in his heart of hearts he loathed , departed the last remnant of cheyne 's <unk> , and he gave himself up to an energetic idleness .
this gloucester was a new town in a new land , and he purposed to " take it in , " as of old he had taken in all the cities from <unk> to san <name> of that world whence he hailed .
they made money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half ship 's store : as a leading professional he wished to learn how the <name> game was played .
men said that four out of every five <unk> served at new england 's <name> breakfast came from gloucester , and overwhelmed him with figures in proof  statistics of boats , gear , <unk> , capital invested , <unk> , packing , factories , insurance , wages , repairs , and profits .
he talked with the owners of the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men , and whose crews were almost all swedes or portuguese .
then he conferred with disko , one of the few who owned their craft , and compared notes in his vast head .
he coiled himself away on <unk> in <name> <unk> , asking questions with cheerful , <unk> western curiosity , till all the <unk> wanted to know " what in thunder that man was after , anyhow . "
he <unk> into the mutual insurance rooms , and demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the <unk> day by day ; and that brought down upon him secretaries of every fisherman 's widow and orphan aid society within the city limits .
they begged shamelessly , each man anxious to beat the other institution 's record , and cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them all over to mrs. cheyne .
she was resting in a boarding-house near eastern point  a strange establishment , managed , apparently , by the boarders , where the <unk> were <unk> , and the population , who seemed to have known one another intimately for years , rose up at midnight to make welsh <unk> if it felt hungry .
on the second morning of her stay mrs. cheyne put away her <name> <unk> before she came down to breakfast .
" they 're most delightful people , " she confided to her husband ; " so friendly and simple , too , though they are all boston , nearly . "
" that is n't <unk> , mama , " he said , looking across the boulders behind the <unk> where the <unk> were slung .
" it 's the other thing , that we  that i have n't got . "
" it ca n't be , " said mrs. cheyne , quietly .
" there is n't a woman here owns a dress that cost a hundred dollars .
why , we  " " i know it , dear .
we have  of course we have .
i guess it 's only the style they wear east .
are you having a good time ? "
" i do n't see very much of <name> ; he 's always with you ; but i ain't near as nervous as i was . "
" i have n't had such a good time since <name> died .
i never rightly understood that i had a son before this .
harve 's got to be a great boy .
<unk> i can fetch you , dear ?
<unk> under your head ?
well , we'll go down to the wharf again and look around . "
<name> was his father 's shadow in those days , and the two strolled along side by side , cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his hand on the boy 's square shoulder .
it was then that <name> noticed and admired what had never struck him before  his father 's curious power of getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street .
" how d'you make 'em tell you everything without opening your head ? "
demanded the son , as they came out of a <unk> 's loft .
" i 've dealt with quite a few men in my time , harve , and one sizes 'em up somehow , i guess .
i know something about myself , too . "
then , after a pause , as they sat down on a <unk> : " men can 'most always tell when a man has handled things for himself , and then they treat him as one of themselves . "
" same as they treat me down at <unk> 's wharf .
i 'm one of the crowd now .
disko has told every one i 've earned my pay . "
<name> spread out his hands and rubbed the palms together .
" they 're all soft again , " he said dolefully .
" keep 'em that way for the next few years , while you 're getting your education .
you can <unk> 'em up after . "
" ye-es , i suppose so , " was the reply , in no delighted voice .
" it rests with you , harve .
you can take cover behind your mama , of course , and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your <unk> and all that kind of <unk> . "
" have i ever done that ? "
said <name> , uneasily .
his father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand .
" you know as well as i do that i ca n't make anything of you if you do n't act straight by me .
i can handle you alone if you 'll stay alone , but i do n't pretend to manage both you and mama .
life 's too short , anyway . "
" do n't make me out much of a fellow , does it ? "
" i guess it was my fault a good deal ; but if you want the truth , you have n't been much of anything up to date .
now , have you ? "
" <unk> !
disko thinks .
.
.
say , what d'you reckon it 's cost you to raise me from the start  first , last , and all over ? "
cheyne smiled .
" i 've never kept track , but i should estimate , in dollars and cents , nearer fifty than forty thousand ; maybe sixty .
the young generation comes high .
it has to have things , and it tires of 'em , and  the old man <unk> the <name> . "
<name> whistled , but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his <unk> had cost so much .
" and all that 's sunk capital , is n't it ? "
" invested , harve .
invested , i <name> . "
" making it only thirty thousand , the thirty i 've earned is about ten cents on the hundred .
that 's a mighty poor catch . "
<name> wagged his head solemnly .
cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water .
" disko has got a heap more than that out of <name> since he was ten ; and <name> 's at school half the year , too . "
" oh , that 's what you 're after , is it ? "
" no .
i 'm not after anything .
i 'm not stuck on myself any just now  that 's all .
.
.
.
i ought to be kicked . "
" i ca n't do it , old man ; or i would , i presume , if i 'd been made that way . "
" then i 'd have remembered it to the last day i lived  and never forgiven you , " said <name> , his <name> on his doubled fists .
" exactly .
that 's about what i 'd do .
you see ? "
" i see .
the fault 's with me and no one else .
all the <unk> , <unk> got to be done about it . "
cheyne <name> a cigar from his <unk> , bit off the end , and fell to smoking .
father and son were very much alike ; for the beard hid cheyne 's mouth , and <name> had his father 's slightly <unk> nose , <unk> black eyes , and narrow , high cheek-bones .
with a touch of brown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a red indian of the <unk> .
" now you can go on from here , " said cheyne , slowly , " <unk> me between six or eight thousand a year till you 're a <unk> .
well , we 'll call you a man then .
you can go right on from that , living on me to the tune of forty or fifty thousand , besides what your mother <name> give you , with a valet and a yacht or a <unk> where you can pretend to raise trotting stock and play cards with your own crowd . "
" like <unk> tuck ? "
<name> put in .
" <unk> ; or the two de <unk> boys or old man <unk> 's son .
<unk> full of 'em , and here 's an eastern sample while we 're talking . "
a shiny black <unk> , with mahogany <unk> , nickel-plated <unk> , and <unk> awnings , puffed up the harbour , flying the <unk> of some new york club .
two young men , in what they conceived to be sea costumes , were playing cards by the saloon skylight ; and a couple of women with red and blue <unk> looked on and laughed <unk> .
" should n't care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze .
no , beam , " said <name> , critically , as the yacht slowed to pick up her <unk> .
" they 're having what stands them for a good time .
i can give you that , and twice as much as that , harve .
how 'd you like it ? "
" caesar !
that 's no way to get a dinghy <unk> , " said <name> , still intent on the yacht .
" if i could n't slip a tackle better than that i'd stay ashore .
.
.
.
what if i do n't ? "
" stay ashore  or what ? "
" yacht and ranch and live on 'the old man , ' and  get behind mama when there 's trouble , " said <name> , with a twinkle in his eye .
" why , in that case , you come right in with me , my son . "
" ten dollars a month ? "
another twinkle .
" not a cent more until you 're worth it , and you wo n't begin to touch that for a few years . "
" i 'd sooner begin sweeping out the office  is n't that how the big bugs start ?  and touch something now than  " " i know it ; we all feel that way .
but i guess we can hire any sweeping we need .
i made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon . "
" thirty million dollars ' worth o ' mistake , was n't it ?
i 'd risk it for that . "
" i lost some ; and i gained some .
i 'll tell you . "
cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water , and spoke away from <name> , who presently began to be aware that his father was telling the story of his life .
he talked in a low , even voice , without gesture and without expression ; and it was a history for which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many dollars  the story of forty years that was at the same time the story of the new west , whose story is yet to be written .
it began with a <unk> boy turned loose in texas , and went on fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life , the scenes shifting from state after western state , from cities that sprang up in a month and in a season utterly withered away , to wild ventures in wilder camps that are now laborious , paved <unk> .
it covered the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth .
it told of steamers , <unk> , forests , and mines , and the men of every nation under heaven , manning , creating , <unk> , and digging these .
it touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that could not see , or missed by the merest accident of time and travel ; and through the mad shift of things , sometimes on horseback , more often afoot , now <name> , now poor , in and out , and back and forth , <unk> , <unk> , contractor , <unk> keeper , journalist , engineer , drummer , real-estate agent , politician , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or tramp , moved <name> cheyne , alert and quiet , seeking his own ends , and , so he said , the <name> and advancement of his country .
he told of the <name> that never deserted him even when he <name> on the ragged edge of despair the <name> that comes of knowing men and things .
he enlarged , as though he were talking to himself , on his very great courage and resource at all times .
the thing was so evident in the man 's mind that he never even changed his tone .
he described how he had <unk> his enemies , or forgiven them , exactly as they had <unk> or forgiven him in those careless days ; how he had entreated , <unk> , and bullied towns , companies , and <unk> , all for their enduring good ; crawled round , through , or under mountains and ravines , dragging a string and <unk> railroad after him , and in the end , how he had sat still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his character to shreds .
the tale held <name> almost breathless , his head a little cocked to one side , his eyes fixed on his father 's face , as the twilight deepened and the red <unk> lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows .
it seemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the dark  a mile between each glare of the opened <unk> : but this locomotive could talk , and the words shook and stirred the boy to the core of his soul .
at last cheyne pitched away the <unk> , and the two sat in the dark over the lapping water .
" i 've never told that to any one before , " said the father .
<name> gasped .
" it 's just the greatest thing that ever was ! "
said he .
" that 's what i got .
now i 'm coming to what i did n't get .
it wo n't sound much of anything to you , but i do n't wish you to be as old as i am before you find out .
i can handle men , of course , and i 'm no fool along my own lines , but  but i ca n't compete with the man who has been taught !
i 've picked up as i went along , and i guess it sticks out all over me . "
" i 've never seen it , " said the son , indignantly .
" you <name> , though , harve .
you <name>  just as soon as you 're through college .
do n't i know it ?
do n't i know the look on men 's faces when they think me a  a <unk> , ' as they call it out here ?
i can break them to little pieces  yes  but i ca n't get back at 'em to hurt 'em where they live .
i do n't say they 're 'way , 'way up , but i feel i 'm 'way , 'way , 'way off , somehow .
now you 've got your chance .
you 've got to soak up all the learning that 's around , and you 'll live with a crowd that are doing the same thing .
they 'll be doing it for a few thousand dollars a year at most ; but remember you 'll be doing it for millions .
you 'll learn law enough to look after your own property when i 'm out o' the light , and you 'll have to be solid with the best men in the market ( they are useful later ) ; and above all , you 'll have to stow away the plain , common , <unk> <unk> .
nothing pays like that , harve , and it 's bound to pay more and more each year in our country  in business and in politics .
you 'll see . "
" there 's no sugar my end of the deal , " said <name> .
" four years at college !
wish i 'd chosen the valet and the yacht ! "
" never mind , my son , " cheyne insisted .
" you 're investing your capital where it 'll bring in the best returns ; and i guess you wo n't find our property shrunk any when you 're ready to take hold .
think it over , and let me know in the morning .
hurry !
we 'll be late for supper ! "
as this was a business talk , there was no need for <name> to tell his mother about it ; and cheyne naturally took the same point of view .
but mrs. cheyne saw and feared , and was a little jealous .
her boy , who rode <unk> over her , was gone , and in his stead reigned a <unk> youth , abnormally silent , who addressed most of his conversation to his father .
she understood it was business , and therefore a matter beyond her premises .
if she had any doubts , they were resolved when cheyne went to boston and brought back a new <name> <unk> .
" what have you two men been doing now ? "
she said , with a weak little smile , as she turned it in the light .
" talking  just talking , mama ; there 's nothing mean about <name> . "
there was not .
the boy had made a treaty on his own account .
railroads , he explained gravely , interested him as little as lumber , real estate , or mining .
what his soul yearned after was control of his father's newly purchased <unk> .
if that could be promised him within what he conceived to be a reasonable time , he , for his part , guaranteed diligence and <unk> at college for four or five years .
in vacation he was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the line ,  he had asked not more than two thousand questions about it ,  from his father 's most private papers in the safe to the tug in san <name> harbour .
" it 's a deal , " said cheyne at the last .
" you 'll alter your mind twenty times before you leave college , o ' course ; but if you take hold of it in proper shape , and if you do n't tie it up before you 're twenty-three , i 'll make the thing over to you .
how 's that , harve ? "
" <unk> ; never pays to split up a going concern there 's too much competition in the world anyway , and disko says <unk> hev to stick together . '
his crowd never go back on him .
that 's one reason , he says , why they make such big fares .
say , the " we 're here " goes off to the <unk> on monday .
they do n't stay long ashore , do they ? "
" well , we ought to be going , too , i guess .
i 've left my business <name> up at loose ends between two oceans , and it 's time to connect again .
i just hate to do it , though ; have n't had a holiday like this for twenty years . "
" we ca n't go without seeing disko off , " said <name> ; " and <unk> memorial day .
let 's stay over that , anyway . "
" what is this memorial business ?
they were talking about it at the boarding-house , " said cheyne , weakly .
he , too , was not anxious to spoil the golden days .
" well , as far as i can make out , this business is a sort of <unk> act , whacked up for the summer boarders .
disko don't think much of it , he says , because they take up a collection for the widows and orphans .
disko 's independent .
have n't you noticed that ? "
" well  yes .
a little .
in spots .
is it a town show , then ? "
" the summer convention is .
they read out the names of the fellows drowned or gone astray since last time , and they make speeches , and recite , and all .
then , disko says , the secretaries of the aid societies go into the back yard and fight over the catch .
the real show , he says , is in the spring .
the ministers all take a hand then , and there aren't any summer boarders around . "
" i see , " said cheyne , with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of one born into and bred up to city pride .
" we 'll stay over for memorial day , and get off in the afternoon . "
" guess i 'll go down to disko 's and make him bring his crowd up before they sail .
i 'll have to stand with them , of course . "
" oh , that 's it , is it , " said cheyne .
" i 'm only a poor summer boarder , and you 're  " " a banker  <unk> banker , " <name> called back as he boarded a trolley , and cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future .
disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for <name> , but <name> pleaded that the <name> of the day would be lost , so far as he was concerned , if the " we 're <unk> " <unk> themselves .
then disko made conditions .
he had heard  it was astonishing how all the world knew all the world 's business along the <unk>  he had heard that a " philadelphia <unk> " was going to take part in the exercises ; and he mistrusted that she would deliver " skipper <unk> ride . "
personally , he had as little use for <unk> as for summer boarders ; but justice was justice , and though he himself ( here <name> giggled ) had once slipped up on a matter of judgment , this thing must not be .
so <name> came back to east gloucester , and spent half a day explaining to an amused actress with a <name> reputation on two <unk> the <unk> of the mistake she contemplated ; and she admitted that it was justice , even as disko had said .
cheyne knew by old experience what would happen ; but anything of the nature of a public <unk> was meat and drink to the man 's soul .
he saw the <unk> hurrying west , in the hot , hazy morning , full of women in light summer dresses , and <unk> <unk> men fresh from boston desks ; the stack of bicycles outside the post-office ; the <unk> of busy officials , greeting one another ; the slow <unk> and <unk> of bunting in the heavy air ; and the important man with a hose <unk> the brick sidewalk .
" mother , " he said suddenly , " do n't you remember  after seattle was burned out  and they got her going again ? "
mrs. cheyne nodded , and looked critically down the crooked street .
like her husband , she understood these gatherings , all the west over , and compared them one against another .
the fishermen began to mingle with the crowd about the <unk> doors  <unk> portuguese , their women bare-headed or <unk> for the most part ; <unk> <name> <unk> , and men of the maritime provinces ; french , italians , swedes , and danes , with outside crews of coasting schooners ; and everywhere women in black , who saluted one another with a gloomy pride , for this was their day of great days .
and there were ministers of many creeds ,  <unk> of great , gilt-edged congregations , at the seaside for a rest , with shepherds of the regular work ,  from the priests of the church on the hill to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with the men of a score of boats .
there were owners of lines of schooners , large <unk> to the societies , and small men , their few craft <unk> to the <unk> , with bankers and <unk> agents , captains of tugs and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , salters , <unk> , and <unk> , and all the mixed population of the <unk> .
they drifted along the line of seats made <name> with the dresses of the summer boarders , and one of the town officials <unk> and <unk> till he shone all over with pure civic pride .
cheyne had met him for five minutes a few days before , and between the two there was entire understanding .
" well , mr. cheyne , and what d'you think of our city ?  yes , madam , you can sit anywhere you <unk>  you have this kind of thing out west , i presume ? "
" yes , but we are n't as old as you . "
" that 's so , of course .
you ought to have been at the exercises when we celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday .
i tell you , mr. cheyne , the old city did herself credit . "
" so i heard .
it pays , too .
what 's the matter with the town that it do n't have a first-class hotel , though ? "
" right over there to the left , <name> .
heaps o ' room for you and your <unk>  why , that 's what i tell 'em all the time , mr. cheyne .
there's big money in it , but i presume that do n't affect you any .
what we want is  " a heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder , and the flushed skipper of a portland <unk> <unk> spun him half round .
" what in thunder do you fellows mean by <unk> ' the law on the town when all decent men are at sea this way ?
heh ?
town 's dry 's a bone , an ' smells a sight worse sence i quit .
'might <name> ' left us one saloon for soft drinks , anyway . "
" do n't seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning , <unk> .
i 'll go into the politics of it later .
sit down by the door and think over your arguments till i come back . "
" what good 's arguments to me ?
in <unk> champagne 's eighteen dollars a case , and  " the skipper lurched into his seat as an <unk> silenced him .
" our new organ , " said the official proudly to cheyne .
" cost us four thousand dollars , too .
we 'll have to get back to <unk> next year to pay for it .
i was n't going to let the ministers have all the religion at their convention .
those are some of our orphans standing up to sing .
my wife taught 'em .
see you again later , mr. cheyne .
i'm wanted on the platform . "
high , clear , and true , children 's voices bore down the last noise of those settling into their places .
" o all ye works of the lord , bless ye the lord : praise him , and magnify him for ever ! "
the women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated cadences filled the air .
mrs. cheyne , with some others , began to breathe short ; she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the world ; and instinctively searched for <name> .
he had found the " we're <unk> " at the back of the audience , and was standing , as by right , between <name> and disko .
uncle salters , returned the night before with penn , from <unk> sound , received him suspiciously .
" <name> n't your folk gone yet ? "
he grunted .
" what are you doin ' here , young feller ? "
" o ye seas and floods , bless ye the lord : praise him , and magnify him for ever ! "
" <name> n't he good right ? "
said <name> .
" he 's bin there , same as the rest of us . "
" not in them clothes , " salters snarled .
" shut your head , salters , " said disko .
" your <unk> 's gone back on you .
stay right where ye are , harve . "
then up and spoke the orator of the occasion , another pillar of the municipality , bidding the world welcome to gloucester , and incidentally pointing out wherein gloucester excelled the rest of the world .
then he turned to the <unk> of the city , and spoke of the price that must be paid for the yearly harvest .
they would hear later the names of their lost dead  one hundred and seventeen of them .
( the widows stared a little , and looked at one another here . )
gloucester could not boast any overwhelming mills or factories .
her sons worked for such wage as the sea gave ; and they all knew that neither <unk> nor the banks were <unk> .
the utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help the widows and the orphans ; and after a few general remarks he took this opportunity of thanking , in the name of the city , those who had so <unk> consented to participate in the exercises of the occasion .
" i jest despise the <unk> ' pieces in it , " growled disko .
" it don't give folk a fair notion of us . "
" ef folk wo n't be <unk> an ' put by when they 've the chance , " returned salters , " it stands in the nature o ' things they hev to be <unk> .
you take warnin ' by that , young feller .
riches <unk> but for a season , ef you scatter them araound on <unk>  " " but to lose everything  everything , " said penn .
" what can you do then ?
once i "  the watery blue eyes stared up and down , as looking for something to steady them  " once i read  in a book , i think  of a boat where every one was run down  except some one  and he said to me  " " shucks ! "
said salters , cutting in .
" you read a little less an ' take more <unk> in your vittles , and you 'll come nearer <unk> ' your keep , penn . "
<name> , jammed among the fishermen , felt a creepy , <unk> , tingling thrill that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots .
he was cold , too , though it was a stifling day .
" 'that the actress from philadelphia ? "
said disko troop , scowling at the platform .
" you 've fixed it about old man <unk> , <name> n't ye , harve ?
ye know why naow . "
it was not " <unk> 's ride " that the woman delivered , but some sort of poem about a <unk> called <unk> and a fleet of <unk> beating in against storm by night , while the women made a guiding fire at the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on .
" they took the <unk> 's blanket , who shivered and bade them go ; they took the baby 's cradle , who could not say them no . "
" whew ! "
said <name> , peering over long <name> 's shoulder .
" that 's great !
must <name> ' bin expensive , though . "
" <unk> case , " said the galway man .
" badly lighted port , <name> . "
" and knew not all the while if they were lighting a bonfire or only a funeral pile . "
the wonderful voice took hold of people by their <unk> ; and when she told how the drenched crews were flung ashore , living and dead , and they carried the bodies to the glare of the fires , asking : " child , is this your father ? "
or " wife , is this your man ? "
you could hear hard breathing all over the benches .
" and when the boats of <unk> go out to face the gales , think of the love that travels like light upon their sails ! "
there was very little applause when she finished .
the women were looking for their handkerchiefs , and many of the men stared at the ceiling with shiny eyes .
" h 'm , " said salters ; " that <unk> 'd cost ye a dollar to hear at any theater  maybe two .
some folk , i <unk> , can afford it .
'seems downright waste to me .
.
.
.
naow , how in jerusalem did cap <name> <unk> strike adrift here ? "
" no keepin ' him under , " said an eastport man behind .
" he 's a poet , an' he 's <unk> to say his piece .
<unk> from daown <unk> way , too . "
he did not say that captain b. <unk> had striven for five consecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own composition on gloucester memorial day .
an amused and exhausted committee had at last given him his <name> .
the simplicity and utter happiness of the old man , as he stood up in his very best <name> clothes , won the audience ere he opened his mouth .
they sat <unk> through <unk> <unk> verses describing at fullest length the loss of the schooner <name> <unk> off the <unk> in the <name> of 1867 , and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat .
a <unk> boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and an interview with the author ; so that earth had nothing more to offer captain <name> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and poet , in the <unk> year of his age .
" naow , i call that sensible , " said an eastport man .
" i 've bin over that <unk> with his <unk> ' , jest as he read it , in my two hands , and i can testify that he 's got it all in . "
" if <name> here could n't do better'n that with one hand before breakfast , he ought to be switched , " said salters , <unk> the honour of massachusetts on general principles .
" not but what i 'm free to own he's considerable <unk>  fer maine .
still  " " guess uncle salters 's goin ' to die this trip .
fust compliment he's ever paid me , " <name> <unk> .
" what 's wrong with you , harve ?
you act all quiet and you look greenish .
feelin ' sick ? "
" do n't know what 's the matter with me , " <name> replied .
" seems if my insides were too big for my <unk> .
i 'm all crowded up and <unk> . "
" <unk> ?
<unk> bad .
we 'll wait for the <unk> ' , an ' then we'll quit , an ' catch the tide . "
the widows  they were nearly all of that season 's making  braced themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood , for they knew what was coming .
the <unk> girls in pink and blue <unk> stopped <unk> over captain <unk> 's wonderful poem , and looked back to see why all was silent .
the fishermen pressed forward as that town official who had talked with cheyne bobbed up on the platform and began to read the year 's list of losses , dividing them into months .
last <name> 's casualties were mostly single men and strangers , but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall .
" <name> <unk>  schooner " <name> <name> " lost , with all aboard , off the <unk> .
" <name> pitman , master , 50 , single , main street , city .
" <name> <unk> , 19 , single , 329 hammond street , city ; denmark .
" <name> <unk> , single , 25 , sweden .
" <name> <unk> , single , 28 , main street , city .
" <name> , supposed madeira , single , <unk> 's boarding-house , city .
" <name> welsh , alias <name> wright , 30 , st. <name> 's , newfoundland . "
" no  <unk> , maine , " a voice cried from the body of the hall .
" he shipped from st. <name> 's , " said the reader , looking to see .
" i know it .
he belongs in <unk> .
my <unk> . "
the reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list , and resumed : " same schooner , <name> ritchie , liverpool , <name> scotia , 33 , single .
" <name> may , 267 rogers street , city , 27 , single .
" <name> <unk>  <unk> <unk> , 30 , married , drowned in dory off eastern point . "
that shot went home , for one of the widows flinched where she sat , clasping and <unk> her hands .
mrs. cheyne , who had been listening with <unk> eyes , threw up her head and choked .
<name> 's mother , a few seats to the right , saw and heard and quickly moved to her side .
the reading went on .
by the time they reached the <name> and february wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast , and the widows <name> breath between their teeth .
" february <unk>  schooner " <name> <name> " <unk> on the way home from newfoundland ; <name> <unk> , married , 32 , main street , city , lost overboard .
" february <unk>  schooner " <name> <name> " ; went astray in dory , <name> <unk> , 29 , married , native of <unk> , <name> scotia . "
but his wife was in the hall .
they heard a low cry , as though a little animal had been hit .
it was stifled at once , and a girl staggered out of the hail .
she had been hoping against <name> for months , because some who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by deep-sea <unk> .
now she had her certainty , and <name> could see the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her .
" it 's fifty cents to the depot "  the driver began , but the policeman held up his hand  " but i 'm goin ' there anyway .
jump right in .
look at here , alf ; you do n't pull me next time my lamps ai n't lit .
see ? "
the <unk> closed on the patch of bright <name> , and <name> 's eyes turned again to the reader and his endless list .
" <name> <unk>  schooner " <name> <name> " lost on the banks with all hands .
" <name> canton , 43 , master , married , city .
" d. hawkins , alias <name> , 34 , married , <unk> , <name> scotia .
" g. w. <name> , coloured , 28 , married , city . "
and so on , and so on .
great lumps were rising in <name> 's throat , and his stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner .
" may <unk>  schooner " we 're here " [ the blood tingled all over him ] .
<name> <unk> , 20 , single , city , lost overboard . "
once more a low , tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall .
" she should n't <name> ' come .
she should n't <name> ' come , " said long <name> , with a <unk> of pity .
" do n't <unk> , harve , " grunted <name> .
<name> heard that much , but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels .
disko leaned forward and spoke to his wife , where she sat with one arm round mrs. cheyne , and the other holding down the snatching , catching , ringed hands .
" <name> your head daown  right daown ! "
she whispered .
" it 'll go off in a minute . "
" i <unk> n't !
i <unk> n't !
oh , let me  " mrs. cheyne did not at all know what she said .
" you must , " mrs. troop repeated .
" your boy 's jest fainted dead away .
they do that some when they 're gettin ' their growth .
'wish to tend to him ?
we can git aout this side .
quite quiet .
you come right along with me .
<unk> ' , my dear , we 're both women , i guess .
we must tend to <unk> <unk> .
come ! "
the " we 're <unk> " promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard , and it was a very white and shaken <name> that they propped up on a bench in an anteroom .
" favours his <name> , " was mrs. troop 's only comment , as the mother bent over her boy .
" how d'you suppose he could ever stand it ? "
she cried indignantly to cheyne , who had said nothing at all .
" it was horrible  horrible !
we should n't have come .
it 's wrong and wicked !
it  it is n't right !
why  why could n't they put these things in the papers , where they belong ?
are you better , darling ? "
that made <name> very properly ashamed .
" oh , i 'm all right , i guess , " he said , struggling to his feet , with a broken giggle .
" must <name> ' been something i ate for breakfast . "
" coffee , perhaps , " said cheyne , whose face was all in hard lines , as though it had been cut out of bronze .
" we wo n't go back again . "
" guess 'twould be <unk> 's well to git daown to the wharf , " said disko .
" it 's close in along with them <unk> , an ' the fresh air <name> fresh mrs. cheyne up . "
<name> announced that he never felt better in his life ; but it was not till he saw the " we 're here " , fresh from the <unk> 's hands , at <unk> 's wharf , that he lost his <unk> feelings in a queer mixture of pride and <unk> .
other people  summer boarders and <unk>  played about in <unk> or looked at the sea from <unk> ; but he understood things from the inside  more things than he could begin to think about .
none the less , he could have sat down and howled because the little schooner was going off .
mrs. cheyne simply cried and cried every step of the way , and said most extraordinary things to mrs. troop , who " <unk> " her till <name> , who had not been " <unk> " since he was six , whistled aloud .
and so the old crowd  <name> felt like the most ancient of mariners  dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories , while <name> slipped the <unk> from the <unk> , and they slid her along the <unk> with their hands .
every one wanted to say so much that no one said anything in particular .
<name> bade <name> take care of uncle salters 's <unk> and penn 's <unk> , and long <name> entreated <name> to remember his lessons in <unk> ; but the jokes fell flat in the presence of the two women , and it is hard to be funny with green <unk> widening between good friends .
" up jib and <unk> !
" shouted disko , getting to the wheel , as the wind took her .
" see you later , harve .
dunno but i come near thinkin ' a heap o ' you an ' your folks . "
then she glided beyond <unk> , and they sat down to watch her up the harbour .
and still mrs. cheyne wept .
" <unk> ' , my dear , " said mrs. troop ; " we 're both women , i guess .
<unk> not it 'll ease your heart to hev your cry aout .
god he knows it never done me a mite o ' good ; but then he knows i 've had something to cry fer ! "
now it was a few years later , and upon the other edge of <name> , that a young man came through the clammy <unk> up a <name> street which is flanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone .
to him , as he was standing by a hammered iron gate , entered on horseback  and the horse would have been cheap at a thousand dollars  another young man .
and this is what they said : " hello , <name> ! "
" hello , harve ! "
" what 's the best with you ? "
" well , i 'm so 's to be that kind o ' animal called second mate this trip .
ai n't you most through with that <unk> college o ' yours ? "
" getting that way .
i tell you , the <name> <name> <name> is n't a circumstance to the old " we 're here " ; but i 'm coming into the business for keeps next fall . "
" meanin ' <unk> packets ? "
" nothing else .
you just wait till i get my knife into you , <name> .
i'm going to make the old line lie down and cry when i take hold . "
" i 'll resk it , " said <name> , with a brotherly grin , as <name> dismounted and asked whether he were coming in .
" that 's what i took the cable fer ; but , say , is the doctor anywheres araound ?
i 'll <unk> that crazy nigger some day , his one cussed joke an ' all . "
there was a low , triumphant chuckle , as the <unk> of the " we 're here " came out of the fog to take the horse 's bridle .
he allowed no one but himself to attend to any of <name> 's wants .
" thick as the banks , ai n't it , doctor ? "
said <name> , <unk> .
but the coal-black <unk> with the <unk> did not see fit to reply till he had tapped <name> on the shoulder , and for the twentieth time croaked the old , old prophecy in his ear : " master  man .
man  master , " said he .
" you remember , <name> troop , what i said ?
on the 'we 're here ' ? "
" well , i wo n't go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things stand at present , " said <name> .
" she was an able packet , and one way an' another i owe her a heap  her and dad . "
" me too , " quoth <name> cheyne .

i have written the tale of our life for a sheltered people 's mirth , in jesting guise  but ye are wise , and ye know what the jest is worth .
general summary we are very slightly changed from the <unk> who ranged <name> 's prehistoric <name> ; whoso <name> the longest bow , ran his brother down , you know , as we run men down today .
" <unk> , " the first of all his race , met the mammoth face to face on the lake or in the cave , stole the <unk> canoe , ate the quarry others slew , died  and took the finest grave .
when they scratched the <unk> someone made the sketch his own , <unk> it from the artist  then , even in those early days , won a simple viceroy 's praise through the toil of other men .
ere they <unk> the sphinx 's visage <unk> governed <unk> , even as it does in this age .
who shall doubt the secret hid under <unk> ' pyramid was that the contractor did <unk> out of several millions ?
or that <name> 's sudden rise to <unk> of supplies was a fraud of monstrous size on king <unk> 's <unk> civilians ?
thus , the artless songs i sing do not deal with anything new or never said before .
as it was in the beginning , is today official <unk> , and shall be forevermore .
army headquarters old is the song that i sing  old as my unpaid bills  old as the chicken that <unk> bring men at <unk>  old as the hills .
<unk> jenkins of the " <unk> own " was <unk> with a tenor voice of <unk> tone .
his views on <unk> were , perhaps , a trifle queer ; he had no seat worth mentioning , but oh !
he had an ear .
he clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day , he used to quit his charger in a <unk> way , his method of saluting was the <name> of all beholders , but <unk> jenkins had a head upon his shoulders .
he took two months to simla when the year was at the spring , and underneath the deodars eternally did sing .
he <unk> like a <unk> , but particularly at <name> agrippina who was musical and fat .
she controlled a humble husband , who , in turn , controlled a <unk> , where <name> agrippina 's human <unk> were kept from <name> to october on a plump retaining fee , supplied , of course , per <unk> , by the indian treasury .
<name> used to sing with him , and jenkins used to play ; he praised <unk> her notes , for he was false as they : so when the winds of <name> turned the budding roses brown , <name> told her husband : " <name> , you must n't send him down . "
they haled him from his regiment which did n't much regret him ; they found for him an <unk> , and on that stool they set him , to play with maps and <unk> three idle hours a day , and draw his plump retaining fee  which means his double pay .
now , ever after dinner , when the <unk> are brought , <unk> <unk> o'er the grand <unk> ; and , thanks to fair <name> , his fame hath waxen great , and <unk> jenkins is a power in the state .
study of an elevation , in indian ink this ditty is a string of lies .
but  how the deuce did <unk> rise ?
potiphar <unk> , c. e. , stands at the top of the tree ; and i muse in my bed on the reasons that led to the hoisting of potiphar g. potiphar <unk> , c. e. , is seven years <name> to me ; each bridge that he makes he either buckles or breaks , and his work is as rough as he .
potiphar <unk> , c. e. , is coarse as a chimpanzee ; and i ca n't understand why you gave him your hand , lovely <unk> <name> .
potiphar <unk> , c. e. , is dear to the powers that be ; for they bow and they smile in an affable style which is seldom accorded to me .
potiphar <unk> , c. e. , is certain as certain can be of a <unk> post which is claimed by a host of seniors  including me .
careless and lazy is he , greatly inferior to me .
what is the spell that you manage so well , commonplace potiphar g. ?
lovely <unk> <name> , let me inquire of thee , should i have <unk> to what potiphar is , <unk> thou been mated to me ?
a legend this is the reason why <unk> beg , rajah of <unk> , <unk> the " <unk> " and <name> <name> , maketh the money to fly , <unk> a government , tender and kind , also  but this is a detail  blind .
<unk> beg of <unk>  slightly backward native state <unk> for a c. s. i. ,  so began to <unk> .
built a jail and hospital  nearly built a city drain  till his faithful subjects all thought their ruler was insane .
strange departures made he then  yea , departments stranger still , half a dozen englishmen helped the rajah with a <name> , talked of <name> aims and high , hinted of a future fine for the state of <unk> , on a strictly western line .
rajah <unk> held his peace ; lowered <unk> dues a half ; organized a state police ; purified the civil staff ; settled <unk> and tax afresh in a very liberal way ; cut temptations of the flesh  also cut the <unk> 's pay ; roused his <unk> to a fine mahratta fury , by a <unk> hinting at supervision of <unk> ; turned the state of <unk> very nearly upside-down ; when the end of may was nigh , waited his achievement crown .
when the birthday honors came , sad to state and sad to see , stood against the rajah 's name nothing more than c. i. e. !
* * * * * things were lively for a week in the state of <unk> .
even now the people speak of that time regretfully .
how he <unk> the jail  stopped at once the city drain ; turned to beauty fair and frail  got his senses back again ; doubled taxes , <unk> , all ; cleared away each <unk> thana ; turned the <unk> hospital into a superb zenana ; heaped upon the <unk> sahib wealth and honors manifold ; clad himself in eastern garb  squeezed his people as of old .
happy , happy <unk> !
never more <name> <unk> beg play to catch the viceroy 's eye .
he prefers the " <unk> " <name> .
the story of uriah " now there were two men in one city ; the one <name> and the other poor . "
<name> <name> went to quetta because they told him to .
he left his wife at simla on three-fourths his monthly screw : <name> <name> died at quetta ere the next month 's pay he <name> .
<name> <name> went to quetta .
he did n't understand the reason of his transfer from the pleasant <unk> : the season was <name> , and it killed him out of hand .
<name> <name> went to quetta , and there gave up the ghost , attempting two men 's duty in that very healthy post ; and mrs. <name> mourned for him five lively months at most .
<name> <name> 's bones at quetta enjoy profound repose ; but i should n't be astonished if now his spirit knows the reason of his transfer from the himalayan snows .
and , when the last great bugle call <unk> the <unk> <unk> , when the last grim joke is entered in the big black book of jobs , and quetta graveyards give again their victims to the air , i should n't like to be the man who sent <name> <name> there .
the post that fitted though tangled and twisted the course of true love this ditty explains , no tangle 's so tangled it can not improve if the lover has brains .
ere the steamer bore him eastward , sleary was engaged to marry an attractive girl at <unk> , whom he called " my little <name> . "
sleary 's pay was very modest ; sleary was the other way .
who can cook a <unk> dinner on eight poor rupees a day ?
long he pondered o'er the question in his <unk> furnished quarters  then proposed to <name> <unk> , eldest of judge <unk> 's daughters .
certainly an <unk> subaltern was not a catch , but the <unk> knew that <name> might n't make another match .
so they recognised the business and , to feed and clothe the bride , got him made a something something somewhere on the bombay side .
anyhow , the billet carried pay enough for him to marry  as the artless sleary put it :  " just the thing for me and <name> . "
did he , therefore , <unk> miss <unk>  impulse of a baser mind ?
no !
he started epileptic fits of an appalling kind .
[ of his modus <unk> only this much i could gather :  " pears 's shaving sticks <name> give you little taste and lots of lather . " ]
frequently in public places his affliction used to smite sleary with distressing vigour  always in the <unk> ' sight .
ere a week was over <name> <unk> returned his ring , told him his " unhappy weakness " stopped all thought of marrying .
sleary bore the information with a <unk> holy <name> ,  epileptic fits do n't matter in political employ ,  wired three short words to <name>  took his ticket , packed his <name>  bade farewell to <name> <unk> in one last , long , lingering fit .
four weeks later , <name> sleary read  and laughed until she wept  mrs. <unk> 's warning letter on the " wretched <unk> . " ...
year by year , in pious <name> , <unk> mrs. <unk> sits waiting for the sleary babies to develop sleary 's fits .
public waste walpole talks of " a man and his price . "
list to a ditty queer  the sale of a <unk> <unk> , bought like a bullock , hoof and hide , by the little tin gods on the mountain side .
by the laws of the family circle 't is written in letters of brass that only a colonel from chatham can manage the railways of state , because of the gold on his <unk> , and the subjects wherein he must pass ; because in all matters that deal not with railways his knowledge is great .
now exeter <unk> <unk> had laboured from boyhood to <unk> on the lines of the east and the west , and <unk> of the north and south ; many lines had he built and surveyed  important the posts which he held ; and the lords of the iron horse were dumb when he opened his mouth .
black as the <name> his garb , and his <unk> <unk> still  hinting that railways required <unk> of study and knowledge  never clanked sword by his side  <unk> he knew not nor drill  nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the " college . "
wherefore the little tin gods harried their little tin souls , seeing he came not from chatham , jingled no spurs at his heels , knowing that , nevertheless , was he first on the government rolls for the billet of " railway instructor to little tin gods on wheels . "
letters not seldom they wrote him , " having the honour to state , " it would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf .
much would <unk> to his <unk> , an he consented to wait until the little tin gods built him a berth for himself , " special , well paid , and exempt from the law of the fifty and five , even to ninety and nine "  these were the terms of the <unk> : thus did the little tin gods ( long may their <unk> thrive ! )
silence his mouth with rupees , keeping their circle intact ; appointing a colonel from chatham who managed the <unk> state line ( the which was one mile and one furlong  a guaranteed <unk> gauge ) , so exeter <unk> <unk> consented his claims to resign , and died , on four thousand a month , in the <unk> year of his age !
<name> we have another viceroy now ,  those days are dead and done of <name> <unk> and depraved <name> <unk> .
<name> <unk> was a <name>  not too young  with a perfect taste in dresses and a <unk> tongue , with a thirst for information , and a greater thirst for praise , and a little house in simla in the prehistoric days .
by reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power , <name> was acquainted with the gossip of the hour ; and many little secrets , of the <unk> kind , were whispered to <name> , and she bore them all in mind .
she patronized extensively a man , <name> <unk> , whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one .
he wrote for certain papers , which , as everybody knows , is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows .
he praised her " queenly beauty " first ; and , later on , he hinted at the " vastness of her intellect " with compliment <unk> .
he went with her <unk> , and his love for her was such that he lent her all his horses and  she galled them very much .
one day , they brewed a secret of a fine financial sort ; it related to appointments , to a man and a report .
't was almost worth the keeping ,  only seven people knew it  and <unk> rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it .
it was a viceroy 's secret , but  perhaps the wine was red  perhaps an aged councillor had lost his aged head  perhaps <name> 's eyes were bright  <name> 's whispers sweet  the aged member told her what 'twere treason to repeat .
<name> went <unk> , and they talked of love and flowers ; <name> went <unk> , and he called for several hours ; <name> went <unk> , and <name> helped him dance  <name> let the waltzes go , and waited for his chance .
the summer sun was setting , and the summer air was still , the couple went <unk> in the shade of summer hill .
the wasteful sunset faded out in <unk> and gold , <name> pleaded softly , and  that bad <name> told !
next morn , a startled empire learnt the all-important news ; next week , the aged councillor was shaking in his shoes .
next month , i met <name> and she did not show the least hesitation in <unk> that <name> was a " beast . "
* * * * * we have another viceroy now , those days are dead and done  of <name> <unk> and most mean <name> <unk> !
what happened hurree chunder <unk> , pride of bow bazaar , owner of a native press , " <unk> , " waited on the government with a claim to wear sabres by the <unk> , rifles by the pair .
then the indian government winked a wicked wink , said to chunder <unk> : " stick to pen and ink .
they are safer implements , but , if you insist , we <name> let you <name> arms <unk> you list . "
hurree chunder <unk> sought the <unk> and bought the tubes of lancaster , <unk> , <name> , and bland , bought a shiny <unk> , bought a <unk> sword , jingled like a <unk> when he went abroad .
but the indian government , always keen to please , also gave permission to horrid men like these  yar mahommed <unk> , down to kill or steal , <unk> singh from <unk> , <unk> the bhil ; <unk> khan the <unk> chief , <unk> singh the sikh , <unk> baksh punjabi jat , <name> <unk> <unk>  he was a <unk> ; last , little boh <unk> took advantage of the act  took a snider too .
they were <unk> men , <unk> knew them not .
they procured their swords and guns chiefly on the spot ; and the <name> of centuries , plus a hundred fights , made them slow to disregard one another 's rights .
with a unanimity dear to patriot hearts all those hairy gentlemen out of foreign parts said : " the good old days are back  let us go to war ! "
swaggered down the grand trunk road into bow bazaar , <unk> baksh punjabi jat found a <unk> <unk> ; <unk> singh from <unk> oiled his <unk> <unk> ; yar mahommed <unk> spat and grinned with glee as he ground the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> singh the sikh procured sabre , <unk> , and <unk> , <name> <unk> , <unk> , jerked his dagger from its place , while amid the <unk> danced and grinned and <unk> little boh <unk> and cleared his <unk> from the scabbard .
what became of <unk> ?
<unk> , who can say ?
