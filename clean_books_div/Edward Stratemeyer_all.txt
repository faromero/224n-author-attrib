preface the life of <name> <name> is one well worth studying by any american boy who wishes to make something of himself and mount high on the ladder of success .
the <unk> president of our country is a fine type of the true american of to-day , full of <unk> and vigor , quick to comprehend , and equally quick to act , not afraid to defend his opinions against all comers when satisfied that he is in the right , independent , and yet not lacking in fine social qualities , physically and morally courageous , and with a <name> in himself and his god that is bound to make for good so long as he clings to it .
<name> <name> comes from countless generations of fighting stock , both in this country and abroad .
and yet as a youth the future hero of san <name> hill was a delicate lad , and many fears were entertained that he might not live to manhood .
but life in the open air , with judicious athletic exercise , accomplished wonders , and he became strong and hardy to an astonishing degree .
the boyhood days of the future president were spent in new york city and at the family 's country home , oyster bay , long island .
from there he went to harvard college , from which he graduated with high honors .
still somewhat delicate in health , he travelled in europe , studied for a short time at dresden , and took to climbing the alps and other noted mountains .
his mind had <unk> toward literature , and he was writing a naval history of the war of 1812 when something prompted him to take up politics , and almost before he knew it he was elected a new york state assemblyman .
he served in this capacity for three terms , and many are the stories told of how he fought against corruption first , last , and all the time .
the death of his first wife and of his beloved mother were at this time a great blow to him , and leaving his one little daughter with relatives , he struck out for the great west , where , in the bad lands , so called , he located as ranchman and <name> , filling in his spare hours by studying and by writing on various outdoor subjects , works which have become decidedly popular , and which show well his gifts as an author and as an observer of nature .
while still in great part a successful ranchman , he ran for mayor of new york and was defeated .
he now devoted himself with increased energy to his literary labors until , soon after , he was appointed by president <name> a member of the civil service commission .
he served on this commission with marked ability for six years , when he resigned to become police commissioner of new york city .
<name> <name> 's work as a police commissioner <name> not be readily forgotten .
the whole tone of the service was at once raised , and for the first time in many years the metropolis had " dry " sundays , when every saloon in the city was tightly closed .
this strict compliance with the law made him some enemies , but to these he paid no heed , for he was doing only his duty .
when <name> <name> was nominated for the presidency the first time , <name> <name> was one of his most enthusiastic supporters .
upon the election of <name> , <name> d. long was appointed secretary of the navy and <name> <name> became the first assistant secretary .
ever since writing his naval history the newly appointed assistant had made a close study of naval matters , and now he applied himself with vigor to the duties of his office ; and it was primarily through his efforts that when the war with spain came , our war-ships and our coast defences were in much better condition than they had been at any time previous in our history .
with the outbreak of the war , <name> <name> resigned .
" my duty here is done , " he said .
" my place is in the field . "
and without loss of time he and his intimate friend , dr. <name> wood , began the organization of that body of troops which was officially designated as the first united states volunteer cavalry , but which speedily became known everywhere as the rough riders ,  a body as unique as the world has ever seen , being made up of men from all over the union , but principally from four territories , and including hunters , cowboys , soldiers of fortune , <unk> and <unk> champions , college graduates , <unk> , with american , <name> , dutch , <name> , mexican , and indian blood in their veins ,  truly a remarkable collection , but every man and officer strong and hardy , full of courage , a good horseman , and a fine shot .
from the very start , the rough riders were anxious to get into the fight , and the opportunity was not long in coming .
from <name> the command was transported to <unk> , on the southern coast of cuba , and then began the advance upon the city of <name> , which brought on the engagement at la <unk> , followed by the thrilling battle of san <name> hill , in which the rough riders distinguished themselves in a manner that <name> never be forgotten .
in the very thickest of this fight was colonel <name> , urging his men forward to victory , regardless of the shot and shell falling upon all sides .
a hero truly , and such heroes are not forgotten .
upon the close of the war <name> <name> thought to retire to private life , but this was not to be .
arriving at new york , he was hailed with delight by thousands , and at the next election was made governor of the empire state .
as governor he made friends in both of the leading political parties by his <unk> and his <name> honesty .
men might differ with him politically , but they could never accuse him of doing that which he himself did not firmly believe was right .
his term as governor had not yet expired when president <name> was nominated for a second term .
again the people at large <unk> for <name> , and against his <name> protestations he was forced to accept the nomination for the <unk> .
he was elected , and at the proper time took his seat as presiding officer of the senate .
it was at this time a blow fell upon our nation from which we have scarcely yet recovered .
president <name> was struck down by the cowardly hand of an assassin .
the vice-president was at this time off on one of his favorite outings , but with all possible speed he came back and was sworn in as president .
it was a great responsibility , and many feared that great changes in our government might result .
but the fears proved groundless .
young as he was ,  and he is the youngest of all of our presidents ,  he took upon himself the duty of carrying out the intentions of his predecessor , and proving to the world once again that , even though a president die , " the government at washington still lives . "
there is another side to the character of our president which must not be overlooked .
he is of strong religious convictions and a member of the dutch reformed church .
it is seldom that he is given to preaching , but when he does his words have a sincerity that proves much for the foundation of his character .
he stands for what is honest and upright in political and private life , and although , being but human , he may make mistakes , he remains a chief magistrate well deserving the highest honors our nation can bestow .

the twentieth century looms before us big with the fate of many nations .
if we stand idly by , if we seek merely swollen , <unk> ease and ignoble peace , if we shrink from the hard contests where men must win at hazard of their lives and at the risk of all they hold dear , then the bolder and stronger peoples <name> pass us by and <name> win for themselves the domination of the world .
let us therefore boldly face the life of strife , resolute to do our duty well and manfully ; resolute to uphold righteousness by deed and by word ; resolute to be both honest and brave , to serve high ideals , yet to use practical methods .
above all , let us not shrink from strife , moral or physical , within or without the nation , provided that we are certain that the strife is justified ; for it is only through strife , through hard and dangerous endeavor , that we shall ultimately win the goal of true national greatness . "
these words , taken from president <name> 's remarkable speech on " the strenuous life , " show well the character of the man , his lofty ideals , his <name> courage , his absolute honesty , and <unk> patriotism .
he is a typical american in the best sense of the word , and his life is worthy of careful study .
from it american boys of to-day , and in generations to come , may gain lessons that <name> do them much good .
<name> <name> , the <unk> president of our country , was born in new york city , october 27 , 1858 .
the place of his birth was the old family mansion at 28 east twentieth street , in a neighborhood which , at that time , was the abode of wealth and culture .
the building is one of a row , of a type to be seen in hundreds of other places , of brick and stone , four stories and a basement high , the upper floor being an attic .
a heavy railing runs from in front of the basement up the broad front steps to the doorway .
inside , the rooms are large and comfortably arranged , and there was , in those days , quite a nice garden in the rear .
[ illustration : <name> <name> 's birthplace .
28 e. 20th street , new york city . ]
it can truthfully be said that <name> <name> comes from a race of soldiers and statesmen , and that dutch , scotch , french , and <name> blood flows in his veins .
this being so , it is no wonder that , when the <unk> war broke out , he closed his desk as assistant secretary of the navy , saying , " my duty here is done ; my place is in the field , " and went forth to win <name> on the battle-field of san <name> hill .
five generations of <unk> lived in or near new york previous to the birth of <name> <name> , the father of the president , in 1831 .
nearly all were well-to-do , and many served the city and the state as aldermen and members of the legislature .
during the revolution they followed under washington 's banner , and their purses were wide open to further the cause of independence .
<name> <name> the elder was a merchant and banker ; a man broad in his views and filled with the spirit of genuine philanthropy .
he founded one of the hospitals of the city and was at one time chairman of the state board of charities .
a story is told of him which is probably true .
one day <name> loring brace came to him for financial assistance in establishing homes for the little <unk> of the city .
" i <name> see what i can do , " said mr. <name> .
" but you know that just at present i am busy with other charitable works . "
" i know that , " said mr. brace .
" but what i ask for is very much needed .
the <unk> and poor , homeless newsboys have no shelter . "
the next day , when returning from the establishment in which he was a partner , mr. <name> came upon a newsboy sitting on a doorstep , crying bitterly .
" what is the matter , my little man ? "
he asked .
" i lost me money ; it dropped down into de sewer hole ! "
sobbed the ragged urchin .
" every cent of it is gone . "
mr. <name> questioned the lad and found out that the boy had no home and that his only relative was a <unk> who was hardly ever sober .
he gave the lad some money to replace the amount lost , and the next day sent word to mr. brace that he would do all he possibly could toward establishing the <unk> ' shelters that were so much needed .
the <unk> lodging house of new york city is one of the results of mr. <unk> practical charities .
he also did much to give criminals a helping hand when they came from prison , stating that that was the one time in their lives when they most needed help , for fear they might slip back into their previous bad habits .
in 1853 <name> <name> the elder married miss <name> bullock , of <unk> , <unk> county , <name> .
miss bullock was the daughter of <name> <name> s. bullock and a direct descendant of <unk> bullock , the first governor of <name> .
it <name> thus be seen that the future president had both northern and southern blood in his make-up , and it may be added here that during the terrible civil war his relatives were to be found both in the union and the confederate ranks .
mrs. <name> was a strong southern <unk> , and when a certain gathering , during the civil war , was in progress at the <name> city home , she insisted upon displaying a confederate flag at one of the windows .
" i am afraid it <name> make trouble , " said mr. <name> ; and he was right .
soon a mob began to gather in the street , clamoring that the flag be taken down .
" i shall not take it down , " said mrs. <name> , bravely .
" the room is mine , and the flag is mine .
i love it , and nobody shall touch it .
explain to the crowd that i am a southern woman and that i love my country . "
there being no help for it , mr. <name> went to the front door and explained matters as best he could .
a few in the crowd grumbled , but when mrs. <name> came to the window and looked down on the gathering , one after another the men went away , and she and her flag remained unmolested .
<name> <name> , the future president , was one of a family of four .
he had a brother <name> and two sisters .
his brother was several years younger than himself , but much more robust , and would probably have lived many years and have distinguished himself , had he not met death in a railroad accident while still a young man .
in the years when <name> <name> was a boy , new york city was not what it is to-day .
the neighborhood in which he lived was , as i have already mentioned , a fashionable one , and the same may be said of many other spots near to union square , where tall business blocks were yet unknown .
the boys and girls loved to play in the little park and on the avenue , and here it was that the rather delicate schoolboy grew to know <name> <unk> , who lived in fourteenth street and who was his school companion .
little did they dream in those days , as they played together , that one day he would be president and she his loving wife , the mistress of the white house .
mr. <name> was a firm believer in public institutions , and he did not hesitate to send his children to the public schools , especially his boys , that they might come in direct personal contact with the great outside world .
so to a near-by institution of learning <name> and <name> trudged day after day , with their <unk> under their arms , just as thousands of other schoolboys are doing to-day .
but in those days there were few experiments being tried in the schools , and <name> training and the like were unknown .
the boys were well grounded in reading , writing , and arithmetic , as well as spelling , history , and geography , and there was great excitement when a " <unk> " was in progress , to see who could spell the rest of the class or the gathering down .
it is said upon good authority that <name> <name> was a model scholar from the start .
he loved to read cooper 's " <unk> tales , " and works of travel , and preferred books above anything else .
but when he found that constant studying was ruining his constitution , he determined to build himself up physically as well as mentally .
in the summer time the family often went to the old <name> " out of town " mansion on long island .
this was called " tranquillity , " a fine large place near oyster bay , set in a grove of beautiful trees .
the journey to " tranquillity " was in those days a tedious one , but the <name> children did not mind it , and once at the old place they were certain of a good time so long as their vacation lasted .
here it was that <name> <name> learned to ride on horseback and how to handle a gun .
and here , too , the boys would go boating , fishing , and bathing , to their hearts ' content .
mr. <name> <name> the elder was a member of the dutch reformed church , and the religious teaching of his children was not neglected .
at an early age the future president became a member of that denomination and has remained a member ever since .
the church was on the east side , and had <unk> pews , and here were delivered sermons that were as long as they were full of strength and wisdom .
that these sermons had their full effect upon the future president is shown by his addresses delivered before the young men 's <name> association of new york city and a church community of the west , years later .
in addressing the young men 's <name> association mr. <name> , who was then governor of the state , said :  " the vice of envy is not only dangerous , but also a mean vice , for it is always a confession of inferiority .
it may provoke conduct which <name> be fruitful of wrong to others ; and it must cause misery to the man who feels it .
it <name> not be any the less fruitful of wrong and misery if , as is often the case with evil motives , it adopts some <unk> alias .
the truth is , gentlemen , that each one of us has in him certain passions and instincts which , if they gain the upper hand in his soul , would mean that the wild beast had come uppermost in him .
envy , malice , and hatred are such passions , and they are just as bad if directed against a class or group of men as if directed against an individual . "
golden words , well worth remembering .
a person who believes in them with all his heart can not go far wrong in his actions , no matter what his station in life .
chapter ii <unk> <name>  goes to harvard college  member of many clubs  death of mr. <name>  anecdotes of college life the instincts of the <name> must have been born in <name> <name> .
his first gun was given to him when he was ten years of age , and for the time being his books and his studies were forgotten , and he devoted his whole time and attention to shooting at a target set up in the garden of the country home and in going out with the older folks after such small game as were to be found in that vicinity .
the horses on the place were his pets , and he knew the peculiarities of each as well as did the man who cared for them .
riding and driving came to him as naturally as breathing , and the fact that a steed was <unk> did not <unk> him .
" my father often drove <unk> , " he has said .
" i liked very much to go with him , and i liked to drive , too . "
<name> <name> 's schoolboy days were not far out of the ordinary .
he studied hard , and if he failed in a lesson he did his best to make it up the next time .
it is well said that there is no <name> road to learning , and even a future president must study just as hard as his classmates if he wants to keep up with them .
sometimes he was absent from school on account of sickness , and then it was a sharp struggle to keep from dropping behind .
" in those days nobody expected <name> <name> to amount to a great deal , " some one has said .
" he was thin , pale , and delicate , and suffered with his eyes .
but he pulled through , and when he took to athletics , it was wonderful how he got stronger . "
by his intimate companions , and indeed by nearly everybody who knew him , he was called <name> , and this nickname clung to him when he went forth into the great world to become a governor and a president .
how the nickname came first into use is not known .
since those schoolboy days mr. <name> has been asked this question :  " what did you expect to be , or dream of being , when you were a boy ? "
" i do not recollect that i dreamed at all or planned at all , " was the answer .
" i simply obeyed the injunction , <unk> thy hand <unk> to do , do that with all thy might , ' and so i took up what came along as it came . "
in 1876 , while the great centennial exhibition was being held at philadelphia in commemoration of one hundred years of national <name> , <name> <name> took up his residence at cambridge , massachusetts , and became a student at harvard college .
during the previous year his health had been poor indeed , but now he had taken hold of himself in <name> .
" i determined to be strong and well , and did everything to make myself so , " he has said .
" by the time i entered harvard i was able to take part in whatever sports i liked . "
as perhaps some of my readers know , harvard college ( now termed a university ) is the oldest and largest institution of learning in the united states .
it was founded in <unk> , and among its graduates numbered <name> <name> adams , sixth president of our country .
the college proper is located in cambridge , but some of the attached schools are in boston .
<name> <name> was <name> enough to have lived in elegant style while at harvard , but he preferred unostentatious quarters , and took two rooms in the home of <unk> .
h. richardson , at what was then no .
16 and is now no .
88 winthrop street .
the residence is a neat and comfortable one , standing on the southwest corner of winthrop and <unk> streets .
the young student had two rooms on the second floor ,  one of good size , used for a study , and a small bedroom .
in the whole four years he was at the college he occupied these rooms , and he spent a great deal of time in fixing them up to suit his own peculiar taste .
on the walls were all sorts of pictures and photographs , along with <unk> and <unk> , and the horns of wild animals .
on a shelf rested some birds which he had himself stuffed , and books were everywhere .
[ illustration : house in which <name> <name> <unk> while at harvard . ]
" it was a regular den , and typical of <name> to the last degree , " a student of those times has said .
" he had his gun there and his fishing <name> , and often spoke of using them .
he was noted for trying to get at the bottom of things , and i remember him well on one occasion when i found him with a stuffed bird in one hand and a natural history in the other , trying to decide if the description in the volume covered the specimen before him . "
when <name> graduated from college , he was one of a very few that took honors , and the subject of his essay was natural history .
how his love of natural history continued <name> be shown later when we see him as a ranchman and <name> of the west .
<name> <name> had decided to make the most of himself , and while at harvard scarcely a moment was wasted .
if he was not studying , he was in the gymnasium or on the field , doing what he could to make himself strong .
he was a firm believer in the saying that a sound body makes a sound mind , and he speedily became a good boxer , <unk> , <unk> , and runner .
he wrestled a great deal , and of this sport says :  " i enjoyed it immensely and never injured myself .
i think i was a good deal of a <unk> , and though i never won a championship , yet more than once i won my trial heats and got into the final rounds . "
at running he was equally good .
" i remember once we had a stiff run out into the country , " said a <unk> .
" <name> was behind at the start , but when all of the others got played out he forged ahead , and in the end he beat us by several minutes .
but he never <unk> about it .
you see , it was n't his style . "
with all his other sports , and his studying , the young <unk> did not give up his love for driving .
he had a good horse and a fancy cart ,  one of the elevated sort with large wheels ,  and in this turnout he was seen many a day , driving wherever it pleased him to go .
sometimes he would get on the road with other students , and then there was bound to be more or less racing .
with a strong love for natural history it was not surprising that he joined the natural history club of the college , and of this he was one of the most active members .
he also joined the athletic association , of which he was a steward , and the <name> club , the rifle corps , the <unk> .
society , and the finance club .
in his senior year he became a member of the <unk> club , the hasty pudding , and the <name> <name> <unk> club , and also one of the editors of a college paper called the advocate .
on sundays he taught a class of boys , first in a mission school , and then in a <unk> <name> school .
it was a life full of planning , full of study , and full of work , and it suited <name> <name> to the last degree .
as he grew older his love of natural history was supplemented by a love for the history of nations , and particularly by a love of the history of his own country .
the war of 1812 interested him intensely , and before he graduated he laid plans for writing a history of this war , which should go into all the details of the memorable naval conflicts .
it was while in his third year at harvard that <name> <name> suffered the first heavy affliction of his life .
on february 9 , 1878 , his father died .
it was a cruel blow to the family , and one from which the faithful wife scarcely recovered .
the son at harvard felt his loss greatly , and it was some time before he felt able to resume his studies .
the elder <name> 's work as a <unk> was well known , and many gathered at his bier to do him honor , while the public journals were filled with <unk> of the man .
the poor mourned bitterly that he was gone , and even the newsboys were filled with regret over his taking away .
in speaking of his parent , president <name> once said : " i can remember seeing him going down broadway , staid and respectable business man that he was , with a poor sick kitten in his coat pocket , which he had picked up in the street . "
such a man could not but have a heart overflowing with goodness .
while at college <name> <name> often showed that self-reliance for which he has since become famous .
to every study that he took up he applied himself closely , and if he was not at the head of the class , he was by no means near the foot .
when he was sure of a thing , no amount of argument could convince him that he was wrong , and he did not hesitate at times to enter into a discussion even with some of the professors over him .
although a close student , and also a good <unk> athlete , <name> <name> did not forget his social opportunities .
boston was but a short distance from his rooms in cambridge , and thither he often went to visit the people he had met or to whom he had letters of introduction .
he was always welcome , for his manner was a winning one , and he usually had something to tell that was of interest  something of what he had seen or done , of the next <unk> or <unk> game , of the coming boat races , of his driving or exploring , or of how he had added a new stuffed bird to his collection , or a new lizard , and of how a far-away friend had sent him a big turtle as a souvenir of an ocean trip in the south seas .
there is a story that this big turtle got loose one night and alarmed the entire household by crawling through the hallway , looking for a pond or <unk> in which to wallow .
at first the turtle was mistaken for a burglar , but he soon revealed himself by his angry snapping , and it was hard work making him a prisoner once more .
chapter iii marries miss <name> <name>  travels in europe  bold <unk>  studying law in new york  elected to the assembly  personal encounter with the enemy it was a proud and happy day for <name> <name> when , in the summer of 1880 , he was graduated from harvard .
he took scholarly as well as social honors , and came forth a <unk> beta <unk> man .
his <unk> wished him well , and his family greeted him most affectionately .
yet with it all there was just a bit of melancholy in this breaking away from a place that had been as a second home to him for four long years .
the students were scattering to the four points of the compass , and he might never see some of them again .
but others were there whom he was to meet later , and who were destined to march under him up the <unk> slopes of san <name> in far-away cuba .
but at that time there was no thought of war and carnage , only good-fellowship , with addresses and orations , music , flying flags , and huge bonfires and fireworks at night .
happy college days were they , never to be forgotten .
[ illustration : <name> <name> at graduation , 1880 . ]
while a student at harvard , <name> <name> had become intimately acquainted with miss <name> <name> , of boston , a beautiful girl who was a member of an aristocratic family of that city .
the young college student was a frequent visitor at the home of the <unk> , and on <name> 23 , 1880 , the two were married .
it had been decided that <name> <name> should travel in europe after <unk> .
his father had left the family well provided for , so there was no rush to get into something whereby a living might be earned .
yet <name> <name> had long since determined not to be an <unk> .
he would travel and improve his mind , and then settle down to that for which he seemed best fitted .
to europe then he went , accompanied by his bride , to study a little and to visit the <name> galleries and museums , the palaces of kings and queens , and the many great cities of that continent .
he travelled through italy , switzerland , germany , <name> , and the british isles , taking note of everything he saw and comparing it with what he had seen in his own country .
when in lower europe , the spirit of adventure seized him , and he climbed those lofty mountains of the alps , the jungfrau and the matterhorn , and for those deeds of daring was made a member of the alpine club of london .
it may be mentioned here that climbing the mountains mentioned is a very difficult feat , and that more than one traveller has lost his life in such attempts .
the peaks are covered with snow and ice ; the path from one <name> to the next is narrow and uncertain , and a fall into some dark and fearful hollow usually means death .
but the danger only urged <name> <name> on , and added zest to the undertaking .
he was intensely interested in all he saw , both in europe proper and in the british isles , but wrote that he was glad to get back home again , among his own people .
to him there was no country like <name> , the land of golden opportunity , as one of our most noted writers has called it .
in europe there was more or less a lack of personal <name> ; here a man could try to make what he pleased of himself , be it cobbler or president .
the young college graduate had an uncle in new york , named <name> b. <name> , who was a well-known lawyer .
on his return to this country <name> <name> entered his uncle 's office , and likewise took up the study of law at columbia university , attending the lectures given by professor <name> .
here again his search after what he termed " bottom facts " came to light , and he is well remembered as a member of the law class because of the way he frequently asked questions and called for explanations  accepting nothing as a fact until it was perfectly clear in his own mind .
the interruptions did not always suit the professor or the other students , yet they were often the means of clearing up a point that was hazy to many others who had not the courage to thrust forth their inquiries as did <name> <name> .
" he wants to know it all , " said one student , in disgust .
" well , never mind ; i wish i knew it all , " answered another .
" i guess he knows what he is doing . "
and in this he was right ; <name> <name> knew exactly what he was trying to accomplish .
the young man was now twenty-three years of age , broad-shouldered , and in much better health than ever before .
he had not abandoned his athletic training , and would often run out to the old home at oyster bay for a tramp into the woods or on a hunting tour .
while still studying law , <name> <name> entered politics by taking an active part in a republican primary .
he lived in the twenty-third assembly district of the state .
the district included a great number of <name> and influential citizens , and on that account was called the " <name> back district . "
" let us put up young <name> for assembly , " said one of the politicians .
" he 's a clever fellow . "
" that may be , " said another .
" but i do n't know that we can manage him .
he seems a fellow who wants his own way . "
" yes , he 'll want his own way , but i reckon that way <name> be the right way , " put in a third speaker .
no sooner had <name> <name> 's name been mentioned as a possible candidate than there was a storm of opposition from some politicians who had in the past ruled the district with a <name> of iron .
it was a republican district , so that the contest for the place was entirely in the primary .
" if he is nominated and elected , our power <name> be gone , " they told themselves ; and set to work without delay to throw the nomination into the hands of somebody else .
<name> <name> suspected what was going on , but he said nothing to those who opposed him .
with his friends he was very <name> , and told them that if he was nominated he would do his best to win the election and serve them honestly in the legislature .
his <unk> won him many friends , and when the primary was held , those who had opposed him were chagrined to see him win the nomination with votes to spare .
some at once predicted that he would not be elected .
" those who opposed him at the primary <name> not vote for him , " they said .
" they would rather help the democrats . "
but this prediction proved false .
at the election <name> <name> was elected with a good majority .
it was his first battle in the political arena and if he felt proud over it , who can blame him ?
the state capitol of new york is , as my young readers must know , at albany , on the upper hudson , and hither the young assemblyman journeyed .
the <unk> poured in from all over the state , and were made up of all sorts and conditions of men , including bankers , farmers , merchants , contractors , liquor dealers , and even <unk> .
many of these men were thoroughly honest , but there were others who were there for gain only , and who cared little for the passing of just laws .
the party to which <name> <name> belonged was in the minority , so that the young assemblyman found he would have to struggle hard if he expected to be heard at all .
but the thoughts of such a struggle only put him on his mettle , and he plunged in with a vigor that astonished his opponents and caused great delight to his friends .
" he is fearless , " said one who had voted for him .
" he <name> make things warm for those who do n't want to act on the square . "
and he certainly did make it warm , until a certain class grew to fear and hate him to such a degree that they plotted to do him bodily harm .
" he has got to learn that he must mind his own business , " was the way one of these <unk> reasoned .
" but what can we do ? "
asked another .
" he 's as sharp on the floor of the assembly as a steel trap . "
" we 'll get stubby to brush up against him , " said a third .
stubby was a bar-room loafer who had been at one time something of a <unk> .
he was a thoroughly unprincipled fellow , and it was known that he would do almost anything for money .
" sure , i 'll fix him , " said stubby .
" you just leave him to me and see how i polish him off . "
the <unk> and their tool met at the <unk> house , an old-fashioned hotel at which politicians in and around the capital were wont to congregate , and waited for the young assemblyman .
<name> was not long in putting in an appearance and was soon in deep discussion with some friends .
" watch him , stubby , " said one of the young assemblyman 's enemies .
" don't let him get away from you to-night . "
" i have me eye on him , " answered stubby .
<name> was on the way to the buffet of the hotel when the crowd , with stubby in front , pushed against him rudely .
the young assemblyman stepped back and viewed those before him fearlessly .
" say , what do <name> mean , running into me that way ? "
demanded stubby , insolently .
as he spoke he aimed a savage blow at <name> <name> .
but the young assemblyman had not forgotten how to box , and he dodged with an agility that was astonishing .
" this fellow needs to be taught a lesson , " <name> <name> told himself , and then and there he proceeded to administer the lesson in a manner that stubby never forgot .
he went down flat on his back , and when he got up , he went down again , with a bleeding nose and one eye all but closed .
seeing this , several leaped in to his assistance , but it was an ill-fated move , for <name> turned on them also , and down they went , too ; and then the encounter came to an end , with <name> <name> the <name> .
" and that was n't the end of it , " said one , who witnessed the affair .
" after it was over young <name> was as smiling as ever .
he walked straight over to some of his enemies who had been watching the mix-up from a distance and told them very plainly that he knew how the attack had originated , and he was much obliged to them , for he had n't enjoyed himself so much for a year .
phew !
but were n't those fellows mad !
and was n't stubby mad when he learned that they had set him against one of the best <unk> harvard ever turned out ?
but after that you can make sure they treated <name> with respect and gave him a wide berth . "
chapter iv <name> <name> and governor <name>  good work as an assemblyman  some measures pushed through  birth of <name> <name>  death of mr. <name> 's mother the career of an assemblyman is not generally an interesting one , but mr. <name> managed to extract not a little pleasure and also some profit from it .
the experience was just what he needed to fit himself for the larger positions he was , later on , to occupy .
one happening is of peculiar interest to note .
while <name> <name> was a member of the assembly , <name> <name> became governor of the state .
mr. <name> was a democrat , while mr. <name> was a republican , yet the two future presidents of the united states became warm friends ,  a friendship that has endured to the present day .
it is said that the friendship started in rather a peculiar manner .
there was at the time a measure before the assembly to reduce the fare of the elevated roads in new york city from ten cents to five cents .
after a great deal of talking , the <name> passed the assembly and then the senate , and went to the governor for his signature .
much to the surprise of the general public governor <name> <unk> the <name> , stating that when the capitalists had built the elevated roads they had understood that the fare was to be ten cents , and that it was not right to deprive them of their profits .
at once those who wanted the measure to become a law decided to pass it over the governor 's head .
when this attempt was made , <name> <name> got up boldly and said he could not again vote for the <name>  that he was satisfied that governor <name> 's view of the matter was correct .
" these people would not have put their money in the elevated railroads had they not been assured that the fare was to be ten cents , " said he .
" we are under obligation to them , and we must keep our promises . "
and so the <name> fell through .
it was not in itself right that the fare should be ten cents , and it has long since been reduced to five cents , but it shows that <name> <name> was bound to do what was right and just , according to the dictates of his own conscience , and this won for him many friends , even among those who had opposed him politically .
in a work of this kind , intended mainly for the use of young people , it is not necessary to do more than glance at the work which <name> <name> accomplished while a member of the new york assembly .
he made a close study of the various political offices of new york county and discovered that many <unk> were drawing large sums of money in the shape of fees for which they were doing hardly any work .
this he considered unfair , and by dint of hard labor helped to pass a law placing such offices on the salary list , making a saving to the county of probably half a million dollars a year .
one of the best things done by <name> <name> at that time was the support given by him to a civil service law for the state .
up to that time <unk> was largely in the hands of the party which happened to be in power .
" this is all wrong , " said the young assemblyman .
" a clerk or anybody else doing his duty faithfully should not be thrown out as soon as there is a political change . "
the new law was passed , and this was the beginning of what is commonly called the merit system , whereby a large number of those who work for the state are judged solely by their <unk> and not by their political beliefs .
this system has since been extended to other states and also to <unk> under the national government .
another important measure pushed through the assembly by <name> <name> was what was known as the <unk> charter for new york city , giving to the mayor certain rights which in the past had rested in the board of aldermen .
this measure was defeated during <name> 's second term of office , but in 1884 he pressed it with such force that it overcame all opposition and became a law .
many have considered this victory his very best work .
by those who knew him at this time he is described as having almost a boyish figure , <name> face , clear , penetrating eyes , and a smile of good-natured friendship and dry humor .
when he talked it was with an earnestness that could not be mistaken .
by those who were especially bitter against him he was sometimes called a dude and a silk stocking , but to these insinuations he paid no attention , and after the encounter at the <unk> house his opponents were decidedly more careful as to how they addressed him .
" take him all the way through he was generally even tempered , " one has said who met him at that time .
" but occasionally there was a flash from his eye that made his opponent draw back in quick order .
he would stand a good deal , but there were some things he would n't take , and they knew it .
one thing is certain , after he was in the assembly for a few months everybody knew perfectly that to come to him with any <name> that was the least bit shady was a waste of time and effort .
<name> would n't stand for it a minute . "
in those days <name> <name> did not give up his habits of athletic exercise , and nearly every day he could be seen taking long walks in the country around albany .
in the meantime his " naval war of 1812 " was well under way , but he could spare only a few hours occasionally to complete his manuscript .
his married life had thus far been a happy one , and its <name> was greatly increased by the birth of his daughter <name> .
as <name> be seen later , mr. <name> is what is called a family man , and he took great comfort in this new addition to his little household .
but his happiness was short-lived , for in 1884 , when the daughter was but a baby , the beloved wife died , and the little one had to be given over to the care of the grandparents in boston .
not many months later mr. <name> 's mother died also , heaping additional sorrow upon his head .
with the conclusion of his third term in the assembly <name> <name> 's work as a member of that body came to an end .
if he had made some enemies , he had made more friends , and he was known as an ardent supporter of reform in all branches of politics .
in recognition of his ability he was chosen as a <unk> to the republican convention brought together to nominate a candidate to succeed president <name> .
at that time <name> g. <name> from maine had served many years in the united states senate , and it was thought that he would surely be both nominated and elected .
but many were opposed to <name> , thinking he would not support such reform measures as they wished to see advanced , and among this number was <name> <name> .
" we must nominate mr. <unk> , " said the young <unk> , and did his best for the gentleman in question .
" it can not be done , " said another delegate .
the convention met at exposition hall in chicago , and mr. <name> was placed on the committee on resolutions .
it was a <name> convention , and ballot after ballot had to be taken before a nomination could be secured .
<name> led from the start , with senator <unk> a fairly close second .
" if <name> is nominated , he <name> be defeated , " said more than one .
at last came the deciding vote , and <name> g. <name> was put up at the head of the ticket , with <name> a. <name> for vice-president .
at once <name> clubs were organized all over the country , and the republican party did all in its power to elect its candidate .
he was called the plumed knight , and many political clubs wore plumes in his honor when on parade .
in the meantime the democrats had nominated <name> <name> .
the fight was exceedingly bitter up to the very evening of election day .
when the votes were counted , it was found that <name> had been defeated by a large majority , and that <name> <name> , <name> 's old friend , had won the highest gift in the hands of the nation .
his work at the convention in chicago was <name> <name> 's first entrance into national affairs , and his speeches on that occasion <name> not be readily forgotten .
it was here that he came into contact with <name> <name> , with whom , sixteen years later , he was to run on the same ticket .
the records of that convention show that on one occasion <name> spoke directly after <name> .
thus were these two drawn together at that early day without knowing or dreaming that one was to succeed the other to the presidency .
but though <name> <name> was disappointed over the nomination made at chicago , he did not desert his party .
instead he did all he could to lead them to victory , until the death of his mother caused him to withdraw temporarily from public affairs .
[ illustration : signature : <name> <name> <name> ] chapter v <name> <name> as a ranchman and <name> in the bad lands  bringing down his first buffalo  rattlesnakes , and a wild goose <name> <name> had now published his " naval history of the war of 1812 , " and it had created a decidedly favorable opinion among those critics who were best able to judge of the production .
it is an authoritative work , and is to-day in the library of nearly every american war-ship afloat , as well as in numerous government libraries in this country , as at washington , west point , and annapolis , and also in leading libraries of england .
being out of politics the young author thought of taking up his pen once more .
but he was restless by nature , and the loss of his wife and his mother still weighed heavily upon him .
so he took himself to the west , to where the little missouri river flows in winding form through what are called the bad lands of north <name> .
here , on the edge of the cattle country , <name> <name> had become possessed of two ranches , one called the <unk> and the other chimney butte .
both were located by the river , which during the dry season was hardly of any depth at all , but which during the heavy rains , or during the spring <unk> , became a roaring torrent .
at one of these ranches <name> <name> settled down for the time being , to rough it in hunting and raising cattle .
when the weather would not permit of his going abroad , or when the mood of the author seized him , he wrote .
as a result of these experiences he has given us a delightful work called " the hunting trips of a ranchman , " first published in 1885 , giving his adventures among the cattle and while on the hunt , sometimes alone and sometimes in company with the rude but honest cow <unk> and <unk> who surrounded him .
mr. <name> has described the ranch at which he lived for the greater part of his time as a long , low , <unk> house of hewn logs , clean and neat , and with many rooms .
it faced the river , and in front was a long , low veranda , where one might idle on a clear , warm day to his heart 's content .
inside , the main room contained a shelf full of the owner 's favorite outdoor books and the walls half-a-dozen pet pictures .
rifles and <unk> stood handy in corners , and on pegs and deer horns <name> overcoats of wolf or coon skin and gloves of otter or beaver .
that <name> <name> was a close observer of all that occurred around him is proved by his writings .
with great minuteness he has described his life at the ranch home and while in the saddle , both in <name> and summer , telling of his experiences while rounding up cattle and while bringing down <unk> and larger game of various kinds .
he likewise describes the trained hunters he has met at different seasons of the year , and tells of what they have done or were trying to do .
at this time his favorite horse was a steed called <unk> .
but when on a round-up of cattle , many ponies were taken along , so that a fresh mount could be had at any time .
it was a breezy , free life , and to it our president undoubtedly owes the rugged constitution that he possesses to-day .
his observations led him to make many investigations concerning the smaller wild animals near his ranches and the larger beasts to be found farther off .
the tales which were told to him by other ranchmen and hunters he always took " with a grain of salt , " and he soon reached the conclusion that many of the <unk> mighty hunters were only such in name , and had brought down quantities of game only in years gone by when such game was plentiful and could be laid low without much trouble .
once when a man told him he had brought down a certain beast at four hundred yards , <name> measured the distance and found it to be less than half that .
" you could n't fool him on much , " said one of the persons who met him about that time .
" he would take precious little for granted .
he wanted to know the how of everything , and he was n't satisfied until he did know . "
regarding his own powers as a <name> at that time , mr. <name> is very modest .
he says his eyesight was rather poor , and his hand not over steady , so that " drawing a bead " on anything was not easy .
yet he went into the sport with much enthusiasm , and if at times he came back at nightfall empty-handed , he did not complain , and he was almost certain to have something interesting to tell of what he had seen .
<name> <name> had been in this territory before , although not to remain any great length of time .
once he had come out to hunt buffalo , no easy thing to do , since this game was growing <unk> every day .
he had a guide named ferris , who was not particularly struck with the appearance of the pale young man , plainly dressed , whom he met at the railroad station .
" i sized him up as not being able to endure a long trip after a buffalo , " said the guide , in speaking afterward of the meeting .
" he was well mounted , but he looked as if he might play out before the sun went down . "
but in this the guide was mistaken .
<name> proved that he could ride as well as anybody .
the first night out found the hunters about thirty miles from any settlement .
they went into camp on the open prairie , <unk> their horses with ropes fastened to their saddles , which they used as pillows .
all went well for an hour or two , when the improvised pillow was jerked from beneath <name> <name> 's head , and he heard his horse bounding away in the distance .
" wolves ! "
cried the guide .
" they have frightened our horses ! "
so it proved ; and the hunters lost no time in reaching for their firearms .
but the wolves kept their distance , and soon <name> <name> was running after the horses , which , after a good deal of trouble , he secured and brought back .
after that the guide no longer looked on him as a " <unk> . "
" a <unk> , " said he , " would have been scared to death .
but <name> <name> was as cool as a cucumber through it all  as if the happening was n't in the least out of the ordinary . "
for several days the hunters remained on the prairie looking for buffalo , but without success .
they were on the point of turning back when the guide noticed that the horses were growing uneasy .
" some big game at hand , " he announced .
" come on to yonder <unk> and see if i am not right . "
with great caution the hunters advanced to the <unk> the guide had mentioned .
dismounting , they crept forward in the shelter of the brushwood , and there , true enough , resting at his ease was a great buffalo bull .
" hit him where the patch of red shows on his side , " whispered the guide , and <name> nodded to show that he understood .
with care and coolness he took aim and fired , and the buffalo bull leaped up and staggered forward with the blood streaming from his mouth and nose .
" shall i give him another ? "
was the question asked , but before it could be answered the buffalo bull gave a plunge and fell dead .
rattlesnakes are rather unpleasant reptiles to deal with , and <name> <name> has shown his bravery by the way in which he speaks of them in his accounts of outdoor life .
he says to a man wearing alligator boots there is little danger , for the <unk> of the reptile can not go through the leather , and the snake rarely strikes as high as one 's knee .
but he had at least one experience with a rattlesnake not readily forgotten .
he was out on a hunt for antelope .
the sage-brush in which he was concealing himself was so low that he had to crawl along flat on his breast , pushing himself forward with hands and feet as best he could .
he was almost on the antelope when he heard a warning whirr close at his side , and glancing hastily in that direction , saw the reptile but a few feet away , coiled up and ready to attack .
it was a thrilling and critical moment , and had the young <name> leaped up he might have been dangerously if not fatally struck .
but by instinct he backed away silently and moved off in another direction through the brush .
the rattlesnake did not follow , although it kept its piercing eyes on the <name> as long as possible .
after the antelope stalk was over , <name> came back to the spot , made a careful search , and , watching his chance , fired on the rattlesnake , killing it instantly .
in those days <name> <name> met colonel <name> <name> , commonly known as " buffalo <name> , " and many other celebrated characters of the west .
he never grew tired of listening to the stories these old trappers , hunters , scouts , and <unk> had to tell , and some of these stories he afterward put into print , and they have made excellent reading .
during many of his hunting expeditions at that time <name> <name> was accompanied by his foreman , a good shot and <unk> ranchman named <unk> .
<unk> had been in the west but five years , but the life fitted him exactly , and in him <name> the ranchman and <name> found a companion exactly to his liking , fearless and <unk> to the last degree .
as perhaps most of my young readers know , wild geese are generally brought down with a shot-gun , but in the bad lands it was not unusual to bring them down with a rifle , provided the <name> was quick and accurate enough in his aim .
one morning , just before <name> , <name> <name> was riding along the edge of a creek when he heard a <unk> that he knew must come from some geese , and he determined if possible to lay one low .
it was easy work to dismount and crawl to the edge of the creek .
but a fog lay over the water , and he could see the geese but indistinctly .
leaving the creek bank , he ran silently to where the watercourse made a turn and then crawled forward in the brush .
soon the fog lifted once more , and he saw the geese resting on the water close to the bend .
he fired quickly and brought down the largest of the flock , while the others lost no time in disappearing .
it was a good fat goose and made excellent eating .
chapter <name> grouse and other small game  the scotchman and the skunk  caught in a hailstorm on the prairie  bringing down <unk> deer it can not be said that <name> <name> 's venture as a ranchman was a very successful one , and it is doubtful if he expected to make much money out of it .
he lost nothing in a financial way , and there is no doubt but that the experience was of great benefit to him .
in this <unk> he met all sorts and conditions of men , and grew to know them thoroughly .
in the past his dealings had been almost entirely with people of large cities and towns , and with men of learning and large business affairs ; here he fell in with the wildest kind of cowboys and frontiersmen .
some he soon found were not fit to be associated with , but the majority proved as honest and hard-working fellows as could be met with anywhere .
many of these loved the young " boss " from the start , and when , years later , the war with spain broke out , and there was a call to arms , not a few of them insisted upon joining the rough riders just to be near <name> <name> once more .
around the ranches owned by <name> <name> there were more or less grouse of the <unk> variety .
as this sort of game made excellent eating , ranchmen and regular hunters did not hesitate to bring them down at every opportunity .
one afternoon <name> <name> left his ranch to visit the shack of one of his <unk> , about thirty-five miles down the river .
it was a cold , clear day , and he was finely mounted on a <unk> pony .
he writes that he was after grouse , hoping to get quite a number of them .
he had trusted to reach the shack long before sundown , but the way was bad , over bottoms covered with thin ice and snow , and soon darkness came on , leaving him practically lost in the cottonwoods that lined the watercourse .
what to do the young ranchman did not know , and it is safe to say that he wished himself heartily out of the difficulty .
it was so dark he could not see three yards ahead of him , and it was only by the merest accident that he struck the shack at last , and then he found it empty , for the <unk> had gone off elsewhere on business .
so far <name> had seen no game , so he was without food , and what made matters worse , the larder of the shack proved to be empty .
all he had with him was a little package of tea .
it was a dismal outlook truly , and especially on such a cold night .
but firewood was at hand , and after turning his pony loose to shift for itself , the future president of our country started up housekeeping for himself by lighting a fire , bringing in some water from under the ice of the river , and brewing himself a good , strong cup of tea !
it was not a very nourishing meal , but it was all he had , and soon after that he went to sleep , trusting for better luck in the morning .
he was up almost before daybreak , and my young readers can rest assured that by that time his appetite was decidedly keen .
listening intently , he could hear the grouse drumming in the woods close by .
" i must have some of them , and that directly , " he told himself , and rifle in hand lost no time in making his way to the woods .
by keeping out of sight behind the brushwood he managed to get quite close to the game , and so brought down one after another until he had five .
such success was a great satisfaction to him , and returning to the shack he fixed himself a breakfast of broiled <unk> , to which he did full justice .
it was not all play at the ranches , and sometimes <name> <name> went out with his men to round up the cattle and help " cut out " what was his own .
this was hard work , for frequently the cattle did not want to be separated from the beasts belonging to another ranchman .
more than once an angry cow or a bull would charge , and then there would be a lively scramble on <unk> or on foot to get out of the way .
sometimes , too , the cattle would wander off and get lost , and then a long and hard hunt would be necessary in order to find them again .
but there was fun as well as hard work , and mr. <name> has told one story about a skunk that is sure to be remembered .
he says that <unk> were very numerous , and that they were more feared than larger animals by the cowboys because the bite was sure to bring on hydrophobia .
one night a number of the cowboys and mr. <name> were sleeping in a hut .
a skunk came along , and after a time worked its way into the hut .
it got among the pots and pans and made a noise which quickly awoke a scotchman named <name> .
thinking something was wrong , <name> struck a light , and seeing the eyes of the skunk , fired .
but his aim was bad , and the animal fled .
" what were you firing at ? "
asked half a dozen of the other cowboys .
the scotchman explained , and , satisfied that it had been a skunk , the others told him he had better leave the animal alone or there would be trouble .
nobody thought the skunk would come back , but it did , and again <name> heard it among the pots and pans .
this was too much for his scotch blood , and taking aim once more , he fired and gave the skunk a mortal wound .
at once the hut was filled with a powerful odor that made all the inmates rush for the open air .
" now see what you have done ! "
cried several , indignantly .
" hoot mon ! "
answered the scotchman , holding his nose tightly , " a <unk> <name> 'twould cause sec ' a <unk> ! "
and after that we may be sure that <name> let <unk> severely alone .
hunting in the summer time , or when the weather was but moderately cold , was well enough , but hunting in the dead of <name> was quite a different thing .
then the thermometer would frequently drop to thirty and forty degrees below zero , and there would be a cutting " <unk> " fit to freeze the very marrow in one 's bones .
seldom was there much snow , but when it came , it caused a veritable blizzard , during which neither man nor beast felt like stirring out .
it was during such weather that <name> <name> once had the tip of his nose and one cheek frozen  something that caused him not a little pain and trouble for a long time afterward .
it was in those dreary days that the logs were piled high in the broad fireplace of the ranch home , and <name> <name> spent his days in reading and studying , in writing letters to his friends and relatives , and in <unk> some of the hunting sketches that have won him literary fame .
one day , early in the <name> , <name> <name> and his foreman went out to see if they could not bring in two <unk> deer which had been seen in the vicinity of the ranch the day before .
one of the deer , a large <name> , had been shot in the ankle by the foreman , so the beginning of the trail was easy to follow .
the <name> and his mate had gone into a thicket , and it was likely that there the pair had spent the night .
" we 'll have our own trouble finding the tracks again , " said the foreman .
and so it proved ; for during the night some cattle and other animals had passed in and out of the thicket , which covered a large extent of territory .
at last the hunters hit upon the right trail , and the foreman went ahead , leaving <name> to keep somewhat toward the outside of the cover .
both were wide-awake and on the alert , and presently the foreman announced that he had found the spot where the wounded <name> had passed the night .
" he is not very far from here , " said the foreman , and hardly had he said this than <name> <name> heard a cracking of fallen twigs and a breaking of the brush and lower limbs of the trees as the <name> rushed through the thicket .
he ran with all speed in the direction and took station behind a large tree .
only a few seconds passed , and then the <name> showed his head and antlers among the brushwood .
he was gazing ahead anxiously , no doubt trying to decide if it would be safe to leap into the open and run up the trail .
then he turned his gaze directly toward where <name> <name> was crouching , rifle in hand .
another instant and it would have been too late .
but just as the <unk> head was turned and he sniffed the air suspiciously , the young ranchman pulled the trigger .
" he turned his head sharply toward me as i raised the rifle , " says mr. <name> , in writing of this adventure , " and the bullet went fairly into his throat , just under the jaw , breaking his neck , and bringing him down in his tracks with hardly a kick . "
the <name> proved to be an extra fine one , and the two hunters lost no time in dressing the game and taking it to the ranch .
not wishing to go back for their horses , the two dragged the game over the snow , each taking hold of an <unk> for that purpose .
it was intensely cold , so that each of the hunters had to drag first with one hand and then with the other for fear of having his fingers frozen .
this was one of the times when the young ranchman and <name> was successful in his quest .
but mr. <name> has not hesitated to tell of the many times he has gone out on the hunt only to return empty-handed and glad enough to get back to a warm shelter and where he was sure of a good meal .
" <unk> and hunting was no bed of roses , " some one who knew him at that time has said .
" many a time he came back utterly fagged out and not a thing to show for his labor .
but he never complained , and on the contrary could generally tell a pretty good story about something he had seen or had taken note of .
in the summer he would examine the nests of birds and <unk> with great care , and i have seen him with a horned frog before him , studying every point of the creature . "
once while on the prairie the young ranchman was caught in a heavy hailstorm .
he was out with a number of others , when , with scarcely any warning , the sky began to grow dark , and the wind came up in fitful gusts .
" we must get out of this , and quick too , " said a companion .
and all pushed onward as fast as they could .
but soon the heavy fall of hail overtook them , and they were glad enough to seek even the slight shelter of a deep <unk> , where men and horses huddled close together for protection .
the <unk> came down as large as marbles , causing the horses to jump around in a fashion that was particularly dangerous to themselves and to their owners .
the time was <name> , yet the air grew very cold , and when the storm was over , some cattle were found completely benumbed .
a few had been killed , and there had likewise been great slaughter among a flock of lambs that had been driven into the bad lands the year previous .
mr. <name> tells us that the greatest number of <unk> deer he ever killed in one day was three .
he is a true sportsman in this respect and does not kill for the mere sake of killing .
those who go out just to slaughter all they possibly can are not sportsmen , but butchers .
to be sure , a <name> may have to play the butcher at times , when the meat is needed , but not otherwise .
on the occasion when the three <unk> were laid low the young ranchman and his foreman started on the hunt very early in the morning , when the bright moon was still in the sky .
it was late in november and stinging cold , so they allowed their horses to take their own pace , which was far from slow .
the course of the hunters was up the bed of a dry creek , along which they passed the still sleeping cattle and also a drove of ponies .
then they reached a spot where they left their own steeds , and , rifles in hand , hurried silently toward a great plateau which lay some distance before them .
signs of deer could be seen on every hand , and both were certain that the day 's outing would prove a grand success .
<name> <name> had separated from his companion when of a sudden he caught sight of a beautiful doe .
it was a fair shot , and dropping on one knee he took aim and fired .
but to his intense chagrin the doe bounded off and disappeared in the brushwood .
" hit anything ? "
sang out the foreman .
" i am afraid not , " was the answer .
" never mind ; better luck next time . "
and then both sank down behind a rock where they could get a good view of a hollow ahead of them .
they had been behind the rock but a short time when they heard a cracking of twigs , and a fine <unk> <name> came cautiously into view .
both fired , and the <name> rolled over , never to rise again .
then another deer came into view and both fired again , but the game was not struck and lost no time in disappearing .
" never mind ; one is n't so bad , " said <name> <name> , and his companion agreed with him .
the hunters now decided to go forward into the hollow and look for the doe <name> <name> had missed .
this was done , and soon the foreman pointed to some drops and <unk> of blood .
" must have hit her , after all , " said the foreman .
" we can take our time about following her up .
we 'll be sure to get her sooner or later . "
but locating the wounded doe proved not so easy , after all .
the trail was followed for some time , but was lost on the hard ground higher up ; and at last the two hunters agreed to look for new game .
they had lunch , and then started out nearly as fresh as before when suddenly the foreman called out :  " there 's your game all right ! "
he pointed to a clump of bushes , and running forward , both saw the doe stretched out , stiff and cold .
she had been mortally wounded , after all , much to both hunters ' gratification .
so far the hunting had been on foot , but now the hunters took again to their steeds .
mr. <name> says he was wishing for just one more shot , to see if he could not do better than before , when his wish was gratified .
just ahead a <unk> <unk> <name> leaped into view and cantered away .
after the <name> went both hunters , but <name> <name> was in the lead , and this time determined to make no miss or poor shot .
he waited until the <name> turned its side to him , then fired with especial care .
the game staggered on , then fell .
the bullet had gone clean through its body , and in a few seconds it breathed its last .
chapter vii runs for mayor of new york city  marriage to <name> <name> <unk>  hunting in the <unk> mountains  a wild <name> after three elk although <name> <name> was devoting himself to <unk> , hunting , and literary work in north <name> he had by no means given up his residence in new york or at oyster bay .
more than this , he still continued his connection with the republican party in spite of the <unk> at the last national convention .
in 1886 , while <name> <name> was still president of the united states , there was an exceedingly sharp and bitter fight in new york city over the office of mayor .
there was great discontent both in the republican and the democratic party , and nobody could tell what was going to happen on election day .
" let us put up <name> <name> , " said some of the republicans , and shortly after this <name> <name> was nominated for mayor of new york .
his regular opponent was <name> hewitt , while the <unk> put up <name> <name> , the " single tax " man , well known as the author of a book entitled " progress and poverty . "
from the very start the campaign was an exceedingly hot one , and there was a good deal of parading and <unk> .
many clubs were organized in behalf of <name> <name> , and clubs were likewise formed to support the other candidates .
the supporters of <name> <name> came from both regular parties , so political matters became very much mixed up .
" there is no show for <name> unless <name> <unk> , " said more than one old politician .
" and <name> wo n't withdraw , " added others .
and so it proved .
<name> <name> was exceptionally strong with the poorer classes , and on election day he <unk> over <unk> votes ; <unk> votes were cast for hewitt , while <name> received <unk> votes .
it was certainly a disheartening defeat , and many a man would have retired from the political field , never to show himself again .
but <name> <name> was made of sterner stuff .
he held his ground and went his way as before , resolved to do his duty as it should present itself .
it was about this time that his intimacy with miss <name> <name> <unk> was renewed .
it <name> be remembered that she had been his playmate during his earlier days around union square .
in the years that had followed she had been graduated from a young ladies ' seminary and had travelled abroad , visiting london , <name> , and other large cities .
now she was home again , and on december 2 , 1886 , she became mr. <name> 's wife .
mr. <name> 's second marriage has been a very happy one .
mrs. <name> is a loving wife and a gracious mistress of the white house .
five children have come to bless their union , of which more <name> be said later .
mrs. <name> at once took mr. <name> 's daughter <name> to her heart , and from that time to this the two have been as mother and daughter .
<name> <name> had already produced his " naval war of 1812 " and his " hunting trips of a ranchman , " both spoken of in previous pages .
a short while after he was married the second time he brought out a " life of <name> <name> , " and a year later a " life of <unk> <name> . "
in addition to this he wrote a number of articles for the magazines , and also some short stories for young folks .
all were well received and added not a little to his literary reputation .
but the <name> to be out in the open , to roam the prairie and to hunt , was in his veins , and again and again he visited his ranches in the bad lands , and took hunting trips in other directions .
sometimes he cared little or nothing for the game brought down , and at others he went on the hunt with great deliberation , for " something worth while , " as he expressed it .
how careful he could be on the latter occasions is shown by his printed views on hunting , in which he <unk> the best rifles , <unk> , and pistols to use , the best knives to <name> , how to dress with comfort , and how to follow up game , on horseback and on foot , in the open and when in the woods or in the short brush .
he has also told us much about the habits of the beasts and birds that he has hunted , showing that he followed the sport intelligently and not in the haphazard fashion of many who go out merely to get a big <unk> of game .
[ illustration : <name> <name> <name> ] hunting was not all fun in those days .
we have already related how <name> <name> was caught in a heavy hailstorm .
at another time he and his companions were caught in a <unk> ' <unk> , during which the wind blew a hurricane .
they were miles away from the ranch home , and it was utterly impossible to move in any direction .
" reckon we are booked to stay here , " said one of the cowboys , a fellow from the south .
" it 's a right smart storm , and it 's going to stay by us . "
and stay by them it did , until the party were almost out of provisions .
they got what shelter they could in something of a hollow overhung with trees and brush , but this was not very satisfactory , and all were soaked to the skin , and the blankets in which they rolled themselves at night were both wet and muddy .
" <name> <name> did n't like that wetting , and i know it , " one of the cowboys has said since .
" but he did n't grumble near as much as some of the others .
we had to take our medicine , and he took his like a man . "
there were no elk in the immediate vicinity of <name> <unk> ranches , nor were there many bears or buffaloes .
but all of these animals were to be met with further westward , and the young ranchman had been after them during a previous year 's hunting while on a trip to montana and <unk> .
at that time the destination of the party was the <unk> mountains , which were reached only after a painful and disheartening journey over a very uncertain indian trail , during which one of the ponies fell into a <unk> and broke his neck , and a mule stuck fast in a <unk> and was extricated only after hours of hard work .
" it was on the second day of our journey into the mountains that i got my first sight of elk , " says mr. <name> .
the party was on the trail leading into a broad valley , moving slowly and cautiously along through a patch of pine trees .
when the bottom of the valley was gained , mr. <name> saw a herd of cow elk at a great distance , and soon after took a shot at one , but failed to reach his <name> .
" i 'm going after that herd , " he said .
and as soon as the party had pitched camp , he sallied forth in one direction , while his foreman , <unk> , took another .
as <name> <name> had supposed , the elk had gone off in a bunch , and for some distance it was easy to follow them .
but further on the herd had spread out , and he had to follow with more care , for fear of getting on the wrong trail , for elk tracks ran in all directions over the mountains .
these tracks are there to-day , but the elk and the bears are fast disappearing , for ruthless hunters have done their best to exterminate the game .
after passing along for several miles , <name> <name> felt he must be drawing close to the herd .
just then his rifle happened to tap on the trunk of a tree , and instantly he heard the elk moving away in new alarm .
his hunting blood was now aroused , and he rushed forward with all speed , but as silently as possible .
by taking a short cut , the young ranchman managed to come up beside the running elk .
they were less than twenty yards away , and had it not been for the many trees which were on every side , he would have had an excellent shot at them .
as it was he brought low a fine , full-grown cow elk , and hit a bull calf in the hind leg .
later on he took up the trail of the calf and finished that also .
of this herd the foreman also brought down two , so that for the time being the hunters had all the meat they needed .
but <name> <name> was anxious to obtain some elk horns as trophies of the <name> , and day after day a watch was kept for bull elk , as the hunters moved the camp from one place to another .
at last the <unk> opportunity arrived .
three big bulls were seen , and <name> and his man went after them with all possible speed .
they were on foot , and the trail led them over some soft ground , and then through a big patch of burnt timber .
here running was by no means easy , and more than once both hunters pitched headlong into the dirt and soot , until they were covered from head to foot .
but <name> <name> was bound to get the elk , and kept on until the sweat was pouring down his face and neck .
shot after shot was fired , and all three of the animals were wounded , but still they kept on bounding away .
" one is down ! "
shouted <name> at last .
and the news proved true ; the smallest of the bulls had rocked unsteadily for a few seconds and gone to earth .
then on and on after the remaining game sped the hunters , panting and sweating as before .
" the sweat streamed down in my eyes and made furrows in the <unk> mud that covered my face , from having fallen full length down on the burnt earth , " writes the dauntless <name> , in relating this story .
" i sobbed for breath as i toiled at a <unk> trot after them , as nearly done out as could well be . "
but he did not give up ; and now the elk took a turn and went downhill , with <name> <name> pitching after them , ready to drop from exhaustion , but full of that grit to win out which has since won the admiration of all who know the man .
the second bull fell ; and now but one remained , and this dashed into a thicket .
on its heels went the daring <name> , running the chance of having the elk turn on him as soon as cornered , in which case , had <name> 's rifle been empty , the struggle for life on both sides would have been a fierce one .
in the midst of the thicket the <name> had to pause , for the elk was now out of sight , and there was no telling what new course had been taken by the game .
at a distance he saw a yellow body under the evergreen trees , and , taking hasty aim , fired .
when he came up , he was somewhat dismayed to learn that he had not brought down the elk , but a <unk> deer instead .
in the meantime , the elk got away , and it proved impossible to pick up the trail again .
there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this hunting trip , and one that all young readers should take to heart .
it shows what sticking at a thing can accomplish .
mr. <name> had determined to get at least a portion of that game , no matter what the labor and hardship involved .
many a <name> would have given up in disgust or despair after the first few shots were fired and it looked as if the elk were out of range and intended to keep out .
but this determined young man did not give up thus easily .
hard as was that run up hill and down , and regardless of the tumbles taken , and that he was so tired he could scarcely stand , he kept on until two elk were brought down , and it was firmly settled that the third could not be captured .
the way to accomplish anything in this life is to stick at it .
<name> <name> understood this truth even when he went to college , for in the harvard journal of which he was an editor he wrote , speaking of <unk> practice , " what is most necessary is that every man should realize the necessity of faithful and honest work , every afternoon . "
he put " every afternoon " in italics himself , and he meant that every <unk> player who hoped to win in the <unk> <unk> games should stick at it until he had made himself as perfect a player as possible .
a victory worth gaining is worth working for , and usually the <unk> victories are the sweetest .
chapter viii bringing down a grizzly bear  back to new york  appointed a civil service commissioner  the work of the commission it was while in the <unk> mountains that <name> <name> got his first shot at a bear .
he had been wanting such a chance for a good many years , but up to that date the bears had kept well out of his sight .
in his writings he has said much about bears , both common and grizzly , and told of their habits , and how they have been tracked down and shot at various times of the year .
he holds to the opinion that the average bear would rather run away than fight , yet he tells the story of how one bear faced the <name> who had shot him , and gave the man one blow with his powerful paw that proved fatal .
one day his companion of the hunt came riding in with the carcass of a black bear killed in a network of hollows and ravines some miles from their present camp .
" the hollows are full of bear tracks , " said <unk> .
" i am sure , if we go up there , we 'll get one or more black bears and perhaps a grizzly . "
" then let us go by all means , " responded <name> <name> .
and no time was lost in moving to the new locality .
the hunters had been out nearly all of the next day , when , on returning through the forest toward nightfall , <name> came across the <unk> of a large bear .
he tried to follow them , but night closed in on him , and he had to return to camp .
that very night the bear came around the camp , looking for something to eat .
" let us try to bring him down , " cried <name> , seizing his rifle , while his companion did the same .
but outside it was pitch dark .
" do you see him ? "
questioned <unk> .
" no . "
" neither do i . "
" listen . "
both listened , and at a distance heard the bear lumbering off slowly through the woods .
they went forward a short distance , then came to a halt .
" we 'll have to give it up for the present , " said <name> <name> .
" but i am going to have him , sooner or later , if the thing is possible . "
early the next morning both of the hunters sallied forth and discovered that the bear had been at the carcasses of some game left in the forest .
the tracks were fresh .
" he has been here , no doubt of it , " said <unk> .
" shall we wait for him to come again ? "
" we might as well , " was the answer .
" he 'll get hungry again , sooner or later . "
so the pair sat down to watch .
but the bear was shy , and kept his distance .
then it grew dark once more , so that but little could be seen under the trees .
" he knows enough to keep away , " said <name> 's companion .
" hark ! "
was the reply and both strained their ears .
there was a faint crackling of twigs , and they felt certain it was the bear .
but it was too dark to see anything ; so both shouldered their rifles and walked back to camp .
here was another illustration of <name> <name> 's method of sticking at a thing .
two days had been spent in trying to get that bear , and yet he did not give up .
on the following morning he sallied forth once more , as full of <name> as before .
the bear had been at the carcass again , and the trail was now one to be followed with ease .
" i 'm going to hunt him down to his lair , " said <name> <name> , and stalked off with his companion beside him .
soon they were again deep in the woods , walking perhaps where the foot of white man had never before trod .
fallen trees were everywhere , and over these they often had to climb .
" getting closer , " whispered <name> 's companion , and pointed to some fresh claw scratches on the bark of fallen trees .
they now moved forward as silently as indians , sure that the bear could not be far off .
suddenly <unk> dropped on his knee as if to take aim .
<name> sprang to the front , with rifle raised .
the bear was there , standing upright , only a few paces away .
without hesitation <name> <name> fired .
his aim was true , and the great beast fell with a bullet straight between the eyes .
the leaden messenger had entered his <name> , and he died with scarcely a struggle .
" the whole thing was over in twenty seconds from the time i caught sight of the game , " writes mr. <name> , in his book " hunting trips on the prairies " ( part ii of " hunting trips of a ranchman " ) .
" indeed it was over so quickly that the grizzly did not have time to show fight at all or come a step toward me .
it was the first i had ever seen , and i felt not a little proud as i stood over the great <unk> bulk which lay stretched out at length in the cool shade of the evergreens .
he was a monstrous fellow , much larger than any i have seen since , whether alive or brought in dead by hunters .
as near as we could estimate he must have weighed about twelve hundred pounds . "
there is a bear story for you , boys .
and the best of it is , it is every word true .
in later years <name> <name> brought down many more <unk> , but i doubt if he was as proud of them as he was of that first capture .
while <name> <name> was spending a large part of his time in hunting and in literary work , and in studying political economy , <name> <name> 's first term as president came to an end , and <name> <name> was inaugurated to fill the office of chief magistrate .
at that time the question of civil service was again being agitated .
<name> <name> was a warm advocate of the merit system , and knowing this , president <name> appointed him , in 1889 , a civil service commissioner , and this office he held for six years , until his resignation in 1895 .
when <name> <name> 's term of office was up , and <name> <name> was <unk> to the presidency , it was thought that <name> would have to go , but his friend , the newly elected president , wished him to remain as a commissioner , and he did so for two years longer , thus serving both under a republican and a democratic administration .
to some of my young readers the term civil service , as applied here , may be a bit perplexing .
for the benefit of such let me state that civil service here applies to the thousands of persons who work for the government , such as post-office clerks , letter carriers , clerks in the various departments at washington , like the treasury , the congressional library , the government printing office , the war department , and the hundred and one other branches in which uncle <name> needs assistance .
for seventy or eighty years these various positions had been under what is commonly called the " spoils system . "
" to the <name> belong the spoils , " had been the old motto , which generally meant that the party happening to be in power could do as it pleased about dealing out employment to those under it .
a worker might have been ever so faithful in the discharge of his duties , but if the administration was changed , he ran the risk of losing his position without any notice .
statesmen of both great political parties had long seen the injustice of the spoils system , but few cared to take the matter up for fear of offending their political friends .
but as matters grew worse , those who were honest said they would stand such a system no longer , and they began to advocate the merit plan , whereby each worker for our government should stand on his merit , so that he could not be removed from his position without just cause .
this merit system is in operation to-day and is a most excellent thing , only becoming dangerous when extended too far .
there were two other commissioners besides mr. <name> on the commission , but all worked together in <name> , although in many moves taken mr. <name> was the leader .
about this work he has written a notable essay called " six years of civil service reform , " in which he reviews much of the work done .
in this essay , among many other things , he says :  " no republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base ; and the spoils system ,  the application in political life of the degrading doctrine that to the <name> belong the spoils ,  produces corruption and degradation .
the man who is in politics for the offices might just as well be in politics for the money he can get for his vote , so far as the general good is concerned . "
certainly wise words and well worth remembering .
the work of the commission was by no means easy , and the members were often accused of doing some things merely to benefit their own particular party or friends .
politicians of the old sort , who wanted everything they could lay hands on , fought civil service bitterly , and even those who might have been expected to help often held back , fearing they would lose their own popularity .
yet on the other hand , some members of congress upheld the commission nobly , and when president <name> was assassinated by a <unk> <unk> many more came forward and <unk> to put public offices on the merit system by all means .
part of the work of the commission was to prosecute the head of any bureau or department where an employee had been discharged or had suffered without just cause .
such cases came up in large <name> and were prosecuted with all the vigor of which the commission were capable .
" we were not always successful in these trials , " says mr. <name> .
" but we won out in the majority of cases , and we gave the wrong-doing such a wide publicity that those who were guilty hesitated to repeat their actions . "
and he goes on to add that during his term of service not over one per cent .
of those who worked for uncle <name> were dismissed purely for political reasons .
this was certainly an excellent record , and our government <name> do well to maintain such a high standard in the future .
to give a further idea of the work required in the way of examinations for positions under our government , let me state that during the year from july 1 , 1890 , to july 1 , 1891 , <unk> applicants were examined for the departments service , <unk> for the customs service , <unk> for the postal service , <unk> for the railway mail service , making a total of nearly 20,000 , of which about <unk> passed and the balance failed .
since our war with spain , the work of the government has been vastly increased , and the places to be filled every year run up into figures that are startling .
one of the best and wisest acts of the commission was to place the colored employees of the government on an equal footing with the white employees .
in the past the colored employees had occupied their places merely through the whim or goodwill of those over them .
now this was changed , and any colored man who could pass the examination , and who was willing to attend strictly to his labor , was as safe in his situation as anybody .
chapter ix a trip to the <unk> mountains  caught in a driving snowstorm  back to work  resignation as civil service commissioner notwithstanding the great amount of labor involved as a civil service commissioner , <name> <name> did not forego the pleasures of the hunt , and in 1891 he made an extended trip to the <unk> mountains in <unk> , going after elk and such other game as might present itself .
on this trip he was accompanied by his ranch partner , a skilled shot named ferguson , and two old hunters named woody and <unk> .
there was also in the party a young fellow who looked after the <unk> , fourteen in number .
the start was made on a beautiful day in <name> , and the party journeyed along at a gait that pleased them , bringing down everything that came to hand and which could be used as meat .
two tents were carried , one for sheltering their packs at night and the other for sleeping purposes .
in his book called " the wilderness <name> , " mr. <name> has given many of the details of this grand hunt , which he says was one of the most exciting as well as most pleasurable undertaken .
with an interest that can not be mistaken , and which betrays the true sportsman at every turn , he gives minute descriptions of how the tents were erected , how everything in camp was put in its proper place , and how on wet days they would huddle around the camp-fire in the middle of the larger tent to keep warm and dry .
he also tells how the packs on the horses were adjusted , and adds that the <name> who can not take care of his outfit while on the hunt , or who must have all his game stalked for him , is a <name> in name only ;  which is literally true , as every genuine sportsman knows .
the young civil service commissioner went out <unk> in a fitting hunting costume , consisting of a buckskin shirt , with stout leggings , and moccasins , or , when occasion required , <unk> boots .
heavy overcoats were also carried and plenty of blankets , and for extra cold nights <name> <name> had a fur <unk> , in which , no doubt , he slept " as snug as a bug in a rug . "
the horses of a pack-train in the wild west are not always thoroughly broken , and although the majority rarely do anything worse than <unk> behind or stray away , yet occasionally one or another <name> indulge in antics far from desired .
this was true on the present occasion , when at different times the <unk> went on a " <unk> " that upset all calculations and scattered packs far and wide , causing a general alarm and hard work on the part of all hands to restore quietness and order .
for two days the hunters pushed on into the mountains with but little signs of game .
then a <unk> set in which made the outlook a dismal one .
" going to have a big storm , " said one of the old hunters .
" never mind , we 'll have to take it as it comes , " was mr. <unk> philosophical answer .
" we ca n't expect good weather every day . "
it was almost noon of that day when all heard the call of a bull elk , echoing over the hills .
the sound came from no great distance , and in the face of the rain , <name> <name> and the <name> named woody set off on foot after the beast , who was still calling as loudly as ever .
it was not long before the hunters could hear the bull plainly , as he pawed the earth , a challenge to another bull who was answering him from a great distance .
" we are gettin ' closer to him , " said woody .
" got to go slow now , or he 'll take alarm and be off like a flash . "
the timber was rather thin , and the ground was covered with moss and fallen leaves , and over this the pair glided as silently as shadows , until woody declared that the bull was not over a hundred yards away .
" and he 's in a tearing rage , on account of that other bull , " he added .
" got to plug him fair and square or there <name> be trouble . "
without replying to this , <name> <name> took the lead , keeping eyes and ears wide open for anything that might come to hand .
then through the trees he caught sight of the stately horns of the elk , as he stood with head thrown back , repeating his call in <unk> tones .
as the hunters came closer , the elk faced around and caught sight of his human enemies .
up went his antlers once more , as if to defy them .
" he 's coming ! "
shouted woody .
and scarcely had he spoken when <name> <name> took aim and fired at the animal .
there was a snort and a gasp , and the elk turned to run away .
then <name> fired a second shot , and over went the monarch of the forest in his death agony .
it was a fine bit of game to bring down , the antlers having twelve prongs .
the head was cut off and taken back to camp , along with a small part of the best of the meat .
after that the forward march was resumed in the face of a sweeping rain that wet everybody to the skin .
on they went until , just as the rain ceased , they reached a bold plateau , overlooking what is called <unk> pass , a wild and wonderful freak of nature , surrounded by lofty mountains and watered by streams and <name> flowing in several directions .
far up the mountains could be seen the <unk> , while lower down were the heavy forests and underbrush , the haunts of the game they were seeking .
in this wonderland <name> <name> hunted to his heart 's content for many days  bringing down several more elk and also a fair variety of smaller game .
it was now growing colder , and knowing that the <name> season was close at hand , the hunters decided to strike camp and return homeward .
the movement was made none too soon .
the snow was already filling the air , and one morning , on coming from his tent , <name> <name> found the ground covered to a depth of a foot and a half .
to add to his discomfort the pony he was riding began to <name> that day and managed to <unk> his rider 's thumb .
but <name> <name> stuck to him and showed him who was master ; and after that matters went better .
the snow continued to come down , and before the end of the journey was reached , at great geyser basin , the hunters almost perished from the cold .
such pictures as the above give us some idea of the varied life that <name> <name> has led .
even at this early age  he was but thirty-three years old  he had been a college student , a traveller , an author , an assemblyman , a ranchman and <name> , and a civil service commissioner .
he had travelled the length and breadth of europe and through a large section of our own country .
he had visited the palaces of kings and the <unk> of the humble cowboys of the far west , he had met men in high places and in low , and had seen them at their best and at their worst .
surely if " experience is the school wherein man learns wisdom , " then the future president had ample means of growing wise , and his works prove that those means were not neglected .
as already mentioned , when <name> <name> became president a second time , he requested <name> <name> to retain his place on the civil service commission .
this was a practical illustration of the workings of the merit system , and it made for mr. <name> many friends among his former political enemies .
by this movement the workings of the commission were greatly strengthened , so that by the time <name> <name> resigned , on may 5 , 1895 , the commission had added twenty thousand places filled by government employees to those coming under the merit system .
this number was larger than any placed under the system before that time , and the record has scarcely been equalled since .
" he was a fighter for the system , day and night , " says one who knew him at that time .
" he was enthusiastic to the last degree , and had all sorts of statistics at his fingers ' ends .
if anybody in the government employ was doing wrong , he was willing to pitch into that person regardless of consequences .
some few politicians thought he was a crank on the subject , but the results speak for themselves .
some politicians , who wanted the old spoils system retained , were often after him like a swarm of angry hornets , but he never got out of their way , and when they tried to sting , he slapped them in a way that soon made them leave him alone .
and more than that , he was very clever in the way that he presented his case to those representatives and senators who understood the real value of civil service reform .
he made them appreciate what he and his <unk> were trying to do , and when the commission was attacked in congress it always had , as a consequence , a support that could not be easily overthrown . "
when <name> <name> resigned , president <name> wrote as follows to him :  " you are certainly to be congratulated upon the extent and permanency of civil service reform methods which you have so substantially aided in bringing about .
the struggle for its firm establishment and recognition is past .
its faithful application and reasonable expansion remain , subjects of deep interest to all who really <name> the best attainable public service . "
it was high praise for the retiring commissioner , and it was well deserved .
chapter x appointed police commissioner of new york city  <unk> of the department  strenuous efforts to make matters better  a " dry " <name>  enforcing the tenement house law and other measures during the time that <name> <name> was a civil service commissioner there were several important political changes made in new york city .
in the past there had been a great deal of what is familiarly called " machine politics , " and matters had been going from bad to worse .
but now there was an upward turn by the election of <name> s. strong to the office of mayor .
mr. strong was a man of high character , and was elected by a vote that combined the best elements of all the political parties .
it was at a time when new york city was in urgent need of reform .
those in power were doing but little to stop the corruption that was stalking abroad upon every hand .
bribes were given and taken in nearly all departments , clerks were being paid large salaries for doing practically nothing , and contracts were put out , not to those who could do the best work , but to those who would pay the political <unk> the most money for them .
the record of the police department was perhaps the blackest of the lot .
it was to this department that the citizens looked for protection from crime , yet it was known that many in the department winked at all sorts of vice , providing they were properly paid for so doing .
saloons and worse resorts were kept open in defiance of the law , and wickedness <unk> itself in the face of the public in a manner that was truly shocking .
occasionally a private citizen would try to do something to mend matters , but his complaint was generally " <unk> , " and that would be the end of the matter .
the <unk> , as it was well called , extended from the highest places in the department to the lowest , so that it was said not even a policeman could secure his appointment without paying several hundred dollars for it , and this he was , of course , expected to get back by <unk> those who lived or did business on his beat .
and get it back the policeman would , even if he had to make an italian fruit dealer pay him a dollar a month for having a stand on the sidewalk , where the walk was supposed to be free from obstruction .
when <name> strong came into office , the first thing he did was to cast his eyes about him for reliable men who might aid him in purifying the city .
he already knew of <name> <name> 's work as an assemblyman and a civil service commissioner .
" mr. <name> is just the man to take the office of police commissioner and put the department on an honorable basis , " said the newly elected mayor , and he lost no time in <unk> the office to mr. <name> .
the tender was accepted , and <name> <name> was sworn into his new position on may 24 , 1895 .
the appointment of mr. <name> to the office of police commissioner was a great shock to nearly the entire police department .
he was known for his <name> honesty , and it was felt that he would not <unk> crime in any shape or form .
" there <name> be a grand shaking up , " said more than one .
" just you wait till he gets to the bottom of things .
he 'll turn the light on in a way that <name> make more than one officer tremble in his boots . "
on the board with mr. <name> were <name> d. <name> , <name> d. andrews , and <name> d. <name> , the latter the son of former president <name> .
<name> <name> was chosen president , and the board lost no time in getting to work .
" the new board found the department in a demoralized condition , " says mr. <name> , in his report on the matter .
" a recent grand jury had investigated the records of many officers , and many <unk> had been found ; 268 vacancies existed in the department , and 26 officers , including one inspector and five captains , were under suspension on account of indictment for crime . "
this was truly a sad state of affairs , and a horrible example to the other large cities of our union .
the commissioners went to work with a <name> , and <name> <name> was the leading spirit in every move made .
every branch of the police department was given an <unk> , and those who would not do their duty were promptly dismissed , while minor offences were met with heavy fines .
by an act of the legislature the force of men was increased to eight hundred , to keep pace with the growth of the metropolis .
the men who were particularly faithful in the discharge of their duties were rewarded by honorable mention , engrossed certificates , medals of honor , and by <unk> .
more than this , they were given to understand that if they did their duty faithfully they need not fear trouble from those over them , no matter what changes were made .
no officer was allowed to accept blackmail money from those lower in the service ; and above all , no politics were to interfere with the fair and square running of the whole department .
it was a gigantic task , and it can not be said that it was totally successful , for the opposition in some quarters was strong .
more than once mr. <name> was threatened with violence , but , as when an assemblyman , he paid but scant attention to these mutterings .
his habits of personally investigating matters still clung to him , and it is well remembered how he went around at odd hours of the day and night , and on sundays , seeing if the policemen were really doing their duty .
there had been a boast that all policemen were at their posts at night .
mr. <name> went out once and found just two out of an even dozen where they should be .
then began that " shaking up " that has resulted in better police service in new york to this day .
the effect of the new vigor in the police department was felt in many other ways .
there was a <unk> law regarding buildings which were unfit for human habitations .
new york city was crowded with such buildings , but nobody had ordered them torn down , because either nobody wanted to bother , or the owners paid blackmail money to keep them standing for the rent they could get out of them .
" those tenements must come down , " said <name> <name> .
" if you order them down , the owners <name> fight you to the bitter end , " said another officer of the department .
" i do n't care if they do .
the houses are a menace to life and health .
they are filthy , and if a fire ever started in them , some would prove regular traps .
they have got to go . "
and shortly after that about a hundred were seized , and the most destroyed .
the <unk> of the <name> liquor law was another thing that occasioned great surprise during mr. <name> 's term as police commissioner .
in the past , saloons had been almost as wide open on sundays as on week days .
on account of the cosmopolitan character of the population it was thought that to close up the saloons on sundays would be impossible .
but the police force was given strict orders , and on one <name> in <name> , 1895 , new york city had the first " dry " <name> that it could remember in many years .
this " dry " <name> provoked a new storm of opposition , especially from many of foreign birth , who were used to getting liquor as easily on that day as on any other .
more threats were made against the vigorous commissioner , and on two occasions dynamite bombs were placed in his desk , evidently with the <name> that they would explode and blow him to pieces .
but the bombs were found in time , and no damage was done , and <name> <name> paid scant attention to them .
after that he was attacked in a new way .
some of the politicians laid traps for him whereby they hoped to bring discredit to his management of the department .
the fight grew very hot and very bitter , and he was accused of doing many things , " just for the looks of them , " rather than to benefit the public at large .
but he kept on his way , and at last the opposition were silenced to such an extent that they merely growled behind his back .
for many years a large number of shiftless and often lawless men , and women too , were attracted to the metropolis because of the " <unk> lodging houses " located there .
these resorts were continually filled by <unk> who would not work and who were a constant menace to society at large .
" we must get rid of those lodging houses , " said mr. <name> .
" they simply breed crime .
no respectable man or woman , no matter how poor , <name> enter them . "
" but we 'll have to have some sort of shelter for the poor people , " said others .
" to be sure  for those who are deserving .
the others should be driven off and discouraged , " answered mr. <name> .
and one by one the <unk> lodging places were abolished .
in their place the board of charities opened a municipal lodging house , where those who were deserving were received , were made to bathe , and given proper shelter and nourishment .
a story is told that , during the excitement attending the closing of saloons on <name> , a friend came to mr. <name> and told about hearing some <unk> plotting to harm him .
" what can they do ? "
demanded the police commissioner .
" i am afraid they can do a good deal , " was the answer .
" each of those men has a barkeeper who has been in jail for various crimes .
they may attack you some dark night and kill you . "
" perhaps i wo n't give them the chance , " answered the man who had been on many a dangerous hunt in the wild west .
" if they can shoot , so can i . "
" but they may sneak up behind you and knock you out , " insisted the visitor .
" well , if they do that , i shall have died doing my duty , " was the calm answer made by the future hero of the rough riders .
chapter xi appointed first assistant secretary of the navy  the condition of affairs in cuba  preparing for war  <name> <name> 's resolve while <name> <name> was serving as police commissioner of the city of new york , <name> <name> ran for the presidency of the united states the first time and was elected .
the young commissioner was a firm <unk> of <name> , for he did not believe in " free silver " as it was called , but in " sound money , " which meant that in the future , as in the past , all national indebtedness should be made payable in gold , instead of in gold and silver , as many desired .
as soon as the new president was inaugurated , march 4 , 1897 , he appointed hon .
<name> d. long to be secretary of the navy .
mr. long knew <name> <name> well , and also knew of the " history of the naval war of 1812 , " which the energetic author and commissioner had written .
" he is just the man we need here , " said mr. long to president <name> .
" he has made a study of the navy , and he is not afraid of work , " and without further delay <name> <name> was asked to resign his position in the metropolis and come to washington , where he was duly installed as first assistant secretary of the navy .
in his new position , certainly a high one for such a young man to occupy , mr. <name> had much to do .
as first assistant , nearly the whole responsibility of the real workings of the department fell upon his shoulders .
he took up these responsibilities manfully , and how well he succeeded in the work , history has abundantly proved .
" it was <name> 's work that made <name> 's victory at manila possible , " one who knew of the inner workings of the department has said , and another has said that the victory off <name> bay was also due in part to <name> 's watchfulness over the ships that took part in that conflict .
at washington the assistant secretary found an <name> of extravagance equal to that which he had discovered in new york .
the navy department was paying dearly for almost everything it bought , and many laborers and others were drawing high wages for doing little or no work .
against this <name> <name> set his face <unk> , so that inside of a year the actual saving to our government was twenty-five per cent .
when it is remembered that the navy department spends each year millions of dollars , something of what such a saving means can be realized .
for many years our country had been at peace with the whole world , but now a war cloud showed itself on the horizon , scarcely visible at first , but gradually growing larger and larger .
those at washington watched it with great anxiety , wondering if it would burst , and what would be the result .
cuba had been fighting for <name> for years .
it was under spanish rule , and the people were frightfully oppressed .
to spain they paid vast sums of money and got but little in return .
money that should have gone into improvements  that should have supplied good roads and schools  went into the pockets of the royalty of spain .
when a cuban tried to remonstrate , he could scarcely get a hearing , and this state of affairs went from bad to worse until , in sheer desperation , the cubans declared war on the <unk> , just as in <unk> our own nation threw off the yoke of england .
as my young readers know , cuba lies only a short distance from the southeast coast of <name> .
being so close , it was but natural that our people should take an interest in the struggle at hand .
everybody sympathized with the cubans , and some made offers of assistance .
then , when many cubans were on the verge of starvation , we voted to send them relief in the way of something to eat .
the action of the united states was viewed with suspicion by spain .
the people of that country were certain we wanted to help cuba only in order to " <unk> her up afterward , " as the saying went .
such was not our intention at all , and total cuban <name> to-day <unk> to that fact .
not knowing how far matters might go , president <name> and his advisers deemed it wise to prepare for the worst .
this meant to put the army and navy on the best possible footing in the least possible time .
it was felt that should war come , it would be fought largely on the sea , and nobody realized this more than did <name> <name> .
he was active day and night in the pursuit of his duty , seeing to it that this ship or that was properly manned , and this fortification and that put in proper order to resist attack .
our ships were in all parts of the world , on the atlantic and the pacific , in the far north and the far south , in european waters and <name> <unk> harbor .
each had to be supplied with coal and ammunition and with provisions .
those that were " out of commission , " that is , laid up , generally for repairs , were put into commission with all speed .
a thousand contracts had to be inspected , judged , and passed upon .
outwardly the navy department at washington was moving along as peacefully as ever , internally it was more active than it had been at any time since the great civil war .
" war may come at any moment , " said mr. <name> to his friends .
" and if it does come , there is nothing like being prepared for it . "
about one thing <name> <name> was very particular .
in the past , gun practice on board of our war-ships had been largely a matter of simply going through the motions of handling the guns .
" this <name> not do , " said the assistant secretary .
" our gunners <name> never make good <unk> in that way .
they must practise with powder and ball , shot and shell . "
and after that they did .
such practice cost a round sum of money , and the department was criticised for its <unk> in this direction ; but the worth of it was afterward proven when commodore <name> sank the spanish ships in manila bay , and the atlantic squadron likewise destroyed the enemy 's ships that were trying to escape from <name> harbor .
in those days at washington , <name> <name> made a warm , personal friend of dr. <name> wood .
dr. wood was an army surgeon , who had seen considerable active service while under general miles in the campaigns against the <unk> indians .
mr. <name> has himself told how he and dr. wood would often , after office hours , take long walks out of the city , or play <unk> , or go <unk> when the weather permitted , and during such <unk> their conversation was invariably about the situation in cuba , and what each intended to do should war break out .
" if war actually comes , i intend , by hook or by crook , to get out into the field , " said dr. wood .
" i shall go with you , " answered <name> <name> .
" no more office work for me if there is any fighting to be done . "
in the meantime , as already mentioned , matters in cuba were rapidly approaching a crisis .
spain could not send a large enough army to the island to conquer the people while they were at <name> to roam through the jungles and mountains , and so began to drive men , women , and children into various cities or camps , where they were kept , under penalty of death if they tried to escape .
thus large <name> were torn from their homes , and sent miles and miles away , with no money , and nothing with which to support themselves .
food became scarce and high in price , and many grown folks and children were literally starved to death .
to help these starving people the congress of our country voted to expend fifty thousand dollars from the national treasury .
this excited spain more than ever , and we were accused of trying to prolong the rebellion .
but the deed was done , and many would have had us go farther , and recognize cuba as a free and independent nation .
this <name> was overruled on the ground that our government could not with propriety endanger the peace of the world by taking so serious a step at that time .
but the strength of popular sympathy with an oppressed people was shown by the fact that many americans at grave personal risk went to cuba , and joined the army in one capacity or another , fighting as bravely as if for their own individual rights .
chapter xii destruction of the maine  <name> 's victory  <name> <name> becomes a soldier  organizing the rough riders  various men in the command " the maine has been blown up ! "
such was the awful news which startled this whole nation in the middle of february , 1898 , and which caused the question of war with spain to <unk> without further deliberation .
the maine was a battleship of large size , that had been sent down to the harbor of havana , cuba , on nothing more than a friendly visit .
the explosion that destroyed this <name> vessel occurred about ten o'clock at night , and was heard for miles around .
soon after the explosion , the war-ship began to sink , and over two hundred and fifty sailors and officers lost their lives .
the entire nation was now aroused , and many wanted to go to war with spain immediately .
but the spaniards professed to be ignorant of the cause of the explosion , and said it must have come from the inside of the ship and not the outside .
without delay a board of inquiry was established , and it was settled that the explosion had come from the outside , probably from a mine set by the spaniards in havana harbor .
" this means war , and nothing but war , " said even the wisest of our statesmen .
and so it proved .
without hesitation the whole nation sprang forward to uphold the administration , and in a few days congress passed an appropriation of fifty millions of dollars " for national defence . "
it may be added that this appropriation was passed unanimously , regardless of party politics and regardless of the differences which , in the past , had existed between the north and the south .
we have already learned what had been done to prepare the navy for the conflicts to follow .
now there was even more work on hand , to get the army into shape for service in cuba and on other foreign soil .
the regular army at that time consisted of about twenty-five thousand men , scattered all over the united states ,  on the frontier , at the indian reservations , and along the <unk> .
many of these troops were hurried to camps in the southeast portion of our country , leaving but small garrisons in the far west .
it was realized by president <name> that our regular army could not cope with the troubles at hand , and soon came a call for one hundred and twenty-five thousand volunteers .
these volunteers were to come from the various states and territories , each furnishing its proportion of soldiers according to its population .
these soldiers were quickly collected and marched to the various state camps , there to be sworn into the service of the united states .
the " war fever " was everywhere , and many private parties began to raise companies , while all sorts of independent commands , grand army , confederate veterans , <unk> guards , <name> singing societies , colored guards , and the like , offered their assistance .
even the colleges caught the fever , and men went forth from yale , harvard , princeton , and other institutions of learning to battle for uncle <name> .
the first blow struck at spain was a most effective one .
commodore , afterwards admiral , <name> was at <name> <unk> when the trouble began , and he was directed by the war department to hunt for a spanish fleet somewhere among the philippine islands and engage it .
on <name> , may 1 , came the news that the gallant commodore had reached manila bay , fought the spanish fleet and sunk every hostile ship , and come out of the battle with all of his own ships safe and not a single man killed !
" hurrah !
that shows what our navy can do ! "
cried many citizens .
and they were justly proud .
in the past , foreign nations had looked with something akin to scorn on our vessels and the way they were manned .
now such criticism was silenced ; and this result was , in a certain measure , due to the work of <name> <name> , while first assistant secretary to secretary long .
but <name> <name> was no longer in the department .
he resigned and closed his desk , saying , " my duty here is done ; my place is in the field . "
with such an active nature , it was impossible for him to remain a private citizen while stern war was a reality .
in his own excellent work , " the rough riders , " and in his sworn testimony before the commission of investigation of the spanish war , mr. <name> has given us graphic pictures of how the first united states volunteer cavalry , commonly called the rough riders , happened to be organized , and what it tried to do and did , and this testimony is supplemented by many who know the facts , and who took part in the battles which made the organization famous throughout the length and breadth of our land .
at first <name> <name> thought to attach himself to the militia of new york , but found every place taken .
" let us try one of my massachusetts regiments , " said dr. wood .
and this was also done , with a like result .
" we could fill every place , did we want five times as many men , " said one colonel .
" everybody seems crazy to go . "
this shows how truly patriotic our nation can become when the occasion arises for going to the front .
while <name> <name> and his intimate friend were wondering what to do next , congress authorized the raising of three cavalry regiments , to be composed of the daring <unk> and riders of new mexico , oklahoma , arizona , and indian territory .
" there , that <name> just suit me , " said <name> <name> .
" i know many of those men , and i know we can raise a regiment in no time . "
and without delay he sought out secretary of war <unk> and told him of his hopes .
" i am perfectly willing to give you command of one of those regiments , " said the war secretary .
" i know you are something of a rough rider yourself , and a good marksman to boot . "
this was certainly flattering , but <name> <name> 's head was not turned by the offer .
" i do n't think i am quite ready to take command , " said he .
" i know that i can learn , and that quickly , but it <name> be precious time wasted . "
" well , what do you wish , mr .
<name> ? "
asked the secretary of war , curiously .
" what i should like best of all is for dr. wood to become colonel of the regiment , and for myself to become lieutenant-colonel . "
" very well ; i <name> consult president <name> on the subject , " said the secretary .
the request was granted , and in a few days more colonel wood and lieutenant-colonel <name> sallied forth to organize the rough riders , and fit them for service in cuba .
leaving his family , which now consisted of his wife and six children , the lieutenant-colonel made his way to san <name> , texas , where the regiment was to gather .
previous to going he spent a full week in washington , seeing to it that arrangements were completed for supplying the command with uniforms , carbines , saddles , and other articles which were needed .
this was in itself quite a task , for all of the departments at the capitol were more than busy , and it took a great amount of " <unk> " to get what one wanted .
as soon as it was known that <name> <name> was going to help organize the rough riders , offers from everywhere began to pour in upon him .
not alone did the men of the plains and ranch who knew him want to go , but likewise his old college chums at harvard .
these men , of wealth and good families , were willing to serve in any capacity , if only they could be mustered in .
there were crack <unk> and <unk> players , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and men of fortune , all mixed in with hunters , cowboys , men who had served as sheriffs in the far west , where fighting was an everyday occurrence , some policemen who had served under <name> when he was a police commissioner in new york , and even some indians .
nearly every nationality was represented when it came to blood , and the men ran from the best educated to the most ignorant .
[ illustration : <name> <name> as a rough rider ( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] but there were three tests which every man , private or officer , had to pass .
he had to be in perfect health , he had to know how to ride , and he had to know how to shoot .
to these conditions were afterward added two more : each man had to learn his duty as quickly as he could and had to learn to obey his superiors .
in such a collection of soldiers it was but natural that the real leaders soon asserted themselves .
several of the captains had served in the united states army before ; two were former famous western sheriffs ; and all were full of that pluck and energy which is bound to command success .
in this regiment were some men who had hunted with <name> <name> on more than one occasion .
they knew him well and loved him , and did their best to serve him .
to them he was really their commander , although they officially recognized colonel wood .
they were <unk> " <unk> rough riders , " and the great majority of the people of our nation call them such to this day .
the majority of the command were rather young in years , although a few were of middle age .
but all were tough and hardy , either from athletic training or from years spent in the open air of the great west .
some of them could ride almost any kind of a horse , and " bronco <unk> , " that is , breaking in a wild steed , was common sport among them .
some had spent nearly their entire lives in the saddle , and some could exhibit remarkable skill with their firearms while riding at full speed .
when the men began to come into san <name> , they found but little in the way of accommodations .
but soon tents and blankets were procured .
it is said that good shoes were scarce , but some of the soldiers did not mind going without them .
the regiment was supplied with good rifles , but the cartridges were not made of <unk> powder , which was a bad thing , for smoke sometimes enables an enemy to locate the shooter , when , if <unk> powder were used , nothing could be seen .
each man had also a six shooter , and was to have had a <unk> , but the long knives did not come .
" on to cuba ! "
was the cry .
and it was taken up every day .
the rough riders were eager for the fray .
alas !
little did many of them realize that , once in the " bloody isle , " they would never see their native land again .
chapter xiii in camp at tampa  to port tampa in coal cars  <name> <name> 's quick move to obtain a transport  the wait in the harbor  off for cuba at last that the path of the soldier is not always one full of <name> can easily be proven by what happened to the rough riders when , late in may , they were ordered to tampa , <name> , where a part of the army was gathering in readiness to be transported to cuba .
" we were just wild to go , " says one of the number , in speaking of that time .
" we were tired of staying at san <name> and drilling day in and day out , rain or shine .
i guess everybody felt like <unk> when we piled on to the cars .
" colonel <name>  he was only lieutenant-colonel then  had six troops under him , and he did all he could to make the boys comfortable .
but the cars were crowded , and travelling was so slow it took us four days to reach tampa .
then when we got there , we found everything in confusion .
the railroad yard was <unk> with freight and passenger cars , and nobody was there to tell us where to go or where to find provisions .
" the boys were hungry and tired out , for sleeping on the railroad had been almost out of the question .
there was n't a sign of rations in sight , and it looked as if we would have to stay hungry .
but <name> <name> just put his hand into his own pocket and bought us about all we wanted .
then he <unk> around and found out where we were to go , and in another twenty-four hours we were settled in camp . "
even in camp the rough riders had to put up with continued discomfort .
the weather was warm , flies and mosquitoes were numerous , and the drinking water was not of the best .
the rations were plain , but the rough riders did not mind this , for many of them had often fared worse on the plains .
although it was now a regular military camp that the rough riders were in , it was rather difficult to control some of the men , especially those who had been used to an unusually rough life .
but they were held in check as much as possible by their commanders , and on <name> all attended a church service held by chaplain brown , who spoke to them in a manner that soon claimed their attention .
after but a few days spent in the camp at tampa , within walking distance of many of the fashionable hotels , the command was ordered to port tampa , there to board a transport to sail for some destination not revealed .
but the soldiers knew they were going to cuba , to fight the spaniards and to aid in <unk> cuba , and again there was a loud <unk> .
but immediately on top of this came one of the hardest blows the rough riders had to endure , and one which some of them <name> probably never forget .
as already stated , volunteers from all over our nation were anxious to get into the fight , and it was no easy matter for the authorities at washington to decide who should go and who should be left behind .
" only eight troops of seventy men each of the rough riders <name> embark on the transport , " was the order sent to colonel wood .
more than this , it was ordered that the command should be on board of the transport by the following morning , otherwise it could not go .
" four troops to be left behind ! "
exclaimed <name> <name> .
" too bad , " returned colonel wood .
" every man expects to go , and wants to go . "
it was a hard task to tell some of the men that they could not go .
mr. <name> tells us that many of them actually cried at the news .
they were willing to go under any conditions .
they did not want any pay , they did not want any <unk> if they were disabled , and some , who had money , even offered to pay their way , just for the privilege of fighting for uncle <name> .
after such an exhibition , let nobody dare to say that true patriotism is dying out in this country .
but orders were orders , and as quickly as possible those to go were selected .
then the command marched to the railroad tracks to await the cars .
none came , and they were given orders to march to another track .
this they also did ; but still no train appeared .
" we 'll be left , that is certain , " said colonel wood , anxiously .
" it certainly looks like it , unless we march the boys down to the port . "
" here comes a train ! "
was the cry .
it was a train , but only of empty coal cars .
it was about to pass by when the rough riders halted it .
" what 's the matter with riding down to the port in the coal cars ? "
was the question asked by several .
" good enough ! "
came the answer .
" into the cars , boys , and do n't waste time ! "
and into the dirty coal cars they piled , and persuaded the engineer of the train to take them down to port tampa as quickly as he could .
if there had been bustle and confusion up at tampa , it was far worse at the port .
everybody was in a hurry , and ten thousand soldiers stood around , not knowing what to do with their baggage , and not knowing which of the many transports to board .
at last the rough riders were told to go aboard the <unk> , and started to do so .
" the <unk> ? "
exclaimed a member of another command .
" that is our transport . "
" no , she has been allotted to us , " put in an officer belonging to still another command .
" how many men <name> she hold ? "
questioned a captain of the rough riders .
" about a thousand . "
" then she ca n't take the three commands . "
<name> <name> overheard this talk , and at once made up his mind that it would be a question of what command got aboard of the transport first .
without the loss of a moment he ran back to where his men were in waiting .
" double-quick to the dock ! "
was his order .
and forming quickly , the troops made their way to the wharf with all possible speed .
in the meantime , colonel wood had gone out to the transport in a <unk> and gotten the vessel to come up to the wharf .
on board went the rough riders pell-mell , and not a minute too soon .
" this is our boat ! "
cried an officer , as he came up with his command a minute later .
" sorry for you , sir , but it is our boat , " was colonel wood 's firm answer .
then the third command loomed up , and a <unk> dispute arose .
but the rough riders remained aboard of the transport , taking four companies of another command in with them .
i have told of the particulars of this affair to show my young readers what was needed at this time , and how well <name> <name> performed his duties .
he had been a soldier and officer only a few weeks , yet he realized that army life on paper and army life in reality were two different things .
he felt that an officer must do much besides leading his men in the field : that he must look after them constantly , see that their health was provided for , see that they got their rations , see that transportation was ready when needed , and even see to it that some were kept away from the temptations of drink , and that they did not quarrel among themselves .
when going on board of the transport , the rough riders were supplied with twelve days ' rations each .
the most of the food was good , but the canned beef was very bad , just as it was found to be very bad in many other quarters , and it made a great number sick .
added to this , somebody had forgotten to issue salt to the soldiers ; so much had to be eaten without this very necessary <unk> .
" but we took matters good-naturedly , " said one of the number , in speaking of the trip that followed .
" many of the boys were out for a lark , and when they growled , they did it good-naturedly .
we had all sorts of men , and all sorts of nicknames .
an irishman was called <name> <name> , and a nice young jew old pork chop .
one fellow who was particularly slow was called speedy <name> , and another who always spoke in a quick , <unk> voice answered to the hail of <unk> <name> . '
one cowboy who was as rough as anybody in the command was christened the parson , and a fine , high-toned , well-educated college boy had to answer to the name of <name> the tramp .
some of the boys could sing , and they organized the rough rider <unk> ; and others could play , and they gave us music on the mouth <unk> and other instruments they had managed to smuggle along . "
the war department had expected to send the troops to cuba without delay , but now came in a report that some spanish war-ships were hovering around , ready to sink the transports as soon as they should show themselves , and for five days the vessels remained in port tampa harbor , until it was ascertained that the report was untrue .
those five days were important to <name> <name> and to the men under him .
every day the young officer spent a certain portion of his time in studying military tactics and in drilling his soldiers .
much had still to be learned , and the officers had their school of instructions as well as did those under them .
the weather was broiling hot , and some were already suffering from fever or its symptoms .
fortunately bathing was good , and many went in once or twice a day .
bathing in the ocean was great sport to some of the <unk> who had never seen anything larger than a river or creek , and they <unk> around like children , and got up races , with prizes for the best swimmers .
at last came the orders for the transports to set sail for cuba .
they numbered thirty-two in all , including a schooner which was towed along filled with drinking water , for water must be had , and that was the only place where it could be stowed .
to protect the transports from a possible attack by the enemy , they were accompanied by five war-ships at first , and later on by fourteen .
all told , there were on the transports eight hundred officers and sixteen thousand enlisted men .
of the commands , the most were from the regular army , the volunteers numbering but three  the rough riders , the <unk> new york infantry , and the second massachusetts infantry .
chapter xiv life on the transport  the landing at <unk>  the march to <unk>  the trail through the jungle  the skirmish at la <unk> while the army was preparing to invade cuba , matters so far as they concerned the navy had been moving along rapidly .
commodore <name> had sunk the spanish fleet in manila bay ; havana and the adjacent coasts were being <unk> , so no ships could pass in or out without running the risk of capture ; and a large fleet of war-ships under admiral cervera , of the enemy 's navy , had been " bottled up " in <name> harbor .
it had been decided that the united states troops should be landed on the southeast coast of cuba , not far from the entrance to <name> bay , and from that point should make an advance on <name> , which is the second city of importance in the island .
day after day the flotilla of transports kept on its way , spread out in a broad column during the time it was light , and coming in close together during the night .
the war-ships hovered near , and at night swept the ocean with their powerful <unk> , rendering a surprise by the enemy impossible .
the trip to the southeast coast of cuba lasted seven days .
it was very hot , even for this time of the year , and those who could , slept on deck during the voyage .
there was but little to do , and when not drilling , the men took it easy in the shade ,  sleeping , chatting , or playing games .
sometimes they would talk of the future and wonder how much of real fighting lay before them .
" we did n't know even then where we were going , " said one , in speaking of the trip .
" i do n't believe wood or <name> knew either .
first we thought it might be havana , then we imagined it might be porto <name> , but when we turned southward and ran around the eastern end of the island , we all knew we were bound for <name> . "
as the transports swept up toward the mouth of <name> bay , they came within sight of the american war-ships that were keeping admiral cervera 's fleet " bottled up " in the harbor .
a shout of recognition went up , and one of the bands struck up a patriotic air that was truly inspiring .
the landing of the rough riders and many other commands was made at <unk> , a small settlement on the coast east of <name> harbor .
the <unk> got closer to the shore than most of the other transports , and the men lost no time in <unk> , taking with them two <unk> automatic guns and a dynamite gun of which they had become possessed .
as there had not been transports enough , only the officers ' horses had been brought along .
these were thrown into the water and made to swim ashore .
<name> <name> had two horses , but one was drowned .
it was important that the landing should be guarded , and the war-ships sent in some shot and shell to dislodge any spaniards who might be in the vicinity .
but none showed themselves , and soon nearly all of the soldiers were ashore , either at <unk> or at a landing a short distance farther westward .
no enemy was in sight , and the only persons who appeared were some cubans , soldiers and civilians , who wanted but one thing , food .
the rough riders had been put into a brigade commanded by general <unk> .
young .
there were two of these brigades , and it is worth noting that they formed a division under the command of <unk> <name> wheeler , who had in years gone by fought so gallantly on the side of the confederacy .
now , as brave as of old , he was fighting for old <name> , the one banner of the north and the south alike .
as the rough riders landed , they were marched up the beach , and here they went into temporary camp ,  an easy matter , since each soldier carried his outfit with him , or , at least , as much as he could get of what belonged to him .
<name> <name> had his weapons and ammunition , a mackintosh and a <unk> , certainly much less than he had carried even when roughing it in the bad lands of the west .
as soon as the larger portion of the army was landed , general lawton  he who was afterward to give his life for his flag in the philippines  threw out a strong detachment on the <name> road to the westward , and also detachments on the roads to the north and east .
" on to <name> ! "
was the cry .
and many were for pushing forward without delay .
but the transports had still to unload their baggage , and word did not reach the rough riders to move on until the afternoon of the day after landing .
it was a <name> , uneven country , with much brushwood and jungles of trees and vines .
it had rained , but now the sun came out fiercely , and the rough riders ( riders in name only , for only the officers were on horseback ) suffered greatly through being clad in <name> uniform .
" it was a tough and tiresome march , " said one who was there .
" the air just quivered with heat , and many of the boys felt like throwing half of their clothing away .
whenever we reached a drinking place , the crowd would swarm around for water like a lot of bees .
" general lawton had his outposts pretty well advanced .
our commander , old general wheeler , was just as anxious to make a showing , and he ordered general young to push on with the rough riders and some other troops .
so away we went , with colonel wood at our head , and lieutenant-colonel <name> in command of one squadron and <name> <unk> in command of the other .
in some spots the road was frightful , full of <unk> , with big land crabs crawling around in all directions , and with the trailing vines full of poisonous spiders .
we did n't know but that the woods might be full of spaniards , and we were on the alert to give the dons as good as they sent , should they show themselves . "
by nightfall the rough riders reached the little village of <unk> without having met the enemy .
here they went into camp in the midst of a heavy thunder-storm in which every soldier and officer was drenched to the skin .
fires could scarcely be lighted , and it was not until the storm had partly cleared away that the cooks could prepare anything to eat .
surely being a soldier was not all <name> after all .
it had been learned that a portion of the spanish army was less than four miles away , and general young was ordered by general wheeler to move forward at daybreak and engage the enemy .
colonel wood received orders to move the rough riders by a trail over a hill , beyond which the country sloped toward the bay and the city of <name> .
the first encounter with the enemy occurred at a place called la <unk> ( or las <unk> ) , so called on account of trees of that name growing in the vicinity .
here the spaniards had <unk> and mounds of earth to shelter them and had likewise the <unk> of a plantation .
they had been watching for the coming of the <unk> eagerly , and were determined to give our soldiers a lesson not to be forgotten .
they knew that our army had not been in active warfare for years , and felt certain that they would soon be able to make the " paper " soldiers retreat .
the rough riders found the way led up a steep hill , and the pace was so fast that before the firing line was reached some men fell out from exhaustion .
<name> <name> was at the head of the first squadron and did his best to urge those under him forward .
there was an advance guard , led by some men under sergeant hamilton fish , and captain <unk> 's troop , and soon a crash of firearms notified all that a fight was on .
orders were at once issued to fill the magazines of the guns , and this was done .
then , while some troops moved to the left of the trail , lieutenant-colonel <name> was ordered to take three troops to the right .
here the jungle was heavy , and no sooner had the rough riders advanced than the spaniards opened fire upon them .
in speaking of the opening of this fight , mr. <name> himself writes :  " the effect of the <unk> powder ( used by the enemy ) was remarkable .
the air seemed full of the rustling sound of the mauser bullets , for the spaniards knew the trails by which we were advancing , and opened heavily on our position .
but they themselves were entirely invisible .
the jungle covered everything , and not the faintest trace of smoke was to be seen in any direction , to indicate from whence the bullets came . "
it was certainly a trying time  to stand up and be shot at without being able to return the compliment .
<name> and all the other leaders knew that this would not do , and at a great risk they continued to advance , until some spaniards were at last discovered across a valley to the right of where the troops under lieutenant-colonel <name> were located .
" there they are ! "
was the cry .
" forward and at 'em , boys !
down with the dons ! "
without delay some sharpshooters fired on the spaniards , and then the regular troops opened up , and at last the spaniards ran from cover .
bullets were now flying in all directions , and both sides were making their shots tell .
the americans had but scant protection , and it was not long before a number of them fell .
some bullets came close to <name> <name> , and one hit a palm tree near where he was standing , filling his left eye and ear with the dust and splinters .
had that mauser bullet come a few inches closer , the man who was destined to become the future president of our country might have been killed on the spot .
in the midst of the skirmish  for the conflict proved to be nothing more  there was a report that colonel wood was dead , and <name> <name> took it upon himself to restore the fighting line of rough riders to order .
but happily the report proved false ; and a little while after this the skirmish came to an end , and both spaniards and americans betook themselves to positions of greater safety .
in this skirmish , brief as it was , the rough riders lost eight men killed and nearly forty wounded .
chapter xv along the jungle trail  fording the river  opening of the battle of san <name> hill  bravery of the rough riders  personal experiences of <name> <name> during the battle taken as a whole , the skirmish at la <unk> was quite an important one , for it showed the spaniards that our soldiers were bound to advance upon <name> , be the cost what it might .
more than this , it showed that <name> <name> was brave under fire .
during the skirmish he paid but scant attention to his own personal safety .
he went wherever he thought he was needed , and the fact that mauser bullets were flying about in all directions did not <unk> him .
" he was about as cool a man as i ever saw in a fight , " said one old soldier .
" he did all he could to encourage the men , and had a kind word for every man he ran across who was wounded .
once , in the thickest of the brush , he grabbed up a gun and began to shoot with us , and i reckon he fired as straight as anybody there , for he had had lots of practice while hunting . "
the spaniards had been driven from their pits and from the <unk> of the plantation , and now took good care to keep out of sight .
<unk> were thrown out by the officers of the army , and those who had been in the fight took a <unk> rest , and looked after the dead and wounded .
there was certainly a touching scene at the temporary hospital , where one soldier started to sing " my country , 't is of thee , " and many others joined in .
on the following morning the dead were buried , the men gathering around the one common grave to sing " rock of ages " in a manner that brought tears to the eyes of many .
from la <unk> the rough riders moved to the bank of a small stream in the neighborhood .
part of the army was ahead of them and the rest behind , and for several days nothing unusual occurred .
but during that time general young caught the fever , whereupon colonel wood had to take charge of the brigade , and lieutenant-colonel <name> took command of the rough riders .
it was now the end of <name> , and the weather was anything but agreeable .
when the rain did not come down in torrents , the sun shone with a glare and a heat that was terrific .
as said before , the uniforms of the rough riders were heavy , and much clothing had to be cast aside as unfit for use .
to add to the discomfort , rations that were promised failed to appear , so that a good square meal was almost unknown .
" this <name> not do ; the men must have enough to eat , even if i have to buy it for them , " said acting colonel <name> , and made two trips down to the seacoast in search of beans , tomatoes , and other things to eat .
here he was informed that he could only buy stuff meant for the officers .
" all right ; i 'll buy the things for the officers , " he answered , and purchased as much as they would allow .
when he got back , he turned the food over to the officers , but saw to it that they gave their men a fair share .
" it was a kindness none of his men ever forgot , " said a soldier who was there .
" it was n't any of his business to buy the grub ,  the <unk> department had to supply it free ,  but he knew we might starve while the department was getting itself straightened out and ready to do the right thing .
before he went on a hunt for food , all we had was salt pork , <unk> , and coffee , and some of the stuff was n't fit to put in your mouth . "
and this testimony was the testimony of scores of others .
the spaniards were strongly intrenched upon the outskirts of <name> , and as it was a rough , hilly country , with many shallow streams and much jungle , it was hard for the american army to advance .
it was general <unk> 's idea to form a grand semicircle around <name> , starting from el <unk> on the north , and running in an irregular line to <unk> on the south .
throughout this territory the spaniards had done everything possible to hinder the advance of our troops .
barbed wire was strung in many directions , and often the brushwood would conceal dangerous pitfalls , so that any advance had to be made with great caution .
the attack upon the spanish lines began on july 1 , and the fighting took place in several quarters at once , but was unusually heavy at el <unk> and at san <name> hill .
at el <unk> the heroic general lawton was in command , and fought as gallantly as he afterward did in the philippines .
some of the charges were terrific , and <name> ever be remembered by those who participated in them .
the rough riders struck camp and moved along the trail on the last day of <name> .
it was as hot as ever , with no sign of rain .
the trail was filled with troops and provision wagons , and the progress , consequently , was slow .
" let us get into the fight ! "
was the cry heard on every side .
" don't keep us waiting any longer . "
" keep cool , " said one of the officers .
" you 'll get all the fighting you want soon . "
and so it proved .
at a little after eight o'clock in the evening the rough riders found themselves on el <unk> hill , and here the whole brigade to which they were attached went into camp .
" it was n't much of a camp , " said one who was there .
" we just threw out a strong <unk> and went to sleep on our arms , and glad of it , after that day in the broiling sun .
we had had to ford some pretty muddy streams , and all of us were water and mud up to our knees .
but everybody was as enthusiastic to fight as ever . "
at sunrise the battle opened at el <unk> , and the rough riders could hear the booming of cannon .
at once all was activity , and the men prepared to move ahead at a moment 's notice .
acting colonel <name> was with colonel wood at the time , and both were listening to the roar of the artillery .
" i wish we could move  " began colonel wood , when , of a sudden , both he and <name> <name> heard a strange humming sound in the air .
then came the explosion of a shrapnel shell over their heads , and both leaped to their feet .
" this is getting warm ! "
cried <name> <name> , and ran toward his horse , when boom !
came another explosion , and one of the bullets fell upon his wrist , making , as he himself says , " a bump about as big as a hickory nut . "
this same shell , he adds , wounded four of the men under him and two or three regulars , one of whom lost his leg .
certainly another providential escape on the part of the future president .
without loss of time <name> <name> ordered his troops into the underbrush , and here , for the time being , they were safe .
on account of the <unk> powder they used , the spanish batteries could not be precisely located , so our own artillery were at a slight disadvantage .
but now the blood of the americans was fully aroused , and soon came an order for a general advance ,  something that was hailed with wild delight by the rough riders .
" hurrah , now we 'll show 'em what the yankees can do ! "
was the cry .
" down with the dons !
three cheers for uncle <name> ! "
the rough riders had to ford the river , and while they were doing this , a balloon that had been used for observations came down in that vicinity and attracted the attention of the spanish sharpshooters .
the firing was now heavy on all sides , and many a gallant soldier went down to rise no more .
then came another wait of an hour , during which the rough riders rested in a hollow leading up from the river .
again there was grumbling .
with so much fighting on all sides , why could they not advance ?
" we 'll get our turn , " said <name> <name> .
and soon after a staff officer dashed up with orders to move forward and support the cavalry of the regular army on the hills in front .
" now to the front ! "
was the cry .
" down with the dons ! "
and away went troop after troop on the double-quick , with acting colonel <name> leading them .
shot and shell were hurling themselves through the air in all directions , and on all sides could be heard the shrieks and groans of the dead and the dying .
it was a time long to be remembered .
men went down in all directions , and with them not a few officers .
it was so hot that <name> 's orderly was prostrated from the heat and afterward died .
<name> summoned another rough rider , and had just finished giving the man some orders when the soldier pitched forward upon his commander , killed by a bullet through the throat .
as the troops advanced , <name> <name> urged his men forward and told them to do their best , to which they responded with a cheer .
he was on horseback at the time , and soon came across a man lying in the shade , probably overcome by the heat .
he started to speak to the rough rider when a bullet hit the fellow and killed him on the spot .
" i suppose that bullet was meant for me , " says mr. <name> , in writing of this incident .
" i , who was on horseback in the open , was unhurt , and the man lying flat on the ground in the cover beside me was killed . "
the fight had now centred around the possession of san <name> hill , upon which was located a spanish <unk> .
the bullets were flying as thickly as ever , when <name> was ordered to advance in support of another regiment .
as the rough riders reached the spot where the other regiment was , they found the men lying down awaiting orders .
" i am ordered to support your regiment , " said <name> <name> to the first captain he met .
" we are awaiting orders to advance , " answered the captain of the regulars .
" in my opinion we can not take these hills by firing at them , " returned the commander of the rough riders .
" we must rush them . "
" my orders are to keep my men where they are . "
" where is your colonel ? "
" i do n't know . "
" well , if he is n't here , then i am the ranking officer , and i give the order to charge , " came quickly and positively from <name> <name> .
" well , sir ,  i  i have orders from our colonel  " began the captain of the regulars .
" if you wo n't charge , let my men pass through , sir , " cut in the acting colonel of the rough riders , and he ordered his men to move to the front .
this was too much for the regulars , and up they sprang with shouts and yells , and rough riders and regulars went up san <name> hill together .
<name> was on horseback as before , but at a <unk> fence he leaped to the ground , swung his hat in the air , and joined his men on foot .
the fight was now at its <unk> , and men were being <unk> down in all directions .
but the fever of battle was in the veins of all the american soldiers , and nothing could stop them .
up the hill they went , loading and firing at random , and making as many shots as possible tell .
the spaniards were in retreat , and soon old <name> was planted in several places .
some of the leading officers had been shot , and <name> <name> found himself at one time in command of five regiments , and doing his best to keep them in military order .
strange as it may seem , with bullets flying all around him , he remained unharmed , saving for some slight scratches which , he tells us , " were of no consequence . "
with the top of the hill gained , the american soldiers could get a distant glimpse of <name> , several miles away , and some wanted to move still farther forward .
but the spaniards had strong intrenchments to fall back upon , and it was deemed best to " let well enough alone . "
accordingly the american line was made as strong as possible , and by nightfall the battle was at an end , and the rough riders were told to hold the hill and <unk> , and they did so .
in the <unk> they found some food belonging to some spanish officers , and upon this they feasted after their <unk> victory .
chapter xvi results of the fight  life in the trenches  the spanish fleet in <name> harbor  another great naval victory  the rough riders and the spanish <unk> the fight had been a hard and heavy one .
the rough riders had gone into the engagement just <unk> strong , and of that number 89 were killed or wounded .
the total loss to the americans was <unk> killed and wounded .
the loss to the spanish was also heavy , but the exact figures <name> probably never be known .
utterly tired out with their marching and fighting , the rough riders intrenched as best they could , cared for their wounded and dead , and then dropped down to get a <unk> rest .
the night was <name> and cold , and many who had been bathed in perspiration suffered accordingly .
<name> <name> had a blanket taken from the spanish , and in this he rolled himself , and slept with others of his command .
at three o'clock in the morning came an unexpected alarm .
the spanish <unk> were out in force , trying to drive the americans back .
but there was no heavy attack , and presently all became as quiet as before .
" they 'll not give up yet , " said one of the officers of the rough riders .
" they mean to <unk> this hill if they can . "
just at daybreak the spaniards opened the attack on san <name> hill once more .
<name> <name> was resting under a little tree when a shrapnel shell burst close by , killing or wounding five men of the command .
he at once ordered the eight troops under him to a safer position , where the spanish battery and the sharpshooters could not locate them so readily .
if the fight had been hard , guarding the trenches was almost equally so .
the sun beat down fiercely , and the newly turned up earth made many of the rough riders sick .
added to this , provisions were , as usual , slow in arriving .
those in the trenches were kept there six hours , and then relieved by the others who were farther to the rear .
" running from the cover of brush to the trenches was no easy matter , " says one rough rider who was there .
" we had dug the trenches in a hurry , and had no passages from the rear leading to them .
all we could do was to wait for a signal , and then rush , and when we did that , the spaniards would open a hot fire and keep it up for perhaps fifteen minutes .
the sun was enough to turn a man 's <name> , and more than one poor fellow caught a fever there that proved fatal to him . "
through the entire day the firing continued , but no advances were made upon either side .
the americans were waiting for reinforcements , and the spaniards were doing likewise .
on our side a dynamite gun and two <unk> guns were used , but with little success .
but the gatling guns proved very effective , and caused a great loss to the enemy .
the city of <name> lies on the northeast coast of a large bay of the same name .
this bay is shaped somewhat like a bottle , with a long neck joining it to the <unk> sea .
in the harbor , at the time of the battles just described , the spaniards had a fleet of war-ships under the command of admiral cervera , an old and able naval commander .
in the fleet were four large cruisers and two <unk> .
three of the cruisers were of seven thousand tons burden each , and all could make from eighteen to nineteen knots an hour .
each carried a crew of about five hundred men , and all were well supplied with guns and ammunition .
to keep this fleet " bottled up , " our own navy had a fleet of its own just outside of the harbor , where it had been stationed ever since admiral cervera had been discovered within .
the american fleet consisted of the cruiser brooklyn , which was commodore schley 's <unk> , the battleships texas , iowa , indiana , and oregon ( the latter having sailed all the way from the pacific coast around cape horn to get into the fight ) , and the converted yachts gloucester and vixen .
there were also close at hand , but not near enough to get into the fight , the cruiser new york , admiral sampson 's <unk> , and several other vessels of lesser importance .
for a long time it had been thought that cervera would try to escape from the harbor , in which he could not be reached because of the strong forts that protected the entrance .
to bottle him up more effectively , the americans tried to block up the harbor entrance by sinking an old iron steamboat , the merrimac , in the channel .
this heroic work was undertaken by lieutenant hobson with a crew of seven daring men , but the plan failed , for the merrimac , instead of sinking where intended , swung to one side of the main channel .
when it was reported to him that the americans had taken the heights of el <unk> and san <name> and were strongly intrenched in their positions , admiral cervera concluded that <name> bay might soon become too hot to hold him .
the capture of the city would be followed by the taking of the forts at the harbor entrance , and then there would be nothing left for him to do but to surrender .
san <name> and el <unk> had been taken on friday , and all day saturday occurred the shooting at long range , as already described .
in the meantime the war-ships outside of the harbor kept up a close watch on the harbor entrance , lying well out during the day , but coming in closer at night , and using their powerful <unk> from sundown to sunrise .
<name> dawned bright and clear , and for the time being all was quiet both ashore and afloat .
in the trenches the rough riders and other soldiers were still on guard , doing what they could for their wounded , and trying to get the rations which were still delayed .
presently , those on board of the american fleet noticed a thick cloud of smoke hanging over the harbor , coming from the funnels of the spanish war-ships .
then one of the enemy 's vessels showed itself , quickly followed by the others , and all turned westward , to escape up the coast .
" the enemy is escaping ! "
was the signal hoisted .
and then one cannon after another boomed out , giving the signal to all our ships in that vicinity .
the booming of the cannon was heard away eastward at <unk> , whither admiral sampson had gone with his ship to confer with general <unk> , and without delay the new york raced madly back to get into the fight that followed .
" remember the maine !  " was the cry .
" down with the spanish ships !
give 'em what <name> did ! "
and this cry , " give 'em what <name> did ! "
was heard on every hand .
the first vessel to go down was a torpedo-boat , sunk by the gloucester , and this was quickly followed by the sinking of the second torpedo-boat .
in the meantime the larger vessels were pouring in their rain of steel upon the spanish cruisers with deadly effect , knocking great holes into the ships and killing scores of those on board .
the spanish cruiser <name> was the first to succumb to the heavy attack , and soon she turned in to shore to save her crew from drowning .
then the <unk> caught fire in several places , and burning fiercely from stem to stern , she , too , turned in .
but two ships were now left to admiral cervera , the vizcaya and the colon , and each had suffered much .
both were doing their best to get out of reach of our guns and the marvellous accuracy of our gunners .
" do n't let 'em get away ! "
was the cry .
" give 'em what <name> did ! "
forward went the war-ships of uncle <name> , the powerful oregon leading , with the brooklyn and texas not far behind .
the rain of steel continued , and at last , burning like her sister ships , the vizcaya turned shoreward , and many of her crew leaped overboard to save their lives .
only the colon now remained .
she was still in fair condition , and it was the spaniards ' ardent <name> to save at least one ship from the dire calamity that had overtaken them .
but this was not to be , and after a run of a few miles , during which the oregon and brooklyn continued to pound her with shot and shell , the spanish flag was lowered , and the colon also ran ashore .
it was assuredly a mighty victory , a fitting mate to the great victory won by admiral <name> , and when the news reached our country there was such a fourth of july celebration everywhere as <name> never be forgotten .
twice had our navy met the ships of spain , and each time we had sunk every vessel without losing any of our own .
more than this , while the spaniards had lost many men through shot and fire and drowning , our total loss was but one man killed and a handful wounded .
the loss of her second fleet was a bitter blow to spain , and many predicted that the war would not continue much longer , and this prediction proved correct .
during the rush made by the rough riders and our other soldiers , they had gone right through several bodies of spanish <unk> who were secreted in the trees of the jungle .
these <unk> , really lawless fellows belonging to no particular command , could not get back into <name> because of the strong american guard at the intrenchments , and consequently they contented themselves with remaining out of sight and <unk> our soldiers whenever the opportunity offered .
" this <name> not do , " said <name> <name> .
" they are shooting down our men without giving them a chance to fire back .
we 'll have to get after them . "
and without delay he sent out a detachment of the best rough rider shots to be found .
these sharpshooters searched the jungle back of the intrenchments thoroughly , and as a result killed eleven of the <unk> and wounded many more .
after that the <unk> kept their distance , satisfied that the yankees could beat them at their own game .
chapter xvii devotion of the rough riders to <name> <name>  his kindness to his men  last of the fighting  the truce and treaty of peace with the defeat of admiral cervera 's fleet , a flag of truce was sent into <name> by the commander of our army , demanding the surrender of the city .
while these negotiations were pending , all fighting came to an end , and the rough riders had but little to do outside of making themselves comfortable and caring for the many who were getting sick because of the lack of shelter and proper food .
food was now coming in more rapidly , and soon all were supplied with tents and blankets .
during this time <name> <name> 's personal baggage appeared , and he celebrated the arrival by treating himself to a shave and a change of linen , something impossible to do since the fighting had begun .
in his own writings , mr. <name> has spoken at great length of the devotion which all of the rough riders displayed toward him .
they were anxious to wait on him at all hours of the day and night .
some would pitch his tent , others would clean his weapons , and still others would go hunting and bring in such game as the vicinity afforded .
when ordered to do anything , there was rarely a grumble .
those in the hospital bore their sufferings with remarkable fortitude .
in return for this , <name> <name> did all he could to make life less hard for those under him .
the game that was brought to him he sent to the hospital , that the wounded might have proper nourishment ; and he either went himself or sent somebody to the seacoast , to purchase food which the <unk> department possessed , but which , through lack of organization , it was slow in distributing .
when no shelter was to be had , he slept on the ground with his men , and when they had to work on the trenches at night , he was up and around superintending the labor .
" he was one of us , and he let us know it , " was said by one of the rough riders .
" he ate the same food we did , and he was mighty good to the sick and the wounded .
he paid for lots of things out of his own pocket , and i do n't believe he has ever asked uncle <name> to pay him back . "
there was no telling how soon the truce would come to an end and fighting would begin again , and night after night the rough riders were kept on guard .
there was a standing order that each fourth man should keep awake while the others slept , and no matter how dark or rainy the night , <name> <name> tramped around from one trench to another , seeing to it that this order was obeyed .
he also visited the intrenchments of other commands , to compare them and make certain that the grade of service was equally high among the rough riders .
this shows distinctly that he was a <unk> military commander .
the truce lasted a week , and while all operations were supposed to have come to an end , both the americans and the spaniards spent the time in strengthening their positions .
at one time the americans constructed a fairly good defence , in which they placed two gatling guns and two automatic colt guns , and this was named fort <name> , in honor of the rough rider commander .
on the tenth of july the fighting began once more , and again the batteries on both sides sent shot and shell into the camps of the enemy .
it was largely fighting at long range , and the only rough riders who took part were those who manned the colt 's guns , and a small body of sharpshooters stationed in a trench well to the front .
on the next day the rough riders were ordered northward , to guard the road running from <name> to el <unk> .
here some fighting was in progress , and the troopers expected to get into battle once more .
but the skirmish came to an end before they arrived , very much to their disappointment .
hardly had the rough riders settled in their new position than a storm came up which proved to be the heaviest yet experienced during the campaign .
while <name> <name> was sleeping in his tent , the shelter was blown down and away , and all of his personal effects were scattered in the mud and wet .
as best he could , he donned his clothing , saw to it that his men were safe , and then betook himself to a kitchen tent , where he finished the sleep of that night on a rude table recently taken from an abandoned spanish home in that vicinity .
" on that night it rained cats and dogs and <unk> , " said one of the soldiers afterward .
" it was inky dark  darker than i have ever known it to be anywhere on the plains .
the water made a muddy pond of the whole camp , and the trenches were half filled in no time .
everything was blown <unk> by the furious wind , and some of our outfits we never recovered .
in the midst of the confusion some fellows reported that the spaniards were trying to break through our lines , but the report was false ,  the outsiders were starving cubans who had come in looking for shelter and something to eat .
we gave them what we could  which was precious little , for we had next to nothing ourselves  and then got them to help us get things together again .
one of the cubans was an old man , who could speak a little english .
he said he had lost two daughters and three grandchildren by starvation since the war between spain and cuba had started .
he himself was little more than a skeleton . "
that <name> <name> was <unk> enough to look out for other soldiers besides those of his own command is proven by what took place on the day following the big storm .
next to the rough riders were located a regiment of illinois volunteers .
because of the muddy roads and swollen streams , they could get no rations , and scant as were their own supplies , colonel <name> had the rough riders furnish them with beans , coffee , and a few cases of <unk> , for which they were extremely grateful .
later in the day the commander of the rough riders also got to them part of a mule train of provisions .
the american position had been greatly strengthened , and many additional troops were now at the front .
it was felt that an advance upon <name> would surely result in victory , although the losses might be large .
but the spaniards were no longer in a position to continue the struggle , and on july 17 the city formally surrendered .
the surrendered territory covered many miles , and the spanish soldiers to lay down their arms numbered upward of twenty thousand .
there was great cheering in the american trenches when the glad news was brought in , and soon old <name> was planted on every height , while the trumpets sounded out triumphantly .
possession of <name> was immediate , and in a few hours the stars and stripes floated from the flagstaff of the civil government buildings .
our gallant army had won on the land just as our gallant navy had won on the sea .
the war had been , for us , one of triumph from start to finish .
in foreign countries the news was received with an astonishment that can scarcely be described .
after <name> 's wonderful victory in manila bay , many naval experts said that such a fight could not be duplicated , yet it was duplicated two months later off <name> bay in a manner that left no doubt of american supremacy on the sea .
then when it came to fighting on land , our army was designated as " paper " soldiers , that is , soldiers on paper or in name only , and it was said that their guns would be found of little use against the <unk> of spain .
but this was likewise false ; and to-day the army and navy of the united states are respected everywhere .
and more than this , foreign powers have come to our country for many of their war-ships , asking us to build and equip them , and also asking us to make cannon and rifles for them .
while the war was on in cuba , a part of the united states army under general miles was sent to porto <name> , another island belonging to spain .
here the inhabitants hailed the americans with delight , and the resistance by the spanish soldiers was only <unk> .
with the downfall of the navy and <name> , spain knew not what to do next , and gladly received the terms of peace offered by president <name> and his advisers .
the terms were accepted on <name> 9 , and thus the short but sharp war came to a termination .
by the treaty of peace cuba was given her <name> , and porto <name> and the philippines passed into the possession of the united states .
chapter xviii last days in cuba  the departure for home  arrival at <unk>  caring for the sick and wounded  presentation to <name> <name> by his men  <unk> of the rough riders four days after the surrender of <name> the rough riders found themselves in the hills four or five miles back from the intrenchments they had occupied during the last fight .
other commands were scattered in various directions , for to let them go into the wretched city would have been out of the question .
<name> was dirty in the extreme ; the fever was there , and hundreds were on the verge of starvation .
it was a trying time for everybody , and equally so for <name> <name> , who did all in his power , as before , to make his men comfortable .
when it did not rain , the sun came out fiercely , causing a rapid evaporation that was thoroughly exhausting to the soldiers .
the locality was not a healthy one , and soon scores of rough riders and others were down with <unk> or fever .
doctors and surgeons were scarce , and hospital accommodations were scanty , and again and again did colonel <name> send down on his own account to the seacoast and to <name> for food and medicines of which his command were in dire need .
he was now colonel of the rough riders in reality , his promotion having been granted to him just one week after the heroic charge up san <name> hill .
his old colonel , wood , was installed at <name> as military governor .
this , for the time being , left colonel <name> in command of the cavalry brigade , no small honor to one who had been , but a few months before , a stranger to military duties .
during this time in camp , <name> <name> visited <name> and the forts at the entrance to the harbor , and with the pen of a skilled author he has , in one of his books , given us vivid pictures of the sights to be seen there at that time  the crooked streets with their queer shops , the wretched inhabitants , the grim and frowning forts , all hemmed in by the towering mountains and the sea .
he likewise tells of his trips to the mountains , and how his companions were usually exhausted by the climbing done .
for one who in his youth had been so delicate , he stood the exposure remarkably well , for which he was thankful .
for some time the authorities at washington did not know what to do with the troops in cuba .
it was suggested that they move up to higher ground , or to another neighborhood .
but general <unk> knew , and so did all of the officers under him , that to keep the army in the island would only mean more sickness and death .
" i <name> go to the general with a protest , " said colonel <name> .
and he did so .
meanwhile the other head officers <name> up a letter of protest , and this was signed by all , including the commander of the rough riders .
in his own letter <name> protested against the treatment of his men in the matter of rations , clothing , and hospital accommodations , and in the other letter , called by the officers a round <name> , there was a protest about remaining in cuba longer , with the fever getting worse every day .
these letters were made public through the press of the united states , with the result that the troops were ordered home without further delay .
the rough riders left cuba on <name> 7 , just six weeks and a half after landing .
the time spent in the island had been short , but to many it seemed an age .
none were sorry to depart , although sad to think that some of the sick had to be left behind .
the transport used this time was the <unk> , and mr. <name> tells us that , taken as a whole , the accommodations were better than they had been on the <unk> .
but on the trip much trouble was had with some of the <unk> and engineers , who insisted upon drinking some liquor smuggled aboard .
" i <name> not permit this , " said colonel <name> .
and he read the disorderly ones a strong lecture and made them give up their liquor .
after that , as there was much grumbling , he set a guard ; and that was the end of that trouble .
the destination of the transport was <unk> , on the extreme eastern shore of long island .
the trip took nine days ,  rather a dreary time to those anxious to see their native land once more .
when an anchorage was gained , a gunboat came out to the transport with the welcome news that spain had agreed to our terms .
the sick had still to be cared for ; yet , taken as a whole , the month spent at the camp at <unk> was pleasant enough .
here colonel <name> met that part of the regiment that had been left behind in <name> , and all the stories of the fights had to be told over and over again .
" it was good to meet the rest of the regiment , " says mr. <name> , in his book .
" they all felt dreadfully at not having been in cuba .
of course those who stayed had done their duty precisely as did those who went . "
which was true ; yet , as he adds , those who had been left behind could not be comforted .
colonel <name> was still in charge of the brigade while at <unk> , and much of his time was taken up in getting out necessary reports , and seeing to it that the entire camp was kept in first-class sanitary condition .
" and he was up to the <name> , " said one of those who were there .
" he did n't allow the least bit of dirt , and everything had to be as <unk> as if we were at west point .
and it was a good thing , too , for it kept the sickness from spreading . "
the <unk> is strong at <unk> , and this soon began to tell upon all who were sick , putting in them new life and vigor .
here every possible attention was given to those who were down , so that ere long many were up again and as well as ever .
when he had a little time to himself , <name> <name> would gather a few friends around him , and either go to the beach to bathe or go off on a long horseback ride .
war was to him a thing of the past , and he was once more willing to become a private citizen as of old .
in those days the camp at <unk> was constantly crowded with visitors from new york city and elsewhere , who poured in upon every train .
all of the soldiers who had been to cuba were hailed as heroes , and had to tell their stories many times .
" every soldier had a crowd following him , " said one private .
" the visitors wanted to know how we had fought , how we had been treated by the government , how things looked in cuba , and a hundred and one other things .
most of the visitors , especially the ladies , wanted our autographs , and i had to write mine as many as forty times a day .
i remember one of the men , a cowboy from oklahoma , could n't write , and he got so upset over this that every time somebody asked him for his autograph he would run away , saying he had forgotten to do something that he had been ordered to do .
when i and some chums went down to new york to look around , all the folks stared at us , and many insisted on shaking hands and treating . "
[ illustration : colonel <name> at <unk> point .
( photograph by <unk> <unk> , new york. ) ] the uniforms the rough riders had worn in cuba were in rags , and many had boarded the transport barefooted .
the rags were saved as trophies of the occasion , and many are still in existence .
at camp <unk> , as the place was called , there was a large hospital for the sick , and to this many came to do what they could for the sufferers , who were now given every possible attention .
among the visitors was miss <name> gould , who had used her ample means for the benefit of the sick all through the war , and who now continued to play the good <unk> .
president <name> and many of his cabinet likewise visited the camp , and saw to it that everything in the hospital and out of it was as it should be .
the sick were presented with the best of fruits and other things , and many ladies assisted the nurses by reading to the patients and by writing letters for them .
now that they had nothing to do in the shape of fighting , many of the rough riders were anxious to get back to the wild west .
life in an ordinary camp did not suit them , and at every available opportunity they indulged in " horse play , " working off many practical jokes upon each other .
one day a report went the rounds that a member of another cavalry organization could not master a certain horse that had been assigned to him .
the report was true , for the horse was what is called by ranchmen a " bad <unk> . "
" i think sergeant <name> can master him , " said colonel <name> .
he referred to one of the best " bronco <unk> " among the rough riders , a man who had never yet allowed a steed to get the best of him .
" all right , let <name> try him , " said others .
and a test was arranged for the day following .
at that time secretary of war <unk> was in camp , and a great crowd of visitors , military men and others , gathered before colonel <unk> quarters to watch the contest .
at the proper time the vicious horse was brought forth , and watching his chance , sergeant <name> leaped upon his back .
then came such a <unk> , leaping , and prancing as many had never witnessed before .
" he 'll be killed ! "
cried many of the ladies .
" the horse <name> have him under in another moment . "
but such fears were groundless .
<name> knew exactly what he was doing , and in the end the fiery steed had to give in , completely conquered .
on the last <name> in camp , chaplain brown delivered an impressive sermon , to which all listened with grave attention .
after he had finished , <name> <name> spoke to the men in a feeling way .
" i told them how proud i was of them , " he says .
" but warned them not to think that they could go back and rest on their laurels , bidding them remember that though for ten days or so the world would be willing to treat them as heroes , yet after that time they would find they would have to get down to hard work just like anybody else , unless they were willing to be regarded as worthless <unk> . "
this was the best possible advice , and it is believed that many of the soldiers profited by it .
before the men were mustered out , they treated their beloved commander to a genuine surprise .
they had had a fine bronze of a " bronco <name> " made , and this was presented to colonel <name> on behalf of the whole regiment .
it touched him deeply , and to-day this bronze is one of his most highly prized gifts .
at last came news that the rough riders would be mustered out of the united states service the next day .
that evening a great celebration took place , in which all of the men joined , each according to his own notion of what a celebration should be .
large bonfires were lit , and here some delivered speeches , the soldiers from the colleges sang , those with indian blood in them gave a characteristic dance , and cowboys and ranchmen did " <unk> " and " cut up " as suited them .
on the morning of <name> 15 , four months after the rough riders had been organized , the colors were lowered in camp , the men were mustered out , and officers and privates shook hands and said good-by .
" it was the greatest sight i ever saw , " says one of the number .
" not until that moment came did we realize what it meant to part with those who had fought with us in battle and suffered the hardships of life in the trenches .
strange friendships had been formed , some between those who were very <name> and very poor , and others between those who were well educated and very ignorant .
one man who was studying for a professional life had as his particular chum a rough cowboy who had never spent six months over his books .
but the two had stood by each other and suffered , and i really believe they were willing to lay down their lives for each other .
" many of the men could hardly bear to part with colonel <name> .
he had stuck by them through thick and thin , and they worshipped him .
some shook hands half a dozen times , and some hardly dared to speak for fear of breaking down .
i never expect to see the match of that scene again . "
chapter xix nominated for governor of new york  a rough rider way of <unk>  elected governor  important work at albany  the homestead at oyster bay  chopping down a tree for exercise the war with spain was at an end , and uncle <name> had now to turn his attention to the philippines , where for many months to come military disturbances of a more or less serious nature were to take place .
<name> <name> might have remained in the army , and had he done so there is no doubt but that he would have swiftly risen to a rank of importance .
but the people of the state of new york willed otherwise .
" he is a great military man , " they said .
" but he was likewise a fine police commissioner and a civil service commissioner , fighting continually for what was right and good .
let us make him our next governor . "
the convention that nominated <name> <name> for the highest office in the empire state met at <unk> , <name> 27 , 1898 , just twelve days after the rough riders were mustered out .
at that time <name> s. black was governor of the state , having been elected two years before by a large majority .
the governor had many friends , and they said he deserved another term .
" <name> is not a citizen of this state , " said they .
" he gave up his residence here when he went to washington to become assistant secretary of the navy . "
" we do n't want him anyway , " said other politicians , who had not forgotten how the rough rider had acted when in the assembly .
" if he gets into office , it <name> be impossible to manage him . "
and they worked night and day to defeat the hero of san <name> hill .
on the day of the convention , the hall where it was held was jammed with people .
the people were also crowded in the street outside , and on every hand were seen rough rider badges .
" it was a <name> crowd from top to bottom , " says one who was there .
" you heard his name everywhere  in the hotels , on the streets , no matter where you went .
every once in a while somebody would shout , 'three cheers for <name> ! '
and the cheers would be given with a <name> . "
as soon as the convention had settled down to business , governor black was put up for nomination , and then the hon .
<name> m. <unk> presented the name of <name> <name> .
he spoke of what had been done in cuba , and added :  " the rough riders endured no hardships nor dangers which were not shared by their colonel .
he helped them dig their ditches ; he stood beside them in the deadly dampness of the trenches .
no floored tent for him if his comrades must sleep on the ground and under the sky .
in that <unk> charge of the rough riders up the hill of san <name> , their colonel was a hundred feet in advance . "
there was a prolonged cheering when <name> <name> 's name was mentioned , and hundreds waved their handkerchiefs and flags .
other speeches followed , and at last came the voting .
out of the total number cast <name> <name> received seven hundred and fifty-three and governor black two hundred and eighteen .
" i move we make the nomination of <name> <name> unanimous ! "
cried judge <unk> , who had previously presented the name of governor black .
and amid continued cheering this was done .
<name> <name> had been nominated on the regular republican ticket .
in opposition , the democrats nominated <name> van <unk> , also well known , and likewise of as old dutch stock as <name> himself .
the campaign was a decidedly strenuous one .
the democrats made every effort to win , while on the other hand the republicans who had wanted governor black for another term did not give to mr. <name> the support promised when his nomination had been made unanimous .
" we shall be defeated , " said more than one friend to <name> .
" it seems a shame , but we can not arouse the party as it should be aroused . "
" i <name> see what i can do myself , " answered the former leader of the rough riders .
and he arranged to make a complete tour of the state , taking in almost every city and town of importance .
when some of the old campaign managers heard of this , they came to <name> in great alarm .
" you must n't do it , " they said .
" it <name> ruin you . "
" i <name> risk it , " was the answer of the candidate .
and forthwith he started on his tour , taking a handful of his rough rider friends with him .
it was a brilliant stroke on the part of <name> <name> , and it told tremendously in his favor .
wherever he went , the people turned out in large crowds to see him and to listen to what he or his rough rider companions had to say .
citizens by the hundred came up to shake him by the hand and wish him success .
parades were organized to do him honor , and at night there would be brilliant illuminations and fireworks .
" we have aroused the party , " said he , when the tour was at an end .
and so it proved .
although van <unk> was popular , <name> <name> was elected to the high office of governor by seventeen thousand plurality .
it was certainly a high position for such a young man to occupy .
he was barely forty years of age , yet as governor of new york he ruled twice as many people as did <name> washington when first president of the united states .
he entered on his new duties with as much zeal as he had displayed when organizing the rough riders , and in a few weeks had the reins of government well in hand .
it is said that while he was governor he was never surprised by those who opposed him .
when they wanted facts and figures he was able to produce them , and he never supported or <unk> a measure unless he was morally certain he was on the right side .
he was <unk> to the last degree , and what he said he meant .
during his term of office many measures of importance were considered , but in a work of this kind it is not necessary to go into details .
for several important offices he nominated men of his own selection , despite the protests of some older politicians , and these selections proved first-class .
during his term as governor , mr. <name> did a great work for many poor people in new york city , who worked in what are called " sweat shops , "  small , close quarters , not fit for working purposes , in which men , women , and children make clothing and other articles .
he enforced what was known as the factory law , and the owners of the " <unk> " had to seek larger and more sanitary quarters for their employees .
he also took a strong hand in reforming the administration of the canals , which had been <unk> and unfair .
but perhaps his greatest work was in behalf of a measure meant to make the great corporations of new york state pay their fair share of the general taxes .
in the past these corporations had had great rights conferred upon them , and they had paid little or nothing in return .
" this is unjust , " said governor <name> .
" they should pay their taxes just as the poorest citizen is compelled to pay his tax . "
when the corporations heard this , many of the men in control were furious , and they threatened the governor in all sorts of ways .
they would defeat him if he ever again came up for election , and defeat him so badly that he would never again be heard of .
" do as you please , gentlemen , " said the governor .
" i am here to do my duty , and i intend to do it . "
and he called an extra session of the legislature for that purpose .
it is said that much money was used by some corporations to defeat governor <name> 's <name> , but in the end a modified form of the <name> was passed .
since that time other bills along similar lines have become laws ; so that the great corporations have to pay millions of dollars which in the past they had escaped paying .
such measures are of immense benefit to the ordinary citizen , and for his share in this work <name> <name> deserves great credit .
it was while governor of new york that mr. <name> gave to the public his book entitled " the rough riders . "
it contains a history of that organization from his personal point of view , and makes the most fascinating kind of reading from beginning to end .
it was well received , and added not a little to the laurels of the writer as an author .
although much of his time was spent at albany as executive , <name> <name> had not given up the old homestead at oyster bay on long island , and thither he went for rest and recreation , taking his entire family , which , as has been said , consisted of his wife and six children , with him .
the old <name> homestead is on a hill about three miles distant from the village .
the road to the house winds upward through a wilderness of trees and brushwood .
at the top of the hill , where the house stands , is a cleared space , free to the strong breezes of long island sound .
it is on the north shore , about twenty-five miles from city hall , new york .
the house is a large , <unk> affair , with crossed <unk> , and a large semicircular veranda at one end .
inside there is a wide hall , and all the rooms are of good size , with broad windows and inviting open <unk> .
one room is fitted up as mr. <name> 's " den , " with many <unk> filled with books , and with rare prints of washington , <name> , and other <unk> on the walls , and with not a few trophies of the hunt added .
in this room mr. <name> has done much of his work as an author .
it is said that <name> <name> not only chopped wood for a living , but that he rather enjoyed the outdoor exercise .
be that as it may , it remains a fact that mr. <name> frequently goes forth into the woods on his estate to fell a tree , or split one up , just for the exercise thus afforded .
this he did while he was governor of new york , and once astonished some newspaper men who had come to see him on business by the dexterity with which he cut a large tree trunk in two .
he even invited his visitors to " take a hack at it " themselves , but they respectfully declined .
he still kept up his athletic exercise , and one of his favorite amusements was to go on long horseback rides , either alone , or with some relative or friend .
at other times he would go deep into the woods with his young sons , showing them how to bring down the nuts from the trees , or how to use their guns on any small game that chanced to show itself .
his family life was then , as it has always been , a happy one ; but of this let us speak later .

( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] chapter xx great reception to admiral <name>  governor <name> 's increased popularity  last annual message as governor  visit to chicago  remarkable speech on the strenuous life although the war with spain was over , the people of the united states had not forgotten the wonderful work accomplished by admiral <name> and his men at manila , and when the dauntless naval fighter returned to this country , people everywhere arose to do him honor .
" he well deserves it , " said governor <name> .
and he appointed <name> 29 and 30 , 1899 , as public holidays , to be observed throughout the entire state as days of general thanksgiving .
these days were commonly called " <name> days . "
the reception to the admiral and to the other naval heroes was to take place in new york and vicinity , and for many days the citizens were busy decorating their homes and places of business with flags and bunting and pictures , and immense signs of " welcome , " some in letters several feet long .
at the junction of broadway , fifth avenue , and twenty-third street , an immense triumphal arch was erected , and reviewing stands stretched along the line of parade for many miles .
on the day before the grand reception , governor <name> , with some members of his staff , called upon admiral <name> on board of the <name> , and offered the state 's greeting .
a pleasant time was had by all , and the governor assured the sea hero that the people of new york and vicinity were more than anxious to do him honor .
it had been arranged that a naval parade should be held on the first day of the reception , and a land parade on the day following .
the course of the naval parade was up the hudson river past <name> 's tomb , and the grand procession on the water included the <name> , the <unk> <unk> , and the new york , indiana , massachusetts , texas , brooklyn , and a large number of other war-ships of lesser importance , besides an immense number of private <unk> and other craft .
the day dawned clear and bright , and the banks of the hudson were lined from end to end with people .
when the procession of war-ships swept up the stream , loud was the applause , while flags waved everywhere , and whistles blew constantly .
when passing <name> 's tomb every war-ship fired a salute , and the mass of sound echoing across the water was positively deafening .
as the <name> swept up the river , fired her salute , and then came to anchor a short distance below the last resting-place of general <name> , admiral <name> stood on the bridge of his <unk> , a small , trim figure , with a smile and a wave of the hand for everybody .
the surging people could see him but indistinctly , yet there was much hand clapping , and throats grew sore with cheering .
but there was another figure in that naval parade , the person of one also dear to the hearts of the people .
it was the figure of <name> <name> , dressed , not as a rough rider , but as a civilian , standing at the rail of a steamer used by the new york state officials .
when the people saw and recognized that figure , the cheering was as wild as ever .
" it is <name> ! "
ran from mouth to mouth .
" the hero of san <name> hill ! "
" hurrah for the rough riders and their gallant leader ! "
came from others .
and the cheering was renewed .
in the evening there was a grand display of fireworks and illuminated floats .
the immense span of the brooklyn bridge was a mass of lights , and contained the words " welcome , <name> " in <unk> which covered several hundred feet .
all of the war-ships had their <unk> in operation , and it can truthfully be said that for once the metropolis was as light as day .
but all of this was as nothing compared with the land parade which followed .
never before had the streets of new york been so jammed with people .
at many points it was impossible to move , yet the crowds were good-natured and patriotic to the core .
the parade started at <unk> tomb and ended at washington square , and was between five and six hours in passing .
admiral <name> rode in a carriage with mayor van <unk> , and received another ovation .
at the triumphal arch the admiral reviewed the parade , and here he was accorded additional honors .
in this parade governor <name> rode on horseback , in civilian dress .
as he came down the street , the immense crowds recognized him from afar , and the hand clapping and cheering was tremendous , and lasted long after he was out of sight .
" it 's our own <name> <name> ! "
cried the more enthusiastic .
" hurrah for the governor !
hurrah for the colonel of the rough riders ! "
" hurrah for the coming president ! "
said another .
and he spoke better than he knew .
this demonstration came straight from the people 's heart , and it could not help but affect <name> <name> .
sitting astride of his <unk> horse like a veteran , he bowed right and left .
next to <name> , he was easily the greatest figure in the parade .
on <name> 3 , 1900 , governor <name> sent his last annual message to the state legislature .
it was an able document , and as it was now recognized everywhere that he was a truly national figure , it was given careful attention .
it treated of the corruption in canal management , of the franchise tax , of taxation in general , and a large portion was devoted to the trusts .
at that time the trusts were receiving great attention everywhere , and it was felt that what the governor had to say about them , that they were largely <unk> , that they <unk> the condition of their affairs , that they promoted unfair competition , and that they wielded increased power over the <unk> , was strictly true .
in chicago there is a wealthy organization known as the hamilton club , and the members were very anxious to have governor <name> as their guest on <unk> day , <name> 10 , 1899 .
a delegation went to new york to invite the governor , and he accepted the invitation with pleasure .
" the middle west is very dear to me , " said he .
" it <name> be a pleasure to meet my many friends there . "
of course he was expected to speak , and said the subject of his address would be " the strenuous life , "  certainly a subject close to his own heart , considering the life he himself had led .
when mr. <name> reached the metropolis of the great lakes , he found a large crowd waiting at the railroad station to receive him .
the reception committee was on hand , with the necessary coaches , and people were crowded everywhere , anxious to catch a sight of the man who had made himself famous by the advance up san <name> hill .
but for the moment governor <name> did not see the reception committee , nor did he see the great mass of people .
in a far corner of the platform he caught sight of six men , dressed in the faded and tattered uniform of the rough riders .
they were not men of wealth or position , but they were men of his old command , and he had not forgotten them .
" glad to see you , boys , glad to see you ! "
he shouted , as he <unk> his way toward them .
" come up here and shake hands . "
" glad to see you , colonel , " was the ready answer , and the faces of the men broke into broad smiles .
they shook hands readily , and willingly answered all of the questions the governor put to them .
he asked how each of them was doing , calling them by their names , and concluded by requesting them to come up to the <unk> later , " for an <unk> chat . "
" it was a great meeting , " said one who was there .
" before the train came in , those old rough riders were nervous and showed it .
they knew that <name> had become a great man , and they were just a little afraid he would pass them by .
when the meeting was over , they went off as happy as a lot of children , and one of them said , 'say , fellows , <name> 's just all right yet , ai n't he ? '
and another answered : <unk> you he would be .
he's a white man through and through , none whiter anywhere . ' "
the banquet was held in the <unk> theatre building , and was said to be the largest ever given in chicago .
many distinguished guests were present , both from the north and the south , and the place was a mass of flowers and brilliantly illuminated , while a fine orchestra discoursed music during the meal .
when <name> <name> arose to speak , there was cheering that lasted fully a quarter of an hour .
the speech made upon this occasion is one not likely to be forgotten .
previous to that time the word " strenuous " had been heard but seldom , but ever since it has stood for something definite , and is much in use .
in part mr. <name> spoke as follows :  " i wish to preach , not the doctrine of ignoble ease , but the doctrine of the strenuous life ; the life of toil and effort ; of labor and strife ; to preach that highest form of success which comes , not to the man who desires mere easy peace , but to the man who does not shirk from danger , from hardship , or from bitter toil , and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph . "
another paragraph is equally interesting and elevating :  " we do not admire the man of timid peace .
we admire the man who <unk> victorious effort ; the man who never wrongs his neighbor , who is prompt to help a friend ; but who has those <unk> qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life .
it is hard to fail ; but it is worse never to have tried to succeed . "
and to this he adds :  " as it is with the individual so it is with the nation .
it is a base untruth to say that happy is the nation that has no history .
thrice happy is the nation that has a glorious history .
far better is it to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs , even though checkered by failure , than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much , because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat .

[ illustration : <name> <name> ] chapter xxi the convention at philadelphia  <name> <name> seconds the nomination of president <name>  becomes candidate for the <unk>  remarkable tours through many states as the time came on to nominate parties for the office of president and vice-president of the united states , in 1900 , there was considerable speculation in the republican party regarding who should be chosen for the second name on the ticket .
it was felt by everybody that president <name> had honestly earned a second term , not alone by his management of the war with spain , but also because of his stand touching the rebellion in the philippines , and on other matters of equal importance .
about the <unk> the political managers were not so sure , and they mentioned several names .
but in the hearts of the people there was but one name , and that was <name> <name> .
" we must have him , " was heard upon every side .
" he <name> be just the right man in the right place .
he <name> give to the office an importance never before attached to it , and an importance which it deserves . "
personally , governor <name> did not wish this added honor .
as the executive of the greatest state in our union , he had started great reforms , and he wanted to finish them .
" my work is here , " he said to many .
" let me do what i have been called to do , and then i <name> again be at the service of the whole nation once more . "
the national republican convention met in philadelphia , <name> 19 , in exposition hall , beautifully decorated with flags and banners .
senator <name> <name> , president <name> 's warmest personal friend , was chairman , and the delegates , numbering over seven hundred , came , as usual at such conventions , from every state in the union .
governor <name> himself was a delegate , and sat near the middle aisle , five or six seats from the front .
he was recognized by everybody , and it is safe to say that he was the most conspicuous figure at the convention .
up to the last minute many of the political leaders were , in a measure , afraid of <name> <name> .
they understood his immense popularity , and were afraid that the convention might be " <unk> " in his favor .
" if they once start to yell for <name> , it <name> be good-by to everybody else , " said one old politician .
" they are just crazy after the leader of the rough riders . "
but this man did not understand the stern moral honesty of the man under consideration .
<name> believed in <unk> <name> <name> , and had said so , and it was no more possible for him to seek the presidential nomination by an underhanded trick than it was for president <name> to do an equally base thing when he was asked to allow his name to be mentioned at the time he had pledged himself to support <name> <name> .
[ 2 ] both men were of equal loyalty , and the word of each was as good as his bond .
[ footnote 2 : see " american boys ' life of <name> <name> , " p .
191 . ]
it was senator <unk> who put up president <name> for nomination , and the vigorous cheering at that time <name> never be forgotten .
fifteen thousand throats yelled themselves hoarse , and then broke into the ringing words and music of " the union forever ! "
in a manner that made the very convention hall tremble .
then came cries for <name> , " for our own <name> of the rough riders ! "
and , written speech in hand , he arose amid that vast multitude to second the <unk> of <name> <name> .
not once did he look at the paper he held in his hand , but with a force that could not be misunderstood he addressed the assemblage .
" i rise to second the nomination of <name> <name> , because with him as a leader this people has trod the path of national greatness and prosperity with the strides of a giant , " said he , " and because under him we can and <name> succeed in the election .
exactly as in the past we have remedied the evils which we undertook to remedy , so now when we say that a wrong shall be righted , it most assuredly <name> be righted .
" we stand on the threshold of a new century , a century big with the fate of the great nations of the earth .
it rests with us to decide now whether in the opening years of that century we shall march forward to fresh triumphs , or whether at the outset we shall deliberately cripple ourselves for the contest . "
his speech was the signal for another burst of applause , and when finally <name> <name> was named as the candidate for vice-president , the crowd yelled until it could yell no longer , while many sang " yankee <unk> " and other more or less patriotic airs , keeping time with canes and <unk> .
when the vote was cast , only one delegate failed to vote for <name> <name> , and that was <name> <name> himself .
the platform of the party was largely a repetition of the platform of four years before .
again the cry was for " sound money , " and for the continuance of president <name> 's policy in the philippines .
the campaign which followed was truly a strenuous one  to use a favorite word of the candidate .
president <name> decided not to make many speeches , and thus the hard work previous to election day fell upon <name> <name> .
he did not shirk the task .
as with everything he undertook , he entered into the campaign with vigor , resolved to deserve success even if he did not win it .
" i <name> do my best in the interests of our party , and for the benefit of the people at large , " said <name> <name> .
" no man can do more than that . "
in the few short months between the time when he was nominated and when the election was held , governor <name> travelled over 20,000 miles by rail , visiting nearly 600 towns , and addressing , on a rough estimate , fully <unk> of people !
in that time he delivered <unk> speeches , some of them half an hour and some an hour in length .
in his thousands of miles of travel the candidate for the <unk> visited many states , particularly those lying between new york and colorado .
at nearly every town he was greeted by an immense crowd , all anxious to do the leader of the rough riders honor .
in the large cities great banquets were held , and he was shown much respect and consideration .
in many places those who had fought under him came to see and listen to him , and these meetings were of especial pleasure .
often he would see an old rough rider hanging back in the crowd , and would call him to the front or do his best to reach the <unk> and shake him by the hand .
one occurrence is worthy of special mention .
the democratic party had nominated <name> <unk> <name> as their candidate for president .
there was a great labor picnic and demonstration at chicago , and both governor <name> and mr. <name> were invited to speak .
" you had better not accept , governor , " said some friends to <name> <name> .
" there may be trouble . "
" i am not afraid , " answered the former leader of the rough riders .
" but mr. <name> and yourself are to be there at practically the same time . "
" that does not matter , " said the governor .
and he went to chicago on <name> 3 , to attend the labor day celebrations .
the picnic was held at electric park , and in the presence of fifteen thousand people governor <name> and mr. <name> " buried the hatchet " for the time being , and spoke to those surrounding them on the dignity of labor and the duties of the laboring man to better himself and his social conditions .
in that motley collection of people there were frequent cries of " hurrah for <name> ! "
and " what 's the matter with <name> ?
he 's all right ! "
but there was no disturbance , and each speaker was listened to with respectful attention from start to finish .
it was without a doubt a meeting to show true american <name> and free speech at its best .
but all of the stops on his tours were not so pleasant to governor <name> .
in every community there are those who are <unk> and bound to make an exhibition of their baseness .
at <unk> , new york , a stone was flung at him through the car window , breaking the glass but missing the candidate for whom it was intended .
at once there was excitement .
" are you hurt , governor ? "
was the question asked .
" no , " returned <name> <name> .
and then he added , with a faint smile , " it 's only a bouquet , but i wish , after this , they would n't make them quite so hard . "
there was also a demonstration against the candidate at <unk> , new york , which threatened for a while to break up an intended meeting .
but the worst <unk> was encountered at <name> , a small town in colorado , near the well-known mining centre of cripple creek .
<name> was full of miners who wanted not " sound money , " but " free silver , " for free silver , so styled , meant a great booming of silver mining .
" we do n't want him here , " said these miners .
" we have heard enough about him and his gold standard .
he had better keep away , or he 'll regret it . "
when <name> <name> was told he might have trouble in the mining camps , he merely shrugged his shoulders .
" i know these men , " he said .
" the most of them are as honest and respectable as the citizens of new york .
i am not afraid of the vicious element .
the better class are bound to see fair play . "
the governor spoke at a place called <unk> hall , and the <unk> was packed .
he had just begun his speech when there was a wild yelling and <unk> , all calculated to drown him out .
he waited for a minute , and then , as the noise subsided , tried to go on once more , when a voice cried out :  " what about rotten beef ? "
referring to the beef furnished during the <name> campaign , which had , of course , come through a republican <unk> department .
" i ate that beef , " answered the governor , quickly .
and then he added to the fellow who had thus questioned him : " you <name> never get near enough to be hit with a bullet , or within five miles of it . "
at this many burst into applause , and the man , who was a coward at heart , sneaked from the hall in a hurry .
he was no soldier and had never suffered the hardships of any campaign , and many hooted him as he deserved .
but the trouble was not yet over .
<name> <name> finished his address , and then started to leave the hall in company with a number of his friends .
on the way to the train a crowd of rowdies followed the candidate 's party , and threw all sorts of things at them .
one man made a personal attack on the governor and hit him on the chest with a stick .
he tried to leap away , but was knocked down by a personal friend of <name> <name> .
" down with the gold bugs ! "
was the cry , and the violence of the mob increased .
the friends of governor <name> rallied to his support , and blows were given and taken freely .
but with it all the candidate reached his train in safety , and in a few minutes more had left the town far behind .
he was not much disturbed , and the very next day went on with his <unk> as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened .
the better classes of citizens of <name> were much disturbed over the happening , and they sent many regrets to governor <name> , assuring him that such a demonstration would never again be permitted to occur .
chapter xxii elected vice-president of the united states  <unk> over the senate  tax upon <name> <name> 's strength  start on another grand hunting tour but the campaign , sharp and bitter as it had been , was not yet at an end .
in new york city there followed a " sound money parade , " which was perhaps the largest of its kind ever witnessed in the united states .
it was composed of all sorts and conditions of men , from bankers and brokers of wall street to the humble factory and mill hands from up the river and beyond .
the parade took several hours to pass , and was witnessed by crowds almost as great as had witnessed the <name> demonstration .
in new york city , as the time <name> closer for the election , there was every intimation that the contest would be an unusually " hot " one , and that there would be much <unk> and corruption .
it was said by some that police methods were very lax at that time , and that the saloons , which ought to be closed on election day , would be almost if not quite wide open .
[ illustration : photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> president <name> and vice-president <name> . ]
" we must have an honest election , " said governor <name> .
and without loss of time he sent letters to mayor van <unk> , and to the sheriff and the district attorney of the county of new york , calling their attention to the facts in the case , and telling them that he would hold them strictly responsible if they did not do their full duty .
as a consequence the election was far more orderly than it might otherwise have been in the metropolitan district .
the results of the long contest were speedily known .
<name> and <name> had been elected by a large plurality , and both they and their numerous friends and supporters were correspondingly happy .
great parades were had in their honor , and it was predicted , and rightly , that the prosperity which our country had enjoyed for several years in the past would continue for many years to come .
during those days the united states had but one outside difficulty , which was in <name> .
there a certain set of people called the <unk> arose in rebellion and threatened the lives of all foreigners , including american citizens .
an international army was organized , including american , english , french , <name> , japanese , and other troops , and a quick attack was made upon <unk> and pekin , and the suffering foreigners in <name> were rescued .
in this campaign the american soldiers did their full share of the work and added fresh laurels to the name of old <name> .
the tax upon the strength of the newly elected vice-president had been very great , and he was glad to surrender the duties of governor into the hands of his successor .
but as vice-president , <name> <name> became the presiding officer of the united states senate , a position of equal if not greater importance .
as president of the senate it is said that mr. <name> was kind yet firm , and ever on the alert to see that affairs ran smoothly .
he occupied the position only for one short <name> session , and during that time nothing came under discussion that was of prime importance , although my young readers must remember that all the work accomplished in our senate is of more or less magnitude .
" he was very <name> in his work , " says one who was in the senate at that time .
" as was his usual habit , he took little for granted , but usually started to investigate for himself .
he knew the rules thoroughly , and rarely made an error . "
for a long time the newly elected vice-president had been wanting to get back to his favorite recreation , hunting .
despite the excitement of political life , he could not overcome his fondness for his rifle and the wilderness .
he felt that an outing would do his system much good , and accordingly arranged for a five weeks ' hunting trip in northwestern colorado .
in this trip , which he has himself described in one of his admirable hunting papers , he had with him two companions , dr. <name> webb of colorado springs , and mr. <name> k. <name> , an old friend who in former years had been captain of the yale <unk> team .
the party went as far as the railroad would <name> them , and then started for a settlement called meeker , forty miles distant .
the weather was extremely cold , with the thermometer from ten to twenty degrees below zero , but the journey to meeker was made in safety , and here the hunters met their guide , a well-known <name> of that region named <unk> , and started with him for his ranch , several miles away .
<name> <name> would have liked to bring down a bear on this trip , but the <unk> were all in <name> quarters and sleeping soundly , so the hunt was confined to <unk> and <unk> .
the hunting began early , for on the way to the ranch the hounds <unk> a <unk> , commonly known as a lynx , which was secured without much trouble , and a second <unk> was secured the next day .
the territory surrounding <unk> 's ranch , called the <unk> , was an ideal one for hunting , with clumps of cottonwoods and pines scattered here and there , and numerous cliffs and ravines , the hiding-places of game <unk> .
the ranch home stood at the foot of several <unk> hills , a long , low , <unk> affair , built of rough logs , but clean and comfortable within .
the two days ' ride in the <unk> air had been a severe test of endurance , and all were glad , when the ranch was reached , to " thaw out " before the roaring fire , and sit down to the hot and hearty meal that had been prepared in anticipation of their coming .
the hunters had some excellent hounds , trained especially for <unk> and <unk> , animals that were never allowed to go after small game under any circumstances .
<name> <name> was much taken with them from the start , and soon got to know each by name .
" in cougar hunting the success of the <name> depends absolutely upon his hounds , " says mr. <name> .
and he described each hound with great minuteness , showing that he allowed little to escape his trained eye while on this tour .
on the day after the arrival at the ranch the party went out for its first cougar , which , as my young readers perhaps know , is an animal inhabiting certain wild parts of our west and southwest .
the beast grows to a size of from six to nine feet in length , and weighs several hundred pounds .
it is variously known as a puma and panther , the latter name sometimes being changed to " painter . "
when attacked , it is <unk> exceedingly savage , and on certain occasions has been known to kill a man .
in colorado the cougar is hunted almost exclusively with the aid of hounds , and this was the method adopted on the present occasion .
with the pen of a true sportsman , mr. <name> tells us how the hounds were held back until a cougar trail less than thirty-six hours old was struck .
then off went the pack along the cliffs and ravines , with the hunters following on horseback .
the trail led up the mountain side and then across the valley opposite , and soon the hounds were out of sight .
leading their steeds , the hunters went down the valley and followed the dogs , to find they had separated among the bare spots beyond .
but soon came a welcome sound .
" the cougar 's <unk> , " announced the guide .
and so it proved .
but when the hunters came closer , the cougar , an old female , leaped from the tree , <unk> the dogs , and leaped into another tree .
then , as the party again came up , the beast took another leap and started to run once more .
but now the hounds were too quick , and in a trice they had the cougar surrounded .
slipping in , <name> <name> ended the struggles of the wild beast by a <unk> behind the shoulder .
the next day there was another hunt , and this had rather a tinge of sadness to it .
the dogs tracked a mother cougar , who occupied her den with her three kittens .
the hounds rushed into the hole , barking furiously , and presently one came out with a dead kitten in his mouth .
" i had supposed a cougar would defend her young to the last , " says mr. <name> , " but such was not the case in this instance .
for some minutes she kept the dogs at bay , but gradually gave ground , leaving her three kittens . "
the dogs killed the kittens without loss of time , and then followed the cougar as she fled from the other end of her hole .
but the hounds were too quick for her , and soon had her on the ground .
<name> <name> rushed up , knife in one hand and rifle in the other .
with the firearm he struck the beast in the jaws , and then ended the struggle by a <unk> straight into the heart .
to many this may seem a cruel sport , and in a certain sense it assuredly is ; but my young readers must remember that <unk> and other wild beasts are a menace to civilization in the far west , and they have been shot down and killed at every available opportunity .
more than this , as i have already mentioned , <name> <name> is more than a mere <name> <unk> in bloodshed .
he is a naturalist , and examines with care everything brought down and reports upon it , so that his hunting trips have added not a little to up-to-date natural history .
the skulls of the various animals killed on this trip were forwarded to the <unk> survey , department of agriculture , washington , and in return mr. <name> received a letter , part of which stated :  " your series of skulls from colorado is incomparably the largest , most complete , and most valuable series ever brought together from any single locality , and <name> be of inestimable value in determining the amount of individual variation . "
chapter xxiii the <name> family in the adirondacks  the pan-american exposition at buffalo  shooting of president <name>  the <unk> visit  death of the president <name> <name> 's companions of the hunt remained with him for fourteen days , after which they departed , leaving him with <unk> , the ranchman and <name> already mentioned .
when the pair were alone , they visited <unk> mountain , said to be a great ground for <unk> and <unk> , and there hunted with great success .
all together the trip of five weeks ' hunting <unk> fourteen <unk> , the largest of which was eight feet in length and weighed 227 pounds .
mr. <name> also brought down five <unk> , showing that he was just as skilful with his rifle as ever .
the hero of san <name> hill fairly loved the outdoor exercise of the hunt , and spent three weeks in keen enjoyment after his companions had departed .
during this time it snowed heavily , so that the hunters were often compelled to remain indoors .
as luck would have it there were other ranches in that vicinity , with owners that were hospitable , so that they did not have to go into camp , as would otherwise have been the case .
on the last day of the hunt , <name> <name> was able to bring down the largest cougar yet encountered .
the hounds were on the trail of one beast when they came across that of another and took it up with but little warning .
" we 're going to get a big one now , " said <unk> .
" just you wait and see . "
" well , if we do , it <name> be a good ending to my outing , " responded <name> <name> .
the cougar was at last located by the hounds in a large <unk> on the side of a hill .
it had run a long distance and was evidently out of breath , but as the hunters <name> closer , it leaped to the ground and trotted away through the snow .
away went the hounds on the new trail of the beast .
" he 's game , and he 'll get away if he can , " said the guide .
at the top of another hill the cougar halted and one of the hounds leaped in , and was immediately sent sprawling by a savage blow of the wild animal 's paw .
then on went the cougar as before , the hounds barking wildly as they went in pursuit .
when <name> <name> came up once more , the cougar was in another <unk> tree , with the hounds in a semicircle on the ground below .
" now i think i 've got him , " whispered <name> <name> to his companion , and advanced on foot , with great <unk> .
at first he could see nothing , but at last made out the back and tail of the great beast , as it lay crouched among the branches .
with great care he took aim and fired , and the cougar fell to the ground , shot through the back .
at once the hounds rushed in and seized the game .
but the cougar was not yet dead , and snapping and snarling the beast slipped over the ground and down a hillside , with the dogs all around it .
<name> <name> came up behind , working his way through the brush with all speed .
then , watching his chance , he jumped in , hunting-knife in hand , and despatched the game .
" a good haul , " cried <unk> .
and later on he and his men came to the conclusion that it was the same cougar that had carried off a cow and a steer and killed a work horse belonging to one of the ranches near by .
the five weeks spent in the far west strengthened <name> <name> a great deal , and it was with renewed energy that he took up his duties as vice-president of our nation .
in the meantime , however , matters were not going on so well at home .
among the children two had been very sick , and in the summer it was suggested that some pure mountain air would do them a great deal of good .
" very well , we 'll go to the mountains , " said mr. <name> , and looked around to learn what place would be best to choose .
among the <unk> mountains of new york state there is a reservation of ninety-six thousand acres leased by what is called the <unk> club , a wealthy organization of people who have numerous summer cottages built within the preserve .
among the members was a mr. <unk> , an old friend of the <name> family , and he suggested that they occupy his cottage until the close of the season .
this invitation was accepted , and the whole <name> family moved up to the spot , which was located at the foot of mount <name> , the largest of the mountains in that vicinity .
here mr. <name> spent much time in hunting and fishing , and also in writing .
the family were not forgotten , and he frequently went out with the whole party , rowing and exploring .
sometimes they took baskets of lunch with them and had regular picnics in the woods , something the <name> children enjoyed very much .
in the meantime the pan-american exposition at buffalo , new york , had been opened , and day after day it was thronged with visitors .
vice-president <name> had assisted at the opening , and he was one of many who hoped the exposition would be a great success .
at the exposition our government had a large exhibit , and it was thought highly proper that president <name> should visit the ground in his official capacity and deliver an address .
preparations were accordingly made , and the address was delivered on <name> 5 to a most enthusiastic throng .
[ 3 ] [ footnote 3 : for this speech in full , and for what happened after it was delivered , see " american boys ' life of <name> . " ]
on the following day the president was driven to the <name> of music , on the exposition grounds , there to hold a public reception .
the crowds were as great as ever , but perfectly orderly , and filed in at one side of the building and out at the other , each person in turn being permitted to grasp the chief magistrate 's hand .
for a while all went well , and nobody noticed anything unusual about a somewhat <unk> individual who joined the crowd , and who had one hand covered with a handkerchief .
as this rascal came up to shake hands , he raised the hand with the handkerchief and , using a concealed pistol , fired two shots at president <name> .
for an instant everybody was dazed .
then followed a commotion , and while some went to the wounded executive 's assistance , others leaped upon the dastardly assassin and made him a prisoner .
there was an excellent hospital upon the exposition grounds , and to this president <name> was carried .
here it was found that both bullets had entered his body , one having struck the <unk> and the other having entered the abdomen .
the physicians present did all they possibly could for him , and then he was removed to the residence of mr. <unk> , the president of the exposition .
in the meantime , all unconscious of the awful happening that was to have such an influence upon his future , mr. <name> had been enjoying himself with his family , and helping to take care of the children that were not yet totally recovered from their illness .
all seemed to be progressing finely , and he had gone off on a little tour to vermont , to visit some points of interest and deliver a few addresses .
he was at isle la <unk> , not far from burlington , when the news reached him that president <name> had been shot .
he had just finished an address , and for the moment he could not believe the sad news .
" shot ! "
he said .
" how dreadful ! "
and could scarcely say another word .
he asked for the latest bulletin , and , forgetful of all else , took the first train he could get to buffalo , and then hastened to the side of his chief .
it was truly a sad meeting .
for many years these two men had known each other , and they were warm friends .
their methods were somewhat different , but each stood for what was just and right and true , and each was ready to give his country his best service , no matter what the cost .
it was a sad time for the whole nation , and men and women watched the <unk> eagerly , hoping and praying that president <name> might recover .
every hour there was some slight change , and people would talk it over in a whisper .
in a few days there were hopeful signs , and the physicians , deceived by them , said they thought the president would recover .
this was glad news to <name> <name> .
yet he lingered on , fearful to go away , lest the news should prove untrue and he should be needed .
but then there was a still brighter turn , and he thought of his own family , and of the fact that one of his children was again ill. " i <name> return to my family , " said he to two of his closest friends .
" but if i am needed here , let me know at once . "
and his friends promised to keep him informed .
two days later he was back among the adirondacks , in the bosom of his family .
the prayers of a whole nation were in vain .
<name> <name> 's mission on earth was finished , and one week after he was shot he breathed his last .
his wife came to bid him farewell , and so did his other relatives , and his friend of many years , <name> <name> , and the members of his cabinet .
" it is god 's way , " murmured the dying executive .
" his <name> be done , not ours . "
then like a child going to sleep , he relapsed into unconsciousness , from which he did not recover .
he died <name> 14 , 1901 , at a little after two o'clock in the morning .
it was the last of a truly great life .
illustrious men may come and go , but <name> <name> <name> be remembered so long as our nation endures .
as a soldier and a statesman he gave his best talents to better the conditions of his fellow-creatures , and to place the united states where we justly belong , among the truly great nations of the world .
chapter xxiv <name> <name> 's tramp up mount <name>  a message of importance  wild midnight ride through the mountains  on the special trains from north creek to buffalo with a somewhat lighter heart , <name> <name> returned to the adirondacks and joined his family on wednesday , three days previous to president <name> 's death .
the last report he had received from buffalo was the most encouraging of any , and he now felt almost certain that the president would survive the outrageous attack that had been made upon his person .
" he <name> get well , " said several who lived close by .
" you need not worry about his condition any longer . "
on the following day it was planned to go up to <name> lake , five miles from where the family was stopping .
some friends went along , and in the party were mrs. <name> and several of the children .
two guides accompanied them , and it was decided to spend the night at a camp on the lake , returning home the following day .
the next morning it rained , but in spite of this drawback <name> <name> , leaving the ladies and children to return to the cottage , started to climb mount <name> .
such an undertaking was exactly to his liking , and he went up the rough and uneven trail with the vigor of a trained <unk> , the guide leading the way and the other gentlemen of the party following .
at last , high up on the side of mount <name> , the party reached a small body of water known as tear of the clouds , and here they rested for lunch .
" you are certainly a great <name> , mr. <name> , " remarked one of the gentlemen during the progress of the lunch .
" oh , i have to be , " answered <name> <name> , <unk> .
" a vice-president needs exercise to keep him alive .
you see , when he is in the senate , all of his work is done sitting down . "
the words had scarcely been uttered when one of the party pointed to a man climbing up the mountain side toward them .
the newcomer held some yellow <unk> in his hand , and <name> <name> quickly arose to receive them .
he had soon mastered the contents of the messages .
president <name> was much worse ; it was likely that he would not live .
for fully a minute mr. <name> did not speak .
he realized the great responsibility which rested upon his shoulders .
then , in a voice filled with emotion , he read the messages aloud .
" gentlemen , " he continued , " i must return to the <unk> at once . "
and without waiting , he turned and started down the mountain side along the trail by which he had come .
it was a long , hard walk , but it is doubtful if <name> <name> took note of it .
a thousand thoughts must have flashed through his mind .
if <name> <name> should indeed breathe his last , the nation would look to him as their chief magistrate .
he could not make himself believe that his president was to die .
it was not long before <name> <name> reached the <unk> at the lake .
he asked for further news , but none was forthcoming .
" we <name> send to the lower <unk> at once , " said his friends .
" you had better take a short rest , in case you have a sudden call to make the trip to buffalo . "
a <name> rain was falling , and the atmosphere of the mountains was raw and penetrating .
messengers were quickly despatched to the lower <unk> , and by eleven o'clock that evening news came back that left no doubt of the true condition of affairs .
president <name> was sinking rapidly , and his death was now only a question of a few hours .
" i must go , and at once , " said <name> <name> .
and soon a light wagon drove up to the <unk> , and he leaped in .
there was a short good-by to his family and his friends , the whip cracked , and the drive of thirty-five miles to the nearest railroad station was begun .
it was a never-to-be-forgotten journey .
for ten miles or more the road was fearfully rough and ran around the edges of overhanging cliffs , where a false turn might mean death .
then at times the road went down into deep hollows and over <name> hills .
all was pitch black , save for the <name> yellow light hanging over the <unk> of the turnout .
crouched on the seat , mr. <name> urged the driver to go on , and go on they did , making better time during that rain and darkness than had before been made in broad daylight .
at last a place called <name> 's was reached , and <name> <name> alighted .
" what news have you for me ? "
he asked of a waiting messenger , and the latest message was handed to him .
there was no new <name> ,  president <name> was sinking faster than ever .
new horses were obtained , and the second part of the journey , from <name> 's to <unk> lair , was begun .
and during that wild , swift ride of nine miles , when it seemed to <name> <name> as if he were racing against death , the <name> of life everlasting claimed <name> <name> , and the man crouched in the wagon , wet from the rain , hurrying to reach him , became the next president of the united states .
it was a little after three in the morning when <unk> lair was reached .
the sufferer at buffalo had breathed his last , but <name> <name> did not know it , and he still hoped for the best .
more fresh horses , and now the last sixteen miles of the rough journey were made on a buckboard .
in spots the road was worse than it had previously been , and the driver was tempted to go slow .
" go on ! "
cried mr. <name> , and held his watch in hand .
" go on ! "
and the driver obeyed , the buckboard dancing up and down over the rocks and swinging dangerously from side to side around the curves of ravines .
but <name> <name> 's mind was not on the road nor on the peril of that ride , but in that room in buffalo where the great tragedy had just seen its completion .
at last , a little after five in the morning , the turnout came in sight of the railroad station at north creek .
a special train was in waiting for him .
he gazed anxiously at the little knot of people assembled .
their very faces told him the sorrowful truth .
president <name> was dead .
with bowed head he entered a private car of the special train , and without delay the train started on its journey southward for albany .
no time was lost on this portion of the trip , and at seven o'clock <name> <name> reached the city in which but a short time before he had presided as governor of the state .
at albany he was met by secretary of state hay , who informed him officially that president <name> was no more .
he likewise informed the vice-president that , considering the excitement , it might be best that mr. <name> be sworn in as president without delay .
another special train was in waiting at albany , and this was rushed westward with all possible speed , arriving in buffalo at half-past one in the afternoon .
in order to avoid the tremendous crowd at the union railroad station , mr. <name> alighted at the terrace station .
here he was met by several friends with a carriage and also a detachment of the fourth signal corps and a squad of mounted police .
without loss of time <name> <name> was driven to the <unk> house .
here he found a great many friends and relatives of the dead president assembled .
all were too shocked over what had occurred to say much , and shook the hand of the coming president in silence .
thousands of eyes were upon <name> <name> , but he noticed them not .
entering the <unk> house , he thought only of the one who had surrendered his life while doing his duty , and of that kind and patient woman now left to fight the battles of this world alone .
he offered what consolation he could to mrs. <name> , heard the little that had not yet been told of that final struggle to fight off death , and then took his departure , to assume the high office thus suddenly and unexpectedly thrust upon him .
chapter xxv takes the oath as president  the new chief magistrate at the funeral of president <name>  at the white house  how the first real working day was spent the new president took the oath of office at the residence of mr. <unk> <unk> in buffalo .
it is a fine , substantial mansion and has ever since been of historic interest to <unk> .
when he arrived at the <unk> home , he found a number of members of the <name> cabinet awaiting him , as well as judge <name> r. <name> , of the united states district court , who administered the oath ; and ten or a dozen others .
the scene was truly an affecting one .
secretary root could scarcely control himself , for , twenty years before , he had been at a similar scene , when vice-president <name> became chief magistrate , after the assassination of president <name> .
in a voice filled with emotion he requested vice-president <name> , on behalf of the cabinet as a whole , to take the prescribed oath .
it is recorded by an <unk> that <name> <name> was pale , and that his eyes were dim with tears , as he stepped forward to do as bidden .
his hand was uplifted , and then in a solemn voice the judge began the oath :  " i do solemnly swear that i <name> faithfully execute the office of president of the united states , and <name> , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states . "
the words were repeated in a low but distinct voice by <name> <name> , and a moment of utter silence followed .
" mr. president , please attach your signature , " went on the judge .
and in a firm hand the new chief executive wrote " <name> <name> " at the bottom of the all-important document which made him the president of our beloved country .
standing in that room , the president felt the great responsibility which now rested on his shoulders , and turning to those before him , he spoke as follows :  " in this hour of deep and terrible bereavement , i wish to state that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of president <name> for the peace and prosperity and honor of our country . "
these were no mere words , as his actions immediately afterward prove .
on reaching washington he assembled the cabinet at the home of commander <unk> , his brother-in-law , and there spoke to them somewhat in this strain :  " i wish to make it clear to you , gentlemen , that what i said at buffalo i meant .
i want each of you to remain as a member of my cabinet .
i need your advice and counsel .
i tender you the office in the same manner that i would tender it if i were entering upon the discharge of my duties as the result of an election by the people . "
having thus declared himself , the newly made president asked each member personally to stay with him .
it was a sincere request , and the cabinet members all agreed to remain by mr. <name> and aid him exactly as they had been aiding mr. <name> .
thus was it shown to the world at large , and especially to the <unk> , of which the assassin of <name> had been one , that though the president might be slain , the government still lived .
the entire country was prostrate over the sudden death of president <name> , and one of the first acts of <name> <name> , after assuming the responsibilities of his office , was to issue the following proclamation :  " a terrible bereavement has befallen our people .
the president of the united states has been struck down ; a crime committed not only against the chief magistrate , but against every <unk> and <unk> citizen .
" president <name> crowned a life of largest love for his fellow-men , of most <name> endeavor for their welfare , by a death of <name> fortitude ; and both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which , in the supreme hour of trial , he met his death , <name> remain forever a precious heritage of our people .
" it is meet that we , as a nation , express our abiding love and reverence for his life , our deep sorrow for his untimely death .
" now , therefore , i , <name> <name> , president of the united states , do appoint thursday next , <name> 19 , the day in which the body of the dead president <name> be laid in its last earthly resting-place , a day of mourning and prayer throughout the united states .
" i earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship , there to bow down in submission to the <name> of almighty god , and to pay out of full hearts their homage of love and reverence to the great and good president whose death has smitten the nation with bitter grief . "
the funeral of president <name> was a most imposing one .
the body was at first laid in state in the city hall at buffalo , where president <name> and fully a hundred and fifty thousand men , women , and children went to view the remains .
from buffalo the remains were taken by special funeral train to washington , and there placed in the rotunda of the capitol .
here the crowd was equally great , and here the services were attended by representatives from almost every civilized nation on the globe .
outside a <name> band was stationed , playing the dead president 's favorite hymns , " lead , kindly light " and " nearer , my god , to thee , " and in the singing of these thousands of mourners joined , while the tears of sorrow streamed down their faces .
from washington the body of the <unk> president was taken to canton , ohio , where had been his private home .
here his friends and neighbors assembled to do him final honor , and great arches of green branches and flowers were erected , under which the funeral <unk> passed .
as the body was placed in the receiving vault , business throughout the entire united states was suspended .
in spirit , eighty millions of people were surrounding the mortal <name> left by the passing of a soul to the place whence it had come .
it was truly a funeral of which the greatest of kings might well be proud .
the <unk> of president <name> undoubtedly had a great effect upon president <name> .
during the presidential campaign the <unk> <unk> had made many speeches in behalf of his fellow candidate , showing the high personal character of <name> , and what might be expected from the man in case he was elected once more to the office of chief magistrate .
more than this , when assistant secretary of the navy , mr. <name> had done his best to <name> out the plans <unk> by the president .
the two were close friends , and in the one brief session of the senate when he was vice-president , mr. <name> gave to president <name> many evidences of his high regard .
on returning to washington , president <name> did not at once take up his residence at the white house , preferring that the place should be left to mrs. <name> until she had sufficiently recovered from her terrible shock to arrange for the removal of the family 's personal effects .
as it may interest some of my young readers to know how president <name> 's first day as an active president was spent , i append the following , taken down at the time by a reporter for a press association :  " reached the white house from canton , on <name> 20 , 1901 , at <unk> <unk> .
went at once to the private office formerly occupied by president <name> , and , as speedily as possible , settled down for the business of the day .
" met secretary long of the navy in the cabinet room and held a discussion concerning naval matters ; received colonel <unk> to talk over some army appointments ; signed appointments of general j. m. <name> and others ; met senators <unk> and <unk> .
" at 11 a.m. called for the first time formal meeting of the cabinet and transacted business of that body until <unk> p.m. " received his old friend , general wood , and held conference with him and with secretary root in regard to cuban election laws .
" president <name> left the white house at <unk> p.m. to take lunch with secretary hay at the latter 's residence .
he was alone , disregarding the services of a body-guard .
" returned to the white house at <unk> p.m. and transacted business with some officials and received a few personal friends .
" engaged with secretary <unk> from 4 p.m. to <unk> p.m. in the transaction of public business , disposal of mail , etc .
" left the white house unattended at <unk> p.m. and walked through the <unk> streets of washington to <unk> n street , <unk> , the residence of his brother-in-law , commander <unk> .
dined in private with the family .
" late in the evening received a few close friends .
retired at 11 p.m. " it <name> be observed that special mention is made of the fact that president <name> travelled around alone .
immediately after the terrible tragedy at buffalo many citizens were of the opinion that the chief magistrate of our nation ought to be strongly protected , for fear of further violence , but to this <name> <name> would not listen .
" i am not afraid , " he said calmly .
" we are living in a peaceful country , and the great mass of our people are orderly , <unk> citizens .
i can trust them , and take care of myself . "
and to this he held , despite the protestations of his closest friends .
of course he is scarcely ever without some guard or secret service detective close at hand , but no outward display of such protection is permitted .
and let it be added to the credit of our people that , though a few <unk> and crazy persons have caused him a little annoyance , he has never , up to the present time , been molested in any way .
chapter xxvi continuing the work begun by president <name>  the panama canal agitation  visit of <name> <name> of prussia  the president at the charleston exposition president <name> had said he would continue the policy inaugurated by president <name> , and one of the important steps in this direction was to appoint many to office who had been expecting appointment at the hands of the <unk> president .
this gained him many friends , and soon some who had kept themselves at a distance flocked around , to aid him in every possible manner .
late in <name> the last of the <name> effects were taken from the white house , and some days later the newly made president moved in , with his family , who had come down from the adirondacks some time previous .
in washington the family were joined by mr. <name> 's two <unk> , commander <name> .
<unk> <unk> and mr. <name> robinson , and their wives , and the relatives remained together for some days .
it was at first feared by some politicians that president <name> would be what is termed a " <unk> president , "  that is , that he would favor one section of our country to the exclusion of the others , but he soon proved that he was altogether too <name> for such baseness .
" i am going to be president of the whole united states , " he said .
" i do n't care for sections or <unk> lines .
i was born in the north , but my mother was from the south , and i have spent much of my time in the west , so i think i can fairly represent the whole country . "
president <name> sympathized deeply with the condition of the negroes in the south , and for the purpose of learning the true state of affairs sent for mr. <name> t. washington , one of the foremost colored men of this country and founder of the <unk> industrial school for colored people .
they had a long conference at the white house , which mr. washington enjoyed very much .
for this action many criticised the president severely , but to this he paid no attention , satisfied that he had done his duty as his conscience dictated .
[ illustration : president <name> at his desk . ]
president <name> 's first message to congress was awaited with considerable interest .
it was remembered that he was the youngest executive our white house had ever known , and many were curious to know what he would say and what he proposed to do .
the <unk> congress of the united states assembled at washington , december 2 , 1901 , and on the day following , president <name> 's first annual message was read in both senate and house of representatives .
it proved to be a surprisingly long and strong state paper , and by many was considered one of the best messages sent to congress in many years .
it touched upon general conditions in our country , spoke for improvements in the army and the navy , called for closer attention to civil service reform , for a correction of the faults in the post-office system , and for a clean administration in the philippines , hawaii , and porto <name> .
it spoke of several great needs of the government , and added that the gold standard act had been found timely and judicious .
" president <name> is all right , " was the general comment , after the message had been printed in the various papers of our country .
" he is looking ahead , and he knows exactly what this country wants and needs .
we are prosperous now , and if we want to continue so , we must keep our hands on the plough , and not look backward . "
the first break in the old cabinet occurred on december 17 , when postmaster general <name> e. smith resigned .
his place was immediately filled by the appointment of <name> c. <unk> , of wisconsin .
soon after this secretary <unk> of the treasury resigned , and his place was filled by former governor <name> m. shaw , of iowa .
for a long time there had been before the american people various suggestions to build a canal across central <name> , to join the atlantic and the pacific oceans , so that the ships wanting to go from one body of water to the other would not have to take the long and expensive trip around cape horn .
in years gone by the french had also contemplated such a canal , and had even gone to work at the isthmus of panama , making an elaborate survey and doing not a little digging .
but the work was beyond them , and the french canal company soon ran out of funds and went into the hands of a receiver .
" we ought to take hold and dig a canal , " was heard on all sides in the united states .
but where to dig the canal was a question .
some said the isthmus of panama was the best place , while others preferred a route through nicaragua .
the discussion waxed very warm , and at last a commission was appointed to go over both routes and find out which would be the more satisfactory from every point of view .
the commission was not very long in reaching a decision .
the panama canal company was willing to sell out all its interest in the work already done for forty millions of dollars , and it was recommended that the united states accept this offer .
president <name> received the report , and lost no time in submitting it to congress .
at the beginning of the new year , 1902 , there was a grand ball at the white house , attended by a large gathering of people , including many of the foreign representatives <unk> to washington .
the occasion was the introduction into society of miss <name> <name> , and the affair was a most pleasing one from beginning to end .
one of the president 's sons , <name> <name> , jr. , had been sent to a boarding school at <unk> , massachusetts .
early in february he was taken down with a cold that developed into pneumonia .
it looked as if the youth might die , and both mrs. <name> and the president lost no time in leaving washington and going to his bedside .
the sympathy of the whole country was with the anxious parents , and when it was announced that the crisis had been passed in safety there was much relief in all quarters .
before this illness occurred there came to the <unk> an invitation which pleased them , and especially miss <name> , not a little .
the <name> emperor <name> was having a yacht built in this country , at <unk> island .
he sent his brother , <name> <name> of prussia , over to attend the launching , and requested miss <name> to <name> the yacht , which was to be called the meteor .
the arrival of <name> <name> was made a <name> day by many who wished to see the friendship between the united states and germany more firmly cemented than ever , and the <name> visitor was treated with every consideration wherever he went .
from new york he journeyed to washington , where he dined with the president .
he returned to new york with president <name> and with miss <name> , and on february 25 the launching occurred , in the presence of thousands of people and a great many craft of all sorts .
miss <name> performed the christening in appropriate style , and this was followed by music from a band and the blowing of hundreds of steam whistles .
after these ceremonies were over , there followed an elaborate dinner given by the mayor of new york , and then the <name> started on a tour of the country lasting two weeks .
his visit made a good impression wherever he went , and he was universally put down as a right good fellow .
it was about this time that president <name> showed he was not to be led altogether by what his party did .
so far he had not <unk> any measures sent to him for his signature .
now , however , a <name> came to him touching the desertion of a sailor in the navy .
congress was willing to strike the black record of the sailor from the books , but president <name> would not have it .
" the sailor did wrong , " he said .
" he knew what he was doing , too .
the record against him must stand . "
and he <unk> the <name> .
on the other hand he was prompt to recognize real worth in those who had served the government , and when over two hundred private pension bills came before him for his approval , he signed them without a murmur .
the people of charleston , south <name> , had been arranging for a long time to hold an exposition which should set forth the real advance and worth of the leading southern industries .
this exposition was now open to the public , and president <name> and his wife were invited to attend the exhibit .
with so much southern blood in his veins , the president could not think of refusing , and he and mrs. <name> visited the exposition early in <name> .
it was a <name> day at charleston , and the president and mrs. <name> were received with every honor due their rank , and with great personal consideration .
governor <unk> of the state was assisted by governor <unk> , of north <name> , in receiving president <name> .
a stirring patriotic speech was made by the president during his visit , and a feature of the trip was the presentation of a sword to <name> <name> jenkins of the rough riders .
a great number of president <unk> former troopers were present , and all were glad , as of old , to crowd around and take him by the hand .
chapter xxvii destruction of st. <name>  american aid  the great coal strike  president <name> ends the difficulty  tour through new england  the trolley accident in the <unk>  a providential escape from death during the summer of 1902 two matters of great importance occurred in which the whole people of our nation were deeply interested .
early in may occurred tremendous volcanic eruptions on the islands of <unk> and st. <name> .
at the former island , mont <unk> threw such a rain of fire upon the town of st. <name> that the entire place , with about thirty thousand people , was wiped out of existence in a minute .
at other points the eruptions were not so bad , yet hundreds lost their lives , and all of the islands of the lesser <unk> were thrown into a state bordering upon panic .
it was felt that something must be done , and at once , for the sufferers , and a large fund for relief was gathered , of which the americans contributed their full share .
the volcanic disturbances continued for some time , and as it was thought they might also cover certain portions of central <name> , nothing was done further concerning a canal to unite the two oceans .
the other event of importance was the strike of thousands upon thousands of <unk> , working in pennsylvania and other states .
the miners did not think they were being treated rightly and went out in a body , and for many weeks not a pound of coal of any kind was <unk> .
this produced a double hardship , for people could get no coal either for the fall or <name> , and the miners were , in some cases , reduced almost to the verge of starvation .
neither the workmen nor the <unk> of the mines would give in , and soon there was more or less violence , and some soldiers had to be called out in an effort to preserve order .
as matters went from bad to worse , and it looked as if the entire eastern section of our country would have to go without coal for the <name> , there were loud demands that the government take hold of the difficulty and settle the matter , if not in one way , then in another .
at last , early in october , the whole country was aroused , for it was felt that with no coal a <name> of untold suffering stared the people in the face .
president <name> held a conference at washington with the mine <unk> and the representatives of the miners .
" we must get together , gentlemen , " said he .
" the country can not do without coal , and you must supply it to us . "
and he laid down the law in a manner not to be misunderstood .
another conference followed , and then a third , and at last the coal <unk> asked the president to appoint a commission to decide upon the points in dispute .
to this the representative of the mine workers agreed , and as a result a commission was appointed by president <name> , which was to settle all points in dispute , and by its decision each side was to abide .
in the meantime , while the commission was at work , the mine workers were to resume their labors .
the mines were thereupon once more put in operation , after a strike lasting over five months .
this is the greatest coal strike known in american history , and it is not likely that the people at large <name> ever again permit themselves to suffer for the want of coal as they did during that fall and the <name> which followed .
early in <name> occurred the centennial celebration of the founding of the united states military academy at west point .
the occasion was made one of great interest , and among the many distinguished visitors were president <name> and general miles , head of our army at that time .
the president reviewed the cadets and made a speech to them , <unk> them on their truly excellent showing as soldiers .
although very busy with matters of state , president <name> received an urgent call to deliver a fourth of july oration at pittsburg .
he consented , and spoke to a vast assemblage on the rights and duties of american citizens .
to remain in washington during the hot summer months was out of the question with president <name> and his family , and early in the season he removed to oyster bay , there to enjoy himself as best he might during the short time allowed him for recreation .
that the business of the administration might not be too seriously interrupted , he hired a few rooms over a bank building in the village of oyster bay , and these were fitted up for himself and his several secretaries and assistants .
to the bank building he rode or drove every day , spending an hour or more over the routine work required .
by this means undesirable visitors were kept away from his private residence , and he was permitted to enjoy himself as he pleased in company with his family .
while mr. <name> was <unk> at oyster bay , it was arranged that he should make a short tour through new england , to last from <name> 22 to <name> 3 .
the trip covered every new england state , and was one of great pleasure to the president until the last day .
everywhere he went he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds , and , of course , had to make one of his characteristic speeches , accompanied by a great deal of <unk> .
on the last day of the trip he was at <name> , massachusetts , the home of governor crane .
it had been planned to drive from <name> to <unk> , a beautiful spot , adjoining <name> lake , where are located the summer homes of many american <unk> .
the trip was begun without a thought of what was to follow .
in the party , besides president <name> , were governor crane , secretary <unk> ( afterward made a member of the cabinet ) , united states secret service officer <name> <name> , and the driver of the carriage .
it may be mentioned here that <name> <name> was detailed as a special guard for the president , and had been with him since the tour was begun .
there are a number of trolley lines in this section of massachusetts , all <unk> in <unk> .
as the mass of the people were very anxious to see president <name> , the <unk> going to the points where he would pass were crowded , and the cars were run with more than usual speed .
as the carriage containing the president and his companions attempted to cross the trolley tracks a car came bounding along at a rapid rate of speed .
there seemed to be no time in which to stop the car , and in an instant the long and heavy affair crashed into the carriage with all force , hurling the occupants to the street in all directions .
the secret service officer , <name> <name> , was instantly killed , and the driver of the carriage was seriously hurt .
there was immediate and great excitement , and for the time being it was feared that president <name> had been seriously injured .
he had been struck a sharp blow on the leg , and had fallen on his face , cutting it not a little .
the shock was a severe one , but in a little while he was himself once more , although his face was much swollen .
later still a small <unk> formed on the injured limb , but this was skilfully treated by his physician , and soon disappeared .
the others in the carriage escaped with but a few bruises and a general <unk> .
the result of this accident , small as it was to the president personally , showed well how firmly he was seated in the affection of his fellow-citizens .
from all over the country , as well as from his friends in foreign climes , telegrams of <unk> came pouring in .
everybody was glad that he had escaped , and everybody wished to show how he felt over the affair .
" president <name> was much affected by the messages received , " said one who was in a position to know .
" it showed him that his friends were in every walk of life , from the highest to the lowest .
had he met death , as did the secret service officer detailed to guard over him , the shock to the people , coming so soon after the assassination of president <name> , would have been tremendous . "
the president had already been persuaded to consent to a short trip to the south , from <name> 5 to 10 , and then a trip to the west , lasting until <name> 19 , or longer .
the trips came to an end on <name> 23 , in indiana , because of the <unk> on the lower limb already mentioned , yet on november 19 he was given a grand reception by the people of memphis , tennessee , who flocked around him and were glad to see him as well as ever .
" we are so glad you escaped from that trolley accident ! "
was heard a hundred times .
" we ca n't afford to lose you , mr. president , " said others .
" really good men are too scarce . "
and then a cheer would go up for " the hero of san <name> hill ! "
his speeches on these trips were largely about the trusts and <unk> that are trying to control various industries of our country .
it is an intricate subject , yet it can be said that mr. <name> understands it as well as any one , and is laboring hard to do what is right and best , both for the <unk> and the capitalist .
congress had , some time before , voted a large sum for the extension and improvement of the white house , and while mr. <name> and his family were at oyster bay these improvements were begun .
they continued during the fall , and the president made his temporary home at a private residence in the capital city .
here it was he was treated for his wounded limb , and here he ended the coal strike , as already <unk> .
chapter xxviii new offices at the white house  sends a wireless message to king <name> of england  end of the trouble in <unk>  the canadian boundary dispute  beginning of a trip to the west  in yellowstone park the end of the year found president <name> in the best of health , despite the accident some weeks previous .
the improvements at the white house were now complete , and the family of the chief magistrate took possession .
a separate set of offices for the president and his cabinet had been built at the western end of the executive mansion , and the rooms formerly used for this purpose were turned into living apartments .
the changes made have been approved by many who have seen them , and they have wondered why the alterations were not made a long time ago .
on december 1 , congress assembled for a new session , and on the day following the president 's message was read .
it was a masterly state paper , dealing with the trust question , our relations with the new government of cuba ( for the island was now free , just as we had meant it to be when the war with spain started ) , the creation of a new department of commerce and labor , needs of the army and navy , and the all-important matter of how the philippines should be governed .
it may be added here that not long after this a department of commerce and labor was created by congress , and mr. <name> b. <unk> , the secretary to the president , became its first official head .
when mr. <unk> left his post as secretary , mr. <name> <unk> , jr. , who had been the <unk> private secretary for some time , became the regular first secretary to the chief magistrate , a place he occupies to-day .
just about this time there was considerable trouble in <unk> , mississippi .
a colored young <name> had been appointed <unk> , and the people in that vicinity refused to recognize her .
the post-office department did what it could in the matter , and then referred the case to the president .
[ illustration : the white house , showing new offices . ]
" as she has been regularly appointed , the people <name> have to accept her , " said mr. <name> .
and when there was more trouble , he sent forward an order that the post-office be shut up entirely .
this was done , and for a long time the people of that vicinity had to get their mail elsewhere , a great inconvenience to them .
on <name> 1 , 1903 , the new cable to the hawaiian islands was completed , and president <name> received a message from governor dole , and sent a reply to the same .
about two weeks later the president sent a wireless , or rather <unk> , message to king <name> of england .
this helped to <name> the beginning of a new <name> in <unk> which may cause great changes in the transmission of messages in the future .
for some time past there had been a <unk> war going on in <unk> , south <name> , between that nation on one hand and england , germany , and italy on the other .
this war had caused much disturbance to american trade .
pressure was brought to bear upon the several nations through president <name> , and at last it was agreed to leave matters to be settled by <unk> at the hague .
the agreements to this end were signed at washington , much to the president 's satisfaction .
all trouble then ceased , and american commerce was resumed as before .
for many years there had been a dispute between the united states and canada , regarding a certain boundary line .
this country claimed a long strip of territory next to the sea , near the <unk> of dyea and <unk> , and canada claimed that this strip , about thirty miles in width , belonged to her domain .
there had been endless disputes about the claim , and considerable local trouble , especially during the rush to the klondike after gold .
many americans contended that we had absolute right to the territory , and when <unk> was spoken of , said we had nothing to <unk> .
this was , in the main , president <name> 's view of the matter , yet , as things grew more disturbed , he realized , as a good business man , that something must be done .
we did not wish to fight canada and england for the strip of land , and neither did they wish to fight , so at last a board of <unk> was agreed upon , and the claims of both parties were carefully investigated .
in the end nearly every point claimed by the united states was granted to us .
it was a great satisfaction to have this <unk> dispute settled ; and how much better it was to do it by <unk> than by going to war .
the regular session of congress came to an end on march 4 , 1903 , but president <name> had already called an extra session , to consider a <name> for <unk> in our dealing with the new government of cuba and to ratify a treaty with <unk> concerning the panama canal .
there was a great deal of debating at this session of congress .
the <name> concerning cuba caused but little trouble , but many wanted the canal placed in nicaragua instead of panama , and did not wish to pay the forty millions of dollars asked for the work already accomplished by the old french canal company .
but in the end the <name> passed the united states senate by a vote of seventy-three to five , with the <unk> that should we fail to make a satisfactory arrangement about the panama canal , then the government should build the canal through nicaragua .
president <name> was enthusiastic over a canal at the isthmus , and lost no time in arranging to push the work further .
the people of the far west were very anxious to meet the chief ruler of our nation , and early in the year it was arranged that president <name> should leave washington on <name> 1 for a tour to last until <name> .
in that time he was to visit more than twenty states , and make over one hundred stops .
the people in the west awaited his coming with much pleasure .
the president was justly entitled to this outing , for the nation was now at peace with the entire world , and never had business been so prosperous .
more than this , our affairs with other nations had been so handled that throughout the entire civilized world no ruler was more popular than was <name> <name> .
in england he was spoken of with the highest praise , and the regards of the germans had already been shown in the visit of <name> <name> to this country .
he was known to be vigorous to the last degree , but it was likewise realized that he was thoroughly honest and <unk> .
the first stop of the president in his trip west was made at chicago , where during the day he laid the <unk> of the new law building of the university of chicago , which university conferred upon him the degree of <unk> .
( doctor of laws ) .
in the evening he addressed an unusually large crowd at the <unk> building , speaking upon the <name> doctrine .
from chicago the president journeyed to <unk> , and then to st. <name> and minneapolis .
at the <unk> city he made a forceful address on the trusts , giving his hearers a clear idea of how the great corporations of to-day were brought into existence , and what may be done to control them , and in the <unk> city he spoke on the <unk> question of tariff .
it was an eventful week , and when <name> came the chief magistrate was glad enough to take a day of rest at <unk> falls , south <name> .
from there he journeyed to <unk> , montana , one of the entrances to that greatest of all american <unk> , yellowstone park .
it was understood that president <name> wished to visit the park without a great following of the general public , and this wish was carried out to the letter .
mr. <name> had with him the well-known naturalist , mr. <name> <unk> , and for about two weeks he enjoyed himself to his heart 's content , visiting many of the spots of interest and taking it easy whenever he felt so disposed .
it was not a hunting trip , although big game is plentiful enough in the park .
it was just getting " near to nature 's heart , " and mr. <name> afterward declared it to be one of the best outings he had ever experienced .

chapter xxix dedication of the fair buildings at st. <name>  continuation of the trip to san <name>  up in the far north-west  back in washington  the post-office <unk>  the new republic of panama  a canal at last  proclamation regarding the war between japan and russia  opening of the great fair after the refreshing tour of yellowstone park , president <name> journeyed across <unk> to omaha , then across iowa to keokuk , and from the latter city to st. <name> .
as before , he delivered a number of addresses , and wherever he spoke great crowds came to see and to hear him .
in these crowds were people of all political tendencies , but it made no difference if they were republicans , democrats , or <unk> , all were equally glad to greet the president of the united states and the hero of san <name> hill .
on this trip he frequently met some of the rough riders , and they invariably did all in their power to make him feel at home .
on the other hand he showed that he had not forgotten them .
" by <name> , i am glad to see you ! "
he would exclaim , catching an old comrade by the hand .
and his tone of voice would show that he meant just what he said .
for a long time the people of st. <name> had been preparing for a grand fair , to be known as the louisiana purchase exposition , to commemorate the purchasing from <name> of all that vast territory of the united states which lies between the mississippi river and the <name> mountains and the gulf of mexico and british <name> .
the purchase was made in <unk> for fifteen millions of dollars , and it was hoped to hold the exposition on the one hundredth anniversary , in 1903 , but matters were delayed , and so the fair was postponed until 1904 .
the dedication of the fair buildings at the exposition grounds was held on <name> 30 , 1903 , and was made a <name> occasion by those interested .
president <name> was invited to speak , and also <unk> <name> , and both made addresses of remarkable interest .
following the dedication exercises a grand banquet was given at which the scene of good-fellowship was one not readily forgotten .
the president wished the exposition well , and promised to do all in his power to make it a success .
although the president had already travelled many miles , the greater part of his western trip still lay before him .
from st. <name> he went to kansas city and to <unk> , where the citizens were as anxious to meet him as anywhere .
he stopped at <name> springs over <name> , and then went to <name> , and to various towns in colorado and in new mexico .
while in new mexico he became interested in the systems of irrigation there , and told the people what they might do if their systems of watering the ground were increased .
having passed through the grand cañon , the second week in may found him in southern california .
he visited los <name> , reviewing the annual <unk> parade , and many other points , and at <unk> addressed a great gathering of school children in a beautiful park filled with shrubs and flowers .
the children were decidedly enthusiastic over the meeting , and when mr. <name> went away , some <unk> him with flowers , which bombardment he took in good part .
president <name> 's visit to <name> <name> jr. university in california came next , and here the students cheered him with vigor .
he visited many of the more important buildings , and was entertained by members of the faculty .
his face was now set toward the golden gate , and san <name> was all alive to give him an ovation .
it was his first official visit to the pacific coast , and all whom he met vied with each other to do him honor , while they listened with great attention to what he had to say .
three days were spent in san <name> and vicinity , and three days more in a tour of the <unk> valley .
president <name> was particularly anxious to see some of the big trees of the state , and was driven to several that are well known .
the steps of the chief magistrate were now turned northward , to oregon , and a week was spent at portland , and in the towns and cities of the <unk> sound territory , and beyond .
here he saw much that was new and novel in the lumber trade and in the salmon industry , and was received with a warmth that could not be mistaken .
" he is a president for the whole country , no mistake about that , " said more than one .
" he makes you feel he is your friend the minute you lay eyes on him , " would put in another .
to many in this far corner of our country , this visit of the president <name> ever remain as a pleasant memory .
they could never <name> to get to washington , more than three thousand miles away , and to have him come out to see them was worth remembering .
the journey eastward was made through montana to salt lake city and then to <name> , where additional addresses were delivered .
from the latter point a fast train bore him homeward , and by the next <name> he was back in the white house once more , as fresh and hearty as ever , and well prepared to undertake whatever important work might come to hand .
and work was there in plenty .
among the first things taken up by the president was a scandal in the post-office department .
without loss of time president <name> ordered postmaster general <unk> to make a thorough investigation , with the result that many contracts which were harmful to our post-office system were annulled , and some <unk> were brought to justice .
toward the end of july there was considerable disturbance in the government printing office at washington because a certain assistant foreman , who had been discharged , was <unk> .
all of the <unk> were on the point of striking because they did not want the man returned , as he did not belong to their union .
but president <name> was firm in the matter ; and in the end the man went back , and there was no strike .
this affair caused an almost endless discussion in labor circles , some claiming that the union should have been upheld , while others thought differently .
during the summer , as was his usual habit , president <name> , with his family , spent part of his time at his country home at oyster bay .
this time the visit to the old homestead was of unusual interest , for , on <name> 17 , the north atlantic fleet of the navy visited that vicinity , for review and inspection by the president .
it was a <name> occasion , and the fleet presented a handsome appearance as it filed past and thundered out a presidential salute .
many distinguished guests were present , and all without exception spoke of the steady improvement in our navy as a whole .
president <name> was equally enthusiastic , and well he might be , for he had used every means in his power to make our navy all it should be .
late in <name> president <name> returned to washington , and on october 15 delivered the principal address at the <unk> of a statue of that grand military hero , general <name> .
here once more he was listened to with tremendous interest , delivering a speech that was patriotic to the core and full of inspiration .
for some time past matters in <unk> had been in a very mixed-up condition .
the united states were willing to take hold of the panama canal , as already mentioned , but although a treaty had been made to that effect , the <unk> government would not ratify the agreement .
on november 3 , the trouble in <unk> reached its <unk> point .
on that day the state of panama declared itself free and independent .
the people of that state wanted the canal built by the united states , and were very angry when the rest of the <unk> states would not agree to the treaty which had been made .
at once there were strong rumors of war , and a few slight attacks were really made .
the united states forbade the transportation of soldiers on the panama railroad , and a few days later recognized panama as an independent republic .
the new republic was likewise recognized by <name> , and , later still , by england .
on november 9 , panama appointed a commission to negotiate a canal treaty with our country , and this treaty was signed and sealed at washington by secretary of state hay , acting for the united states , and m. <unk> , acting for panama .
the president 's next message to congress went at great length into the question of the panama canal , and in defence of the recognition of the new republic .
it also told of what the new department of commerce and labor had accomplished , especially the branch devoted to corporations .
[ illustration : president <name> speaking at the <unk> of the statue of general <name> .
( photograph by <unk> , washington , <unk> ) ] " we need not be <unk> about the welfare of corporations which shrink from the light , " wrote mr. <name> .
and in this statement every one who had the best interests of our nation at heart agreed .
to accomplish great works great corporations are often necessary , but they must conduct business in such a fashion that they are not ashamed to show their methods to the public at large .
at the opening of the year 1904 there were strong rumors of a war between japan and russia , over the occupation of <unk> , and this war started early in february by a battle on the sea , wherein the russian fleet lost several war-ships .
this contest was followed by others of more or less importance , and it looked as if , sooner or later , other nations might become involved in the struggle .
" we must keep our hands off , " said president <name> , and at once issued a proclamation , calling on all good citizens to remain strictly neutral , and warning those who might take part that they could <name> for no aid from the united states should they get into trouble personally or have any property confiscated .
this proclamation was followed by some excellent work of our state department , whereby it was agreed among the leading nations that the zone of fighting should be a limited one ,  that is , that neither japan nor russia should be allowed to <name> it beyond a certain defined territory .
for many weeks congress had debated the panama canal treaty and the action of president <name> regarding the new republic of panama .
on february 23 , 1904 , a vote was taken in the senate , and the panama canal treaty was ratified in all particulars .
without delay some united states troops were despatched to panama , to guard the strip of land ten miles wide through which the canal is to run , and preparations were made to push the work on the <unk> without further delay .
on saturday , <name> 30 , the great world 's fair at st. <name> was formally opened to the public .
it had cost over fifty millions of dollars and was designed to eclipse any fair held in the past .
the opening was attended by two hundred thousand visitors , all of whom were more than pleased with everything to be seen .
it had been arranged that president <name> should formally open the exposition by means of telegraphic communications from the white house to the fair grounds .
a key of <name> and gold was used for the purpose , and as soon as it was touched a salute of twenty-one guns roared forth in the exposition 's honor .
around the president were assembled the members of his cabinet and representatives of many foreign nations .
before touching the key which was to set the machinery of the wonderful fair in motion , president <name> spoke as follows :  " i have received from the exposition grounds the statement that the management of the louisiana purchase exposition awaits the pressing of the button which is to transmit the electric energy which is to <unk> the flag and start the machinery of the exposition .
" i wish now to greet all present , and especially the representatives of the foreign nations here represented , in the name of the american people , and to thank these representatives for the parts their several countries have taken in being represented in this centennial anniversary of the greatest step in the movement which transformed the american republic from a small confederacy of states lying along the atlantic seaboard into a continental nation .
" this exposition is one primarily intended to show the progress in the industry , the science , and the <name> , not only of the american nation , but of all other nations , in the great and wonderful century which has just closed .
every department of human activity <name> be represented there , and perhaps i may be allowed , as honorary president of the athletic association which , under european management , started to revive the memory of the olympic games , to say that i am glad that , in addition to paying proper heed to the progress of industry , of science , of <name> , we have also paid proper heed to the development of the athletic <unk> which are useful in themselves as showing that it is wise for nations to be able to relax .
" i greet you all .
i appreciate your having come here on this occasion , and in the presence of you , representing the american government and the governments of the foreign nations , i here open the louisiana exposition . "
chapter xxx personal characteristics of <name> <name>  the <unk> family  life at the white house  our country and its future in reading over the foregoing pages the question may occur to some of my young readers , how is it possible for president <name> to accomplish so much and still have time in which to occasionally enjoy himself by travelling or by going on a hunting tour ?
the answer is a very simple one .
mr. <name> works systematically , as do all who want their labor to amount to something .
years ago , when he was physically weak , he determined to make himself strong .
he persisted in vigorous exercise , especially in the open air , and in the end attained a bodily health which any ordinary man may well envy .
the president does each day 's work as it comes before him .
he does not borrow trouble or cross a bridge before he comes to it .
whatever there is to do he does to the very best of his ability , and he allows future complications to take care of themselves .
if a mistake is made , he does not worry continually over it , but keeps it in mind , so that a like mistake shall not occur again .
when once his hand is on the plough , he does not believe in turning back .
he has unlimited <name> in the future of our glorious country , and a like <name> in the honor and courage of his fellow-citizens .
any man to be an intelligent worker can not be dissipated , and the president is a good illustration of this .
he has a good appetite , but eats moderately , and does not depend upon stimulants or tobacco to " brace him up " when the work is extra heavy .
he goes out nearly every day for a walk , a ride on horseback , or a drive with some members of his family , and as a result of this , when night comes , sleeps soundly and arises the next morning as bright and fresh as ever .
this is the first time that a president with a large family has occupied the white house .
other presidents have had a few children , but mr. <name> took possession with six , a hearty , romping crowd , the younger members of which thought it great fun to explore the executive mansion when first they moved in .
the president loves his children dearly , and is not above " playing bear " with the little ones when time permits and they want some fun .
of mrs. <name> it can truthfully be said that she makes a splendid " first <name> in the land . "
she takes a great interest in all social functions , and an equal interest in what is best for her boys and girls and their friends .
she is very charitable , and each year <unk> liberally to hundreds of bazaars and fairs held throughout our country .
the oldest child of the president is miss <name> <name> <name> , named after her mother , the first wife of the chief magistrate .
although but a <unk> to the present mrs. <name> , the two are as intimate and loving as if of the same flesh and blood .
miss <name> has already made her <unk> in washington society , and assisted at several gatherings at the white house .
all of the other children were born after mr. <name> 's second marriage .
his oldest son is <name> <name> , jr. , commonly called by his chums , <name> , <unk> .
he is a lad of sixteen , bright and clever , and has been attending a college preparatory school at <unk> , massachusetts , as already mentioned .
he loves outdoor games , and is said to possess many tastes in common with his father .
the other members of the family are , <name> , fourteen , <name> <unk> , twelve , <unk> bullock , nine , and a lively little boy named <name> , who is six .
some time ago a distinguished member of the english educational commission visited this country and made an inspection of our school system .
when asked what had impressed him most deeply , he answered :  " the children of the president of the united states sitting side by side with the children of your <unk> in the public schools . "
this simple little speech speaks volumes for the good , hard common sense of our president .
he believes thoroughly in our public institutions , and knows the real value of sending out his boys to fight their own battles in the world at large .
he does not believe in <unk> children , but in making them <unk> .
all love to go out with him , and when at oyster bay he frequently takes the boys and their cousins for a day's tramp through the woods or along the beach , or else for a good hard row on the bay .
the president prefers rowing to sailing , and frequently rows for several miles at a stretch .
his enjoyment of bathing is as great as ever , and his boys love to go into the water with him .
christmas time at the white house is just as full of <name> there as it is anywhere .
the younger children <name> up their stockings , and scream with delight over every new toy received .
for some days previous to christmas one of the rooms is turned into a storeroom , and to this only mrs. <name> and one of the maids hold the key .
presents come in from everywhere , including many for the president , for his friends far and near insist upon remembering him .
these presents are arranged on a large oval table near one of the broad windows , and on christmas morning the distribution begins .
the president , in his trips to the woods , has seen the great harm done by cutting down promising evergreens , so he does not believe very much in having a christmas tree .
but a year ago a great surprise awaited him .
" i 'm going to fix up a tree , " said little <name> , and managed to smuggle a small evergreen into the house and place it in a large closet that was not being used .
here he and his younger brother <name> worked for several days in arranging the tree just to suit them .
on christmas morning , after the presents were given out , both asked their father to come to where the closet was located .
" what is up now ? "
asked mr. <name> , curiously .
" come and see ! "
they shouted .
and he went , followed by all the others of the family .
then the closet door was thrown open , and there stood the tree , blazing with lights .
it was certainly a great surprise , and mr. <name> enjoyed it as much as anybody .
the children of washington , and especially those whose fathers occupy public positions , always look forward with anticipations of great pleasure to the children 's parties given by mrs. <name> , and these parties are of equal interest to those living at the mansion .
[ illustration : president <name> and his family .
( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] such a party was given during the last holidays , and was attended by several hundred children , all of whom , of course , came arrayed in their best .
they were received by mrs. <name> , who had a <unk> and a kind word for each , and then some of the cabinet ladies , who were assisting , gave to each visitor a button , set in ribbon and tinsel and inscribed " <name> christmas and happy new year . "
the big main dining-room of the white house had been prepared for the occasion .
there was a christmas tree at one side of the room , and the table was filled with fruit , cake , and <name> .
the president came in and helped to pass the ice-cream and cake , and <name> , jr. and some of the others passed the <name> and other good things .
after this the visitors were asked to go to the east room and dance .
the <name> band furnished the music , and while the children were dancing , the president came in to look at them .
the entertainment lasted until the end of the afternoon , and when the visitors departed , president <name> was at the door to shake hands and bid them good-by .
and here let us bid good-by ourselves , wishing <name> <name> and his family well .
what the future holds in store for our president no man can tell .
that he richly deserves the honors that have come to him , is beyond question .
he has done his best to place and keep our united states in the front rank of the nations of the world .
under him , as under president <name> , progress has been remarkably rapid .
in the uttermost parts of the world our flag is respected as it was never respected before .
perhaps some few mistakes have been made , but on the whole our advancement has been justified , and is eminently satisfactory .
the future is large with possibilities , and it remains for the generation i am addressing to rise up and embrace those opportunities and make the most of them .

<name> and <name> are aboard of their old ship , the columbia , bound from manila to nagasaki , with a cargo designed for the japanese government .
this is during the war between russia and japan , and when close to the japanese coast the schooner is sighted by a russian warship and made a prize of war .
as prisoners both <name> and <name> see something of life in the russian navy .
when close to <unk> , the russian warship falls in with several ships of the japanese fleet , and after a thrilling <unk> <unk> with her prize .
this brings <name> and <name> before admiral togo , and as <name> 's brother <name> , with their mutual friend , <name> pennington , is already in the japanese army , <name> enters the japanese navy and <name> follows suit .
the siege and bombardment of port <name> are at their height ; and the particulars are given of many battles both on the sea and on land , leading up to the ultimate surrender of that brave russian commander , general <unk> , and the fall of the city .
by this surrender the japanese obtained many thousands of prisoners of war , hundreds of cannon , with large quantities of ammunition , and several scores of vessels , useful for either fighting purposes or as transports .
moreover , this victory placed the entire southern portion of <unk> under japanese control , giving the army <unk> use of the railroad running from port <name> to <unk> , a city on the road to <unk> , captured some time before , as already related in another volume of this series , entitled " under the mikado 's flag . "
as i have mentioned in a previous work , it is as yet impossible to state what the outcome of this terrific conflict <name> be .
so far victory has perched largely upon the standard of japan .
the russian navy has been practically shattered and its army fought to a standstill .
the cost of the war has been tremendous to both countries .
countless thousands of lives have already been sacrificed .
would that peace were soon at hand !
again i thank my young friends for their appreciation of my former stories .
may the present tale fulfill every reasonable expectation .

fall of port <name>  conclusion 274 at the fall of port <name> at the fall of port <name> chapter i <name> and his friends " unless i miss my guess , <name> , we are going to have a storm . "
" jest what i was thinking , <name> .
and when it comes i allow as how it <name> be putty heavy , " replied <name> striker , casting an eye to the westward , where a small dark cloud was beginning to show above the horizon .
" well , we ca n't expect fine weather all the time , " went on <name> <name> , inspecting the cloud with equal interest .
" we want some wind anyway , " he added .
" we are not making this return trip to nagasaki nearly as fast as we made the trip to manila . "
<name> striker , a bronzed and weather-beaten yankee sailor , rubbed his <name> reflectively .
" i was jest thinking o ' the day i spied the old columbia in manila harbor , " he said , meditatively .
" tell ye , <name> , the sight 'most struck me dumb .
'the columbia , ' sez i to myself .
an' then i thought i must be <unk> ' .
i wanted to find this ship ag'in in the worst way . "
" the ship certainly seems like a home to me , <name>  and i reckon she always <name> seem that way .
i 've traveled a good many miles in her , since i first struck her at honolulu in the hawaiian islands , " responded <name> <name> .
" yes  both of us have .
but we never took no trip like this afore  carryin ' a cargo for the japanese government , with that government at war with russia . "
<name> striker lowered his voice .
" what's the outlook ?
does the old man reckon to fall in with a russian warship afore we can reach nagasaki ? "
" hush , <name> ; you must n't mention our cargo , " came from <name> <name> , hastily .
" i ai n't <unk> ' it to anybody but you . "
" captain ponsberry is in hopes that we shall not meet any russian warships . "
" but what if we do ? "
" then we shall have to show our heels as best we can . "
" a sailing vessel ca n't show much o ' a pair o ' heels to a man-o'-war . "
" that is true . "
" i suppose , if the columbia was overhauled by a russian warship , they 'd consider us a prize of war ; would n't they ? "
continued the old yankee sailor .
" they would , unless captain ponsberry could get out of it in some way . "
" how do you think he might get out of it ? "
" well , you must remember that our cargo does n't belong to the japanese government yet .
we are carrying it from manila to nagasaki for the richmond importing company .
the russians would have to prove their case against us before they could claim the schooner as a legitimate prize of war . "
" i see .
well , i reckon as how them russians would do 'most anything to square accounts with the japs .
so far , accordin ' to my notions , they have been <unk> ' ground right along in this war . "
" yes , and they 'll lose more before the japs are through with 'em , <name> .
but that storm is coming up fast , " went on <name> <name> , with another examination of the black cloud .
" i 'll have to tell the captain .
if we do n't shorten sail it may do us some damage . "
with the <unk> remark <name> <name> walked aft , toward the companionway of the columbia , a staunch <unk> schooner that hailed from gloucester .
he was second mate of the craft and as such it was now his duty to inform captain nat ponsberry that a storm was approaching .
to those of my young friends who have read " under <name> at manila " and other volumes of the " old <name> series " <name> <name> needs no introduction .
he was one of three brothers , who , left in the charge of a miserly <unk> , had thought it best to go away from home and seek fortune in various parts of the globe .
<name> had drifted to san <name> and then to honolulu , where he had fallen in with captain nat ponsberry and the columbia , as already mentioned .
he , with his sailor friend , <name> striker , had been cast away , and while adrift on the pacific had been picked up by the asiatic squadron under commodore ( afterward admiral ) <name> , to serve with honor during the memorable battle of manila bay .
since those days a great many things had occurred to the <name> boys .
<name> , the oldest of the three , had served as a young volunteer in cuba during the advance on <name> , and as an officer with the army in the philippines , and <name> , the third brother , had served in the navy in cuban waters and elsewhere .
in the meantime the miserly <unk> had reformed , and now thought " his three boys , " as he called them , " the best young fellers in all <name> , barrin ' none ! "
<name> <name> was a natural sailor , and when his term in the navy came to an end he could not bear to think of giving up the sea .
he heard that his old ship was bound for a trip to japan and other ports , and at once communicated with captain ponsberry , with the result that he became second mate of the schooner , the first mate being , as of old , <name> grandon , a personal friend of captain ponsberry .
at this time <name> <name> had gone into business , and was doing remarkably well .
but <name> was doing nothing , and <name> persuaded his oldest brother to come aboard the ship at manila , for the trip to nagasaki and port <name> .
this was just at the outbreak of the war between russia and japan , but the brothers at that time knew nothing about the tremendous conflict so close at hand .
the columbia was carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company , represented in japan and <name> by <name> pennington , who had served with <name> <name> in our army in cuba and the philippines .
from manila <name> had gone to <name> , to fight the <unk> , as already described in " on to pekin , " the first volume of this " soldiers of fortune series . "
with the end of the boxer conflict , lieutenant pennington , as he had then become , turned from war to business , and soon made a number of business transactions which were highly gratifying to the company that he represented .
when the columbia arrived at nagasaki , captain ponsberry learned that the war had begun and that to get to port <name>  a russian stronghold in <unk>  was out of the question .
while he was awaiting orders <name> pennington appeared on the scene .
<name> had had great difficulties in getting away from port <name> , having been suspected by the russian officials of being a spy .
he wished to know at once if the ship 's cargo was safe .
" as safe as when we left home , " had been captain ponsberry 's reply .
" good ! "
answered the young agent , and then he wished to know if anything had been done about selling the goods .
captain ponsberry replied that he had been ordered to do nothing until he received word from <name> .
this suited the young representative ; and the upshot of the matter was that the cargo , instead of going to a russian port , was sold to the japanese government at a price considerably above the ordinary market value .
<name> pennington was enthusiastic about joining the japanese army for a campaign in <unk> and he imparted a large share of this enthusiasm to <name> <name> .
as a result both enlisted and became captains in a special command , under a <name> okopa , who could speak very good english .
the part of the army to which they were assigned landed at <unk> , in <unk> , and in the second volume of this series , called " under the mikado 's flag , " i related the particulars of the crossing of the <unk> river and of the many skirmishes and battles leading up to the terrific <unk> ' contest before <unk> <name> .
during these fights <name> and <name> did their full duty as officers , and when the russians retreated to the north both were well content to take a <unk> rest .
but additional struggles were still in store for them , as <name> be learned in the pages which follow .
at first <name> <name> had been inclined to follow his brother and his friend <name> into the japanese army .
but captain ponsberry did not wish to lose his services as a second mate , and when it was decided that the columbia should make a quick run to manila and back , for another cargo for the japanese government , he made up his mind to stick to the ship .
the run to manila from nagasaki was made without special incident , and , once at the main seaport of the philippines , captain ponsberry lost no time in getting on board the cargo the richmond importing company had ready for him .
the cargo was a valuable one and it was calculated that if rightly sold it would yield the company a profit of five or six thousand dollars .
" you have got to take care and not run into any russian warship , " said the agent of the company at manila .
" if you do you may have a whole lot of trouble in explaining matters to the russian <unk> satisfaction .
i see by the reports that the russians have already held up several english and south american ships . "
" i shall keep a sharp lookout for 'em , " was captain ponsberry 's reply .
" and another thing , captain , " went on the agent , in a lower tone ; " you want to watch your crew . "
" what do you mean ? "
" i do n't like the looks of two or three of them .
for all you know they may be more than willing to expose you  if you fall in with the russians .
can you trust your first and second mates ? "
" i can !
they are as honest as myself . "
" then caution them to keep an eye on the hands .
one of those fellows looks like a russian to me  the chap with the heavy black beard . "
" you mean semmel .
he says he is a pole and that he hates the russians . "
" humph !
well , i saw him talking to a lot of russians night before last .
and when they passed a jap the whole crowd jeered at the little brown man . "
" semmel , too ? "
" yes . "
" then i shall watch him , " answered captain ponsberry , decidedly .
" do , but do n't let him know it .
some of these foreign sailors are ugly when they find out they are being suspected . "
" trust me to manage him , " returned the commander of the columbia ; and there the talk on the subject came to an end .
chapter ii a storm on the pacific <name> found captain ponsberry working over a chart on the cabin table , laying out the course of the ship .
the commander of the columbia was a bluff , hearty individual and he and the young second mate thought a great deal of each other .
" well , what is it ? "
asked the captain , looking up quickly .
" i came to report that a storm is coming up from the west , " answered <name> .
" humph !
i was afraid we 'd catch it sooner or later .
is it close up yet ? "
" it 's coming up pretty fast . "
captain ponsberry said no more , but threw down his parallel rulers and his pencil .
catching up his cap , he mounted to the deck , and the young second mate followed at his heels .
the captain gave a long look to the westward and then a gaze around the remainder of the horizon .
" tell cal <name> to call all hands to shorten sail ! "
he called out to <name> .
" tell 'em to tumble up quick , too  thet storm ai n't none too far off for comfort ! "
<name> passed the word to cal <name> , who was the boatswain of the columbia , and soon the whistle piped up shrilly , and those who were below or in the forecastle , came on deck in a hurry .
already the wind was <unk> , <unk> up the <unk> in all directions .
the sky , that had been so blue a short while before , became leaden , and the depths of the ocean took on a somber <name> .
the barometer indicated a great and immediate change .
" lay aloft there , men ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" our sails are mostly new and we do n't want them ripped up if we can help it .
skip along there , peterson ! "
the latter words to a big sailor who was moving across the deck at a snail 's pace .
the sailor addressed , scowled .
it was not his watch on deck and he hated to have his midday nap disturbed .
" got a nail in <name> boot , " he said .
" well , haul it out  after the sails are trimmed , " returned the captain , and then turned to another hand : " semmel , what 's the matter with you ? "
this to the <unk> sailor with the heavy black beard .
" nodding , " grumbled semmel , and turned away sulkily .
" then get a move on , or we may lose a stick as well as a sail , " and there followed a perfect volley of orders in a tone that none of the sailors misunderstood .
up to the yards they crawled like so many monkeys , and soon the creaking of <unk> blocks was heard , as the <unk> came down .
the jib and flying jib were also taken in , and a little later the <unk> and the <unk> .
" reckon we can stand the <unk> for a little while longer , " said captain ponsberry to <name> grandon .
" what do you think ? "
" we can , unless it comes quicker nor it is coming now , " returned the first mate .
" well , keep an eye on the wind and reef her as soon as it begins to look nasty , " said captain ponsberry , and returned to the cabin , to finish his nautical calculations .
the columbia had left the last of the philippines behind and was headed north through the <name> sea toward the lower extremity of <unk> .
she was not as new a ship as when <name> had first boarded her at honolulu , for since that time she had seen half a dozen years of hard service .
but captain ponsberry was a careful man and believed in making repairs as soon as they were needed , so there was small danger of her opening her seams or going to pieces even in the <unk> of blows .
she leaked a little  the best of ships do that  but a short pumping every morning kept the water at the bottom of the well .
as second mate , it was <name> 's duty to see that everything on the deck was " <unk> , " and this was especially necessary when a storm was coming up .
he made a tour of the ship , his keen eyes taking in every detail .
as it happened , an hour before he had set the sailor semmel to work stowing away some odds and ends of rope .
he had supposed that this task was long since finished , but now he found the ropes scattered about as before .
" see here , semmel , " he called out , " why did n't you stow away those ropes as i told you ? "
" stow dem avay in a leetle vile , " answered the sailor with the heavy beard .
" you 'll stow them away now , " returned <name> , sharply .
he did not at all fancy the manner of the hand he was addressing .
" i told you to do it an hour ago .
we do n't want anything loose on deck when this storm hits us . "
" <name> kicked de ropes out dare , " growled semmel .
" i had nodding to do mit 'em . "
" that is n't here or there .
i told you to stow them away , and i want you to do it .
if you do n't , i 'll have to report you to the captain . "
" oh , i do him ! "
grumbled semmel , but he glared at <name> as if he wished to chew the young second mate up .
" you put all dare <unk> on me , hey ? "
he added , after a pause .
" you 've got to do your share of it . "
" humph ! "
semmel seemed on the point of saying more , but shut his teeth and began to arrange the ropes in proper order .
<name> watched him for a moment and then walked away .
as soon as his back was turned the sailor shook his fist at the young second mate .
" you <unk> ! "
he muttered .
" chust <unk> , you <unk> rat ! "
the sky kept growing darker , and soon came a puff of wind much heavier than any that had gone before .
the columbia had been moving over the waves on an even keel , but now she gave a sudden lurch to starboard .
" reckon it 's time to take them reefs in the <unk> , " said grandon to <name> , and soon the sailors were at work on the sheets , leaving just sufficient canvas up to make the schooner mind her helm .
it was hard work , for the sudden gusts made the sail snap and crack like a whip .
so far it had not rained a drop , but now came a sudden downpour , the drops " as big as hen 's eggs , " to use <name> striker 's manner of describing them .
then came a flash of lightning out of the western sky , followed by a rumble of thunder .
" this is going to be an old-time storm , " was <name> 's comment , as he met <name> striker near the forecastle .
" i 'll have to get my oilskin out . "
<name> already had his <unk> on and soon the young mate was similarly provided .
wind and rain were increasing , and presently there came a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder that made everybody jump .
the thunder brought captain ponsberry to the deck in a hurry .
" did that hit us ? "
he questioned , looking around anxiously .
" no , sir , but it was pretty close , " replied grandon .
" is everything secure ? "
went on the commander , to <name> .
" yes , sir . "
it was difficult to converse further , for the wind was now whistling through the rigging , driving the rain in sheets across the deck .
all had to hold fast for fear of being swept overboard .
on every side the sea was lashing itself into a foam and the waves were growing higher and higher .
at one instant the columbia would seem to be riding on top of a mountain , the next she would sink down and down into the trough of the sea .
" well , <name> , how do you like this ? "
questioned captain ponsberry , as he took a position beside the second mate .
" oh , i do n't mind it at all , " was the cheery answer .
" i used to mind the storms , but i 've got used to them . "
" this is n't a plaything we are getting . "
" oh , i know that  you can see it by the way the wind is driving us .
but we are not near any land , are we ? "
" no . "
" then we 'll be sure to <unk> it .
i feel i can bank on the old columbia for almost anything . "
at this captain ponsberry laid an affectionate hand on his second <unk> shoulder .
" reckon you love the old craft about as well as i do , " he said .
" i do n't know about that  you 've been on board so many more years than myself .
but to me she is a second home . "
" i see .
well , let us <name> we get through with this trip in safety . "
" do n't you imagine we 'll do it ? "
questioned <name> , quickly .
" certainly .
but you must remember that we may have trouble if we fall in with any russian warship . "
captain ponsberry lowered his voice .
" did you have trouble with semmel ? "
" a little .
i ordered him to coil up some ropes and he did n't obey me right away .
but he stowed them away afterwards . "
captain ponsberry <name> a long breath .
" the more i see of that chap the less i like him . "
" i never liked him from the start , " answered <name> , frankly .
" but you'll have to give him credit for being a good <unk> sailor . "
" there is no doubt but what he is that , <name> .
but he has a bad eye . "
" what do you think he could do to harm us ? "
" nothing  unless we fell in with a russian warship .
in that case , if he was a russian <unk> , he might expose the fact that while we are carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company the goods are really meant for the japanese government . "
" does he know that ? "
" i 'm not sure , one way or the other .
what i am afraid of is , that he may know a good bit more nor we suspect . "
" i see . "
the young second mate mused for a moment .
" i 'll tell you what i 'd do , if i thought he was going to play me foul  and we fell in with a russian warship .
i 'd clap him below decks , out of sight until the warship went on her way again . "
" that 's easily said ; but i ca n't make him a prisoner unless i can prove something against him . "
" you can lock him up if he is sulky and wo n't obey orders . "
" yes , that is true .
still   phew ! "
the captain broke off short , for a vivid streak of lightning flared all over the upper masts of the ship .
the <unk> was as sharp as it was deafening , and for the moment all on board thought the columbia had surely been struck .
then came a downpour which made even the boldest of the sailors seek shelter .
" that was closer than i like , " was <name> 's comment , after it was ascertained that the ship was unharmed .
" 'most knocked me overboard , " came from <name> striker .
" gosh !
reckon my hair 's singed , " and he put up his hand and ran his fingers through his <unk> locks .
" do n't want another like thet nohow ! "
a few minutes later came another flash of lightning , but this was to the eastward , showing that the center of the storm had passed them .
the wind was apparently going down , but the sea was as angry as ever and would be for hours to come .
<name> had retired to the forecastle with several other sailors .
<unk> watch on deck was also at an end , and he was just on the point of going below , when from the west came a curious humming sound which made the young second mate pause .
the humming increased , and then of a sudden the columbia was caught in a hurricane blast that threw her far over on her side .
" help ! "
<name> heard , in the voice of captain ponsberry .
" somebody help me , quick , or i 'll go overboard ! "
chapter iii <name> learns something the accident which had happened to captain nat ponsberry was certainly a curious one , although similar to that which once cost the life of a young officer in our navy .
when the hurricane blast reached the columbia , the captain was in the act of slipping on a lined <unk> ,  a big affair , with long sleeves and an extra high collar .
one arm was in the coat and the other was going down the sleeve when it caught in the lining .
at that instant the shock threw the captain across the deck and almost over the railing .
he caught at the railing with his free hand , but his other hand remained a prisoner in the coat sleeve , while the garment itself stuck in a bunch across his shoulders .
" help ! "
he roared again .
he tried to pull himself up , and to free the hand in the sleeve , but found both impossible .
<name> did not wait for a second cry for assistance .
he knew the captain so well that he felt the officer would only call when in dire peril .
he ran out on the slippery deck in double-quick order .
" hullo , where are you ? "
he yelled .
" here !
help ! "
the young second mate caught sight of the captain not a moment too soon .
another lurch of the columbia had thrown him completely over the rail , and there he clung with one hand , while the spray was flying all over him .
not waiting to count the possible cost , <name> slid rather than ran to the rail .
years before he had learned a trick which now stood him in good stead .
he wound his legs around the under rail , catching the upper one with his left hand .
then he clutched captain ponsberry by the <unk> arm .
" on deck there ! "
he yelled .
" throw a rope this way , and hurry up about it ! "
" what 's the trouble ? "
came from <name> grandon , who had been in another part of the ship and had not heard the captain 's cry .
" the captain is almost overboard .
throw us a rope . "
<name> grandon was quick to act .
the rope came whizzing toward <name> , and in a twinkling he had it around his body and also around the captain .
" haul in ! "
he called , and grandon and two sailors did so .
over the rail came captain ponsberry , still fighting to release the <unk> arm .
in a moment more all danger was past .
" well , how in the world did this happen ? "
questioned grandon .
" tell ye  soon as i can git free o ' this <unk> coat ! "
spluttered captain ponsberry , and he gave the garment a jerk that ripped one of the sleeves completely in half .
" did ye ever see sech foolishness ? "
he added .
and then he told how the lurch of the ship had carried him over the rail just when he could use but one hand .
" after this i reckon i'll put on my coat afore i go on deck , " he concluded .
" it was a lucky thing that <name> heard you cry out , " said the first mate .
" i was at the wheel , helping <unk> . "
" that 's right , <name> . "
the captain turned to the youth .
" <name> , you 're a brave one , and always was .
i ai n't going to forget this ! "
" oh , do n't say anything about it , " came from the young second mate , modestly .
" i know you 'd do as much for me , if i needed it . "
" well , i would , an ' there 's my hand on it , " cried captain ponsberry , heartily , and gave <name> a grip that made him wince .
the storm kept up for the remainder of the day .
but its worst fury was spent , and during the night the wind went down to nothing more than a stiff breeze , which was just what was wanted .
all of the sails were again set ; and the schooner resumed her course as before .
before leaving manila <name> had purchased a number of newspapers printed in that city in english .
so far he had had no chance to look the sheets over , but now came two days in which there was little to do , and he spent several hours in devouring the news , while he also let his friend <name> do some reading .
" tell ye what , this 'ere war between russia and japan is goin ' to be a big thing , " said <name> , after reading an account of the first fights on land and on sea .
" it ai n't goin ' to be no such short affair as our little <unk> in <unk> . "
" you are right , <name> ; this war is going to be a long and bitter one . "
" who is goin ' to win , do you think ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know .
russia is a vast country , with millions of people and with an immense army and navy .
i suppose she can put five times as many men in the field as japan can . "
" but them japs know how to fight . "
" indeed they do  they have proved that already .
and what is to their advantage , they are closer to <unk> and <unk> than russia is .
they can get on the fighting ground quicker ,  which counts for a good deal . "
" how those russians must have been astonished when the japanese warships sailed into 'em at port <name> last february .
i do n't believe they were expecting an attack . "
" hardly , for war had just been declared .
but you would n't have caught uncle <name> napping like that , <name> . "
" right ye are , lad ; it ai n't his style .
an ' then to see how them japs have been <unk> ' up the russian warships ever since .
they must have a fine navy . "
" yes , and good gunners , too .
i was told in nagasaki that quite a few american gunners were on their ships  fellows who served under <name> at manila and under sampson and schley off cuba . "
" i believe you , lad .
when a feller gits it in his bones to fight on a warship there ai n't no life on a merchantman goin ' to satisfy him .
some jackies would rather fight nor eat  you know thet as well as i do . "
" well , i should n't mind doing some fighting myself .
you know i was on a stand about going with <name> and <name> pennington . "
" where do you reckon they are now ? "
" in <unk> , i suppose , fighting as hard as they can .
i thought i would get a letter from them before we left manila , but nothing came . "
" i suppose the mails are all upset , on account of the war , " put in cal <name> , who sat nearby , sewing a button on his shirt .
" if you'll remember , nagasaki was in a big state of excitement while we were there last . "
" did they say anything about any russian warships bein ' in these parts ? "
questioned <name> .
" no . "
" it would be strange if we did fall in with them . "
" which puts me in mind , " came from the boatswain , and then he gazed around to see if any other persons were near .
" semmel says he ai n't no russian , but it 's dollars to doughnuts he is , " he continued , in a lowered tone .
" have you discovered anything new ? "
demanded <name> .
" yes and no .
last night i overheard him and peterson talking in a suspicious kind of a way .
i did n't catch much , for they talked partly in english and partly in a foreign language .
but i am sure they are <unk> russia , and semmel said something about doing something to harm japan . "
" i do n't see how they could do anything on board of this ship , " came from <name> .
" you did n't hear anything definite ? "
" ca n't say that i did , " answered the boatswain .
" we had better watch them closer than ever . "
" all right ; i 'll do my share , " responded <name> , and <name> striker said the same .
that very afternoon <name> had another quarrel with the sailor with the long beard .
semmel had a bucket of dirty water which he was carrying to the ship 's side .
as <name> passed he pretended to <unk> his toe and allowed some of the dirty water to flow over the young second <unk> foot .
" semmel , what did you do that for ? "
cried <name> , indignantly .
" <unk> help dat , " said the sailor .
" i slip . "
" you did it on purpose ! "
" oh , no ! "
and the sailor grinned wickedly .
" i say you did .
if you try anything like that again , i 'll make it warm for you .
get a swab and clean the deck up at once ! "
as semmel sauntered off , and while <name> was stamping the water from his shoe , captain ponsberry came up .
he had seen the trick played from a distance .
" what did you tell semmel ? "
he questioned , sharply .
" told him to swab the deck up .
i think he <unk> the dirty water over me on purpose . "
" just my idea of it .
i 'll tell him what i think of it . "
and striding after the bearded sailor captain ponsberry gave him a lecture not to be readily forgotten .
" i wo n't have any of your dirty underhanded work aboard of my ship , " he concluded .
" either you 'll behave yourself , or i 'll put you in irons . "
" in irons ! "
ejaculated semmel , scowling viciously .
" that is what i said and that is what i mean .
ever since you came on board you have been acting in this same dirty fashion and i want it stopped .
now swab up that deck , and see that you make a first-class job of it .
for two pins i 'd make you black <name> 's shoes . "
" no black nobody 's shoes , " growled semmel , but in such a low tone that captain ponsberry could not hear him .
he cleaned the deck in his own ugly , independent manner , muttering imprecations against both <name> and the captain in the meantime .
as a matter of fact , even though he had denied it to captain ponsberry and others , ostag semmel was really a russian by birth , having been born and raised in the seaport of <unk> .
he had been drafted into the army , but not wishing to serve under a military rule which is unusually severe , he had run away to sea and become a sailor .
life on the ocean suited semmel very well and he would have remained away from russia had it not been for the fact that a <name> uncle had died leaving him a property valued at two thousand dollars  a small fortune in the eyes of a man of this russian 's standing .
he wished to go back to claim his inheritance , but feared to do so , for he knew that once on russian soil he would be arrested for desertion , and might be sent to a military prison for a great number of years .
from a friend in manila he had heard of something which interested him greatly .
this was the news that another deserter from the russian army had been pardoned for his offense because he had taken home with him important news concerning the movements of a certain japanese warship .
" if i could only do as well , " he told himself , over and over again , and then , when he signed articles for the <unk> trip , he listened eagerly to some talk he overheard about the ship 's cargo .
when he began to suspect the truth  that the cargo was meant for the japanese government  his eyes glistened cunningly .
" if i can only let russia know of this ! "
he reasoned .
" all <name> go well with me .
if i can only let russia know ! "
chapter iv the russian sailor 's plot captain ponsberry 's stern manner made ostag semmel wild with hatred , and when he went back to the forecastle after <unk> up the deck he was in a fit mental condition for almost any dark deed .
for a good half-hour he lay in his bunk in a corner , brooding over his ill-luck and wondering what he could do to revenge himself upon both the master of the schooner and <name> .
<name> he especially disliked  the very <unk> of the young second mate made him long to do the lad harm .
at the end of the half-hour another sailor came in .
it was <name> peterson , his close friend .
peterson was a burly tar who had visited nearly every quarter of the globe .
he loved to drink and <unk> , and was ever ready to lend a hand in any excitement that offered .
there was a rumor that he had once led a mutiny on a danish merchant vessel , but this he denied , laying the blame entirely on others .
" is that you , peterson ? "
demanded semmel , in his native tongue , for he knew that the other could speak russian fluently .
" yes , " came in a rough voice from peterson .
he gave a coarse laugh .
" a fine job you made of it , to pour dirty water over <name> and then have to swab up the deck for it . "
" who told you of that ? "
" did n't i see it with my own eyes  and heard what the captain said , too . "
" bah !
it makes me sick ! "
growled semmel .
" i am sick of the ship  the crew  everything ! "
peterson gave a short toss of his head , which was covered with a shock of fiery red hair .
" what are you going to do about it ?
even if the captain treats you like a dog , what shall you do , ostag semmel ?
he thinks we are all curs  door mats to wipe feet on ! "
" he shall find out that i am neither a dog nor a door mat ! "
muttered the bearded russian .
" by my right hand i promise you that ! "
" talk is cheap  it takes wind to make the mill go , " answered peterson .
to an outsider it would have been plain to see that he was leading semmel on , in an endeavor to find out what was in his companion 's mind .
" it <name> not end in talk . "
" bah !
i have heard that before . "
" i have been thinking , " went on ostag semmel , slowly .
" can i trust you ? "
" you know you can . "
" you do not love the captain  do not love that <name> ? "
" do i act as if i did ? "
" good !
now , how many on board of this ship ? "
" fourteen men , counting in ourselves . "
" you count fairly .
fourteen , how many are our friends ? "
" <unk> and conroy , at least . "
" then we are four , so far .
now , what of <unk> and shamhaven and <name> <name> ? "
" <unk> is a good fellow and a man who wishes to make money . "
" and shamhaven <name> do almost anything for money  he once told me so .
he took a sailor suit from a store in manila without paying for it . "
" i know that too .
the tailor was <name> and did n't need the money , " and peterson gave another coarse laugh .
" then we are six  to stand up for our rights .
and <name> <name> <name> make seven  just half the number on the ship . "
" how can we count that <name> in ?
he is a yankee . "
" he is a <unk> and we can manage him ,  and i think we can manage some others , too  when we get that far . "
" how far do you mean ? "
demanded peterson , although he knew about what was coming .
" is anybody else near here ? "
" no , " and peterson took a careful look around .
" supposing we seize the ship  in the name of the russian government ?
they have a japanese cargo on board , the captain can not deny it .
we can take the ship , sail her to some russian port , and win both prize money and <name> .
is it not a grand scheme ? "
" <name> , that is fine ! "
<name> peterson 's eyes glowed <unk> .
" ostag , you are a man after my own heart !
we might become <name> ! "
" then you like the plan ? "
" yes  providing we can make it work .
but it is a big undertaking .
if we were caught we might swing from a <unk> for it . "
" we can make it work  i have another plan for that .
i have thought it out completely .
we can  but more later , " and ostag semmel broke off abruptly , as several sailors entered the forecastle .
a little later he began to complain in broken english to a sailor named <name> <name> that he was suffering from a severe stomach ache .
" sorry to hear on it , " said <name> , who was a very mild foremast hand .
" anything i can do for you ? "
" i dink not , " answered semmel .
" i dink de poor grub ve git mak me feel pad . "
" did n't notice that the grub was poor , " answered <name> .
" very poor  not so goot as py my las ' ship , " answered semmel .
" some grub here not fit to eat . "
it was soon noised around that semmel was not feeling well and that he had complained that the food dealt out at <unk> had made him sick .
as soon as captain ponsberry heard of this he went to interview <name> , the colored cook , who , as of old , was singing gayly to himself among the pots and pans of the ship 's galley .
" was n't nuffin de <unk> wid dat grub , cap'n ponsberry , " exclaimed <name> , after hearing what the commander of the ship had to say .
" it was <name> as good as we always has . "
" was it thoroughly cooked ? "
" yes , sah  i do n't <unk> nuffin to go from dis yere galley 'less it am well cooked . "
" are your pots and kettles clean ? "
" yes , sah  yo ' can see fo ' yourself , sah . "
the captain did see , and moreover he knew that <name> was usually a careful and conscientious culinary artist who always gave the men the best his stock afforded .
" well , be careful of what you cook and how you cook it after this , " said captain ponsberry .
" would yo ' mind tellin ' me , sah , who is kicking , sah ? "
asked <name> , respectfully .
" semmel says he was made sick by what he ate . "
" huh , dat <unk> ! "
grunted <name> .
" he ai n't no <unk> at all , he ai n't ! "
and the cook turned away in disgust .
" it looks to me as if semmel was trying to make trouble all around , " said <name> grandon , when he and the captain and <name> talked the matter over .
" i never liked that man from the first time i clapped eyes on him , " came from <name> .
" he 's a sneak  and worse . "
" i shall watch him pretty closely after this , " said captain ponsberry .
" one discontented fellow like him can upset the whole ship if he sets out to do it . "
" they ca n't complain of the grub , " went on the first mate .
" it 's as good as on any merchantman , and better than the law requires . "
" i guess it was the <unk> that gave him the stomach ache , " said <name> , and this made the captain and grandon smile .
the next day when the sailors sat down to their dinner two or three of them sniffed suspiciously at the food they were eating .
" this do n't taste just right to me , " said shamhaven .
" the meat tastes decayed . "
" and the vegetables ai n't much better , " put in conroy ,  a sturdy <unk> , who was one of the best seamen on the schooner .
" dat dinner am <unk> , " cried <name> .
" i ai n't gwine to stand yere an' see you <unk> ' at it . "
" it certainly tastes a bit off , <name> , " put in <name> <name> .
" taste it yourself . "
the cook did so , and his face looked doubtful for a moment .
" guess dat needs a little salt an ' pepper , " he said , slowly .
it did not taste nearly as good as he had anticipated .
as there was nothing else to do , and they were hungry , the men ate the meal , grumbling to themselves as they did so .
<name> said but little and ate sparingly , and his example was followed by cal <name> .
the captain , grandon , and <name> ate in the cabin and the dinner served to them was first-class in every particular .
" guess <name> is spreading himself , just to show what he can do , " remarked <name> to the first mate , after he had finished his repast .
" it 's very good , <name> , " answered <name> grandon .
by the middle of the afternoon three of the men were complaining of feeling sick and all attributed their ailments to what they had eaten for dinner .
" <name> !
vat i tole you ? "
cried semmel .
" did n't i say de grub vos pad ?
not maybe you belief me , hey ? "
" i <name> n't stand for any more poor grub , " came from shamhaven .
" if i ca n't get good stuff i 'm going to the captain about it . "
the sickness of the hands worried captain ponsberry greatly and he opened up his medicine chest and gave them such remedies as he thought were best .
at supper time <name> was extra cautious in selecting and preparing the food .
nevertheless , the men who ate of it were suspicious and more than half the meal went to waste .
the captain was very thoughtful , but said little or nothing .
on the following day the wind died down utterly and it was exceedingly warm .
with nothing to do , the majority of the hands gathered at the bow to talk of matters in general , and the food in particular .
semmel and peterson were of the number , and both did all in their power to magnify the outrage , as they termed it .
" der captain do n't haf any right to gif us such grub , " said semmel .
" it vos against der law . "
" on some ships there would be a mutiny over this , " added peterson .
<name> overheard a part of the conversation and it set him thinking .
<name> striker also grew suspicious .
" unless i am mistaken , this is some of semmel 's work , " said <name> to the old tar .
" he is doing his level best to make trouble on the ship . "
" well , he better mind his business , " grumbled <name> .
" i do n't reckon the captain <name> stand fer any underhanded work . "
without appearing to do so , <name> continued to keep his eyes on semmel , and about an hour before dinner he saw the bearded sailor approach the cook 's galley and look inside .
<name> was below , getting a case of canned goods .
with a swift movement , semmel stepped into the galley , raised the lid of a big pot full of stew that was on the stove , and sprinkled something over the food .
then he hurried out and sneaked forward once more .
" the rascal ! "
murmured <name> .
" so this is his game .
i wonder what he put into that pot ? "
for the moment the young second mate thought to confront semmel and demand an explanation .
then he changed his mind and hurried for the cabin , to tell the news to captain ponsberry .
chapter v signs of a mutiny " i 've found out something important , captain ponsberry , " said <name> , as he entered the cabin .
" i now know what 's the matter with the grub . "
to all salt-water sailors food is grub and nothing else .
" well , what is the matter with it ? "
questioned the master of the columbia , quickly .
" it 's being doctored , that 's what 's the matter . "
" doctored ? "
" yes , sir ,  doctored by semmel , too . "
" <name> you explain what you mean , <name> ? "
demanded the captain , intensely interested .
" i just saw that rascal go into the cook 's galley .
<name> was n't there , and semmel took the lid off of a big pot on the stove and sprinkled something inside . "
" what ! "
captain ponsberry leaped to his feet " are you certain of this ? "
he demanded .
" i am  for i saw it with my own eyes . "
" what was that stuff he put into the pot ? "
" i do n't know . "
" did he touch anything else ? "
" no .
he was in a tremendous hurry and was n't in the galley more than a minute at the most . "
" the scoundrel ! "
captain ponsberry clenched his fists .
" <name> , you are positive you are making no mistake ? "
" i saw the thing done just as i told you .
the stuff was in a bit of white paper .
when he went forward he threw the paper overboard . "
" did anybody else see this ? "
" i do n't think so .
but   " at that moment came a knock on the cabin door and <name> striker appeared .
" excuse me , sir , " he said , touching his cap .
" but i 've got something important to report . "
" what is it , striker ? "
" i <name> see that air semmel go in and out o ' the cook 's galley . "
" that is just what i am reporting ! "
cried <name> .
" did you see what he did , <name> ? "
" no .
he was n't in there only a minit .
it looked suspicious to me , though  with all hands gittin ' sick from the grub . "
" this is all the evidence i want , " said captain ponsberry .
" we 'll soon make an end of this .
<name> , send semmel to me . "
the young second mate left the cabin with <name> and both hurried toward the bow , where semmel and peterson were conversing in low tones .
" the captain wants to see you at once , " said <name> to the bearded sailor .
his tone was so sharp it made semmel start .
" vat he <unk> ? "
he queried .
" go and find out for yourself . "
" maybe you git me in <unk> , hey ? "
and the bearded sailor scowled .
" i reckon as how you 're gittin ' yourself into trouble , " drawled <name> , dryly .
" you keep your <unk> shut ! "
cried semmel .
" i no talk to you , no ! "
" the captain wants you to report ; are you going to do so or not ? "
demanded <name> .
" sure i go , " answered semmel , with a toss of his head , and he slouched toward the stern .
his manner was so aggressive that <name> picked up a <unk> pin before following him .
captain ponsberry had just appeared on deck .
he had armed himself with a short club ,  a sure sign to those who knew him that something unusual was in the wind .
his face was stern and forbidding , and all hands gathered around to see what was the trouble .
" semmel , i want to have a talk with you , " he said , in a loud voice , as the bearded sailor came up .
to this the sailor nodded but did not answer .
" i want to know what you were doing in the cook 's galley a short while ago . "
" de cook 's galley ? "
the sailor acted as if he was puzzled .
" i no go by de galley , captain . "
" you were in the galley and you put something into the <unk> .
what was it ? "
thundered captain ponsberry .
" tell me the truth , or i may take it into my head to break every bone in your body ! "
and he shook his club in the sailor 's face .
" i put noddings in de pot , " cried semmel .
" i no go in de galley  i no been in de galley two , tree days .
it is a lie ! "
" i saw you go in , " came from <name> .
" and so did i , " added <name> .
" and i saw you <unk> something into the pot . "
" what , did dat <unk> <unk> put <unk> in <name> <unk> ' ? "
shrieked <name> , who had come up .
" oh ,  yo '  yo '   " " never mind , <name> , i 'll attend to this , " interrupted the captain .
" yes , sah , but dat <unk>   " " never mind now  fall back there , " added the captain , and the cook fell back , but shook his fist at semmel .
" i not in de galley , " reiterated the bearded sailor .
" <name> an' striker no tell de truth . "
" it is true , " cried <name> .
" thet 's so , an ' you ca n't squirm out o ' it , " broke in <name> .
" i saw ye as plain as day . "
" i want to know what you put into that <unk> ? "
continued captain ponsberry .
" i no go near de galley .
i   " " i know you went into the galley and i know you put something into the stew .
for the last time i ask you , what was it ? "
for reply ostag semmel simply shrugged his shoulders .
" are you going to tell me the truth ? "
" i reckon the truth ai n't in him , " grumbled <name> , under his breath .
" i say noddings more , " came sourly from the bearded sailor .
" put that man in irons , " commanded captain ponsberry , turning quickly to <name> and grandon .
" if he wo n't talk now , perhaps he 'll talk after he has spent a day in the brig . "
" vat !
you put me in irons ! "
shrieked semmel .
" you no got right to do dat , no ! "
" have n't i ? "
answered captain ponsberry , in a voice that cut like a whip .
" i 'd like to see anybody dispute over it .
<name> , <name> , do as i command . "
" yes , sir , " answered <name> , and ran off to get a pair of handcuffs while <name> grandon stationed himself beside ostag semmel , <unk> pin in hand .
" you no mak me a prisoner ! "
fumed the bearded sailor .
" you got no right ! "
he continued to rave , saying that it was a plot against him , because he had been the first to complain about the vile food served to the hands ; that he had not been near the galley and that the captain , grandon , and <name> knew it .
he even appealed to the other sailors to stand by him , and several came forward to argue with captain ponsberry .
but the master of the schooner was obstinate and would not listen .
" i know what i am doing , men , " he said , quickly but firmly .
" he is a scoundrel and a spell in the brig <name> do him good .
after this i reckon you 'll find the grub all right . "
" i no like  " began peterson , once more .
" you shut up , peterson , or i 'll put you in the brig with semmel , " cut in the captain , and peterson fell back with the rest , but with a brow that was dark and <unk> .
by this time <name> had returned with the handcuffs and despite the resistance he offered , ostag semmel was made a prisoner .
then the first and the second mates led him to the schooner 's brig ,  a narrow , <unk> room in the bow of the boat , usually used for storing lanterns and oil .
the smell in the closet  for it was nothing else  was far from pleasant , and a day in the brig usually made a prisoner repent and promise to do better .
" i mak trouble for dis ! "
growled semmel , as the door was closed and bolted on him .
" i mak trouble , yes !
you got no right to do dis , no ! "
" and you have n't any right to doctor the grub , " answered <name> , and then he and grandon walked away .
" that fellow is a first-class villain , to my way of reasoning , " was the first mate 's comment .
" i believe he 'd do almost anything to get square for this . "
after ostag semmel had been placed in the brig captain ponsberry called all hands to him once more and related what <name> and <name> had seen .
the stew was inspected , but nothing suspicious could be seen about it .
" if any of you want to try that stew you may do so , " said the captain .
" of course , if semmel did n't touch it there can be nothing in it that can hurt you . "
but all , even to peterson , declined to even taste the food .
it was one thing to think semmel innocent but quite another to run the risk of being made sick or poisoned .
in the end the stew was dumped overboard and <name> prepared an entirely new dinner for all hands .
" you must keep close watch on all of the men , " said the captain to <name> and grandon , when quietness had been restored .
" semmel was the worst of the lot , but i do not like the way peterson and one or two others are acting . "
" i do n't see what they can do , " answered <name> .
" they might start a mutiny , " came from the first mate .
" would they dare go as far as that ? "
" sometimes sailors get strange notions , and the old <name> himself can't stop them , " said captain ponsberry .
" a thing that in itself doesn't amount to much <name> start them off , and they 'll imagine that everything is going wrong .
when i was a lad , on board the <name> <name> , captain snapper , we had a mutiny just because the coffee was n't right . "
" yes , and i can remember that they had a mutiny on the old brig chesterfield because captain roe 's wife brought a <unk> yellow cat on board , " added grandon .
" not a man would hoist a sail until that <unk> was put ashore .
and when , two months later , the brig lost her foremast in a <name> , the sailors said it was on account of that same cat , she having scratched the mast before she was taken away ! "
" well , i <name> we do n't have a mutiny , " said <name> .
" i 'd like to suggest something , captain ponsberry , " he went on , to the master of the columbia .
" fire ahead , <name> . "
" you know we can trust <name> striker .
why not have him report just what the other hands are doing ? "
" that 's an idea , and i <name> act on it .
yes , i 'd trust striker as quick as i 'd trust you .
if there is to be trouble we certainly want to know of it as soon as possible , " concluded the captain .
chapter <name> the fight for the ship the day to follow was <name> , and contrary to expectations , it passed quietly .
as there was hardly any wind , the old columbia made slow progress , and the sailors had little or nothing to do .
as was his usual habit , <name> read his bible , and captain ponsberry held a short church service , which less than half the crew attended .
" it 's plain to see that the men are sulky , " said <name> grandon , towards evening .
" we are certain to hear something from them shortly . "
<name> had been told to report anything unusual , but it was not until after dark that he sought out captain ponsberry .
" i ai n't got much to say , " said the old tar .
" but to my mind peterson , <unk> , and shamhaven are doin ' a powerful lot of <unk> ' .
more'n that , i saw peterson cleaning up a pistol he 's got . "
" are any of the other hands armed ? "
" i ai n't seen no other <unk> , " answered <name> .
the captain had expected to interview semmel once more , but found the fellow so surly he gave up the attempt .
as the brig was so hot and uncomfortable , the master of the schooner had the door fixed so it could be left open several inches , with a chain at the bolt to keep it from going further .
at four o'clock monday morning peterson came on duty , followed by shamhaven and some others .
all made their way to the bow and began to talk in a low but <name> fashion .
then peterson went below , to where semmel was still confined in the brig .
" we are ready to move now , " said he , in russian .
" what do you think ? "
" let me out and i <name> show you what i think , " growled ostag semmel .
" the captain is a dog  and grandon and <name> are dogs , too ! "
peterson was prepared to unlock the chain which held the brig door and did so .
then he handed a pistol to the russian .
" the captain and <name> are in their staterooms , " said peterson .
" only grandon is on deck , with <name> and with the men we can trust to help us . "
" we ca n't trust <name> . "
" i know that . "
" where is striker ? "
" asleep in his berth . "
but on this score <name> peterson was mistaken .
<name> had pretended to go to sleep , but he was now in a corner on deck , watching with keen eyes all that was occurring .
presently he saw semmel in company with peterson hurry towards the bow , and he felt that the time for action had arrived .
" hi , mr .
grandon ! "
he called out , running up to the first mate .
" what is it , striker ? "
" they 've released semmel and they are arming themselves . "
" you do n't say ! "
<name> grandon was stunned for the instant .
" tell the captain and <name> of this at once ! "
" aye , aye , sir ! "
rushing down the companionway , <name> entered the cabin and knocked on the door of captain ponsberry 's stateroom .
" wake up , captain ! "
he called , loudly .
" wake up !
there is going to be trouble putty quick , to my way o ' thinkin ' ! "
" what has gone wrong now ? "
demanded the master of the columbia , as he hurried into his clothes and armed himself .
" where is grandon ? "
" on deck ; he sent me to tell you .
they have set semmel free and some of 'em are arming themselves . "
" a mutiny ! "
roared captain ponsberry .
" striker , you 'll stand by me , of course ? "
" that i <name> , sir  to the end . "
" good .
i know <name> <name> do the same .
do you know anything about the others ? "
" i think you can count on <name> the cook . "
" what of <name> ? "
" he 's so <unk> i do n't know what he 'll do , " answered striker .
by this time <name> was out of his stateroom .
with his door ajar he had heard all that had been said .
" oh , <name> , do you think they 'll try to seize the ship ? "
he gasped .
" do n't know what they 'll do .
they 're a plumb crazy lot , " growled the old tar .
" it was a mistake to take such fellers as semmel and peterson and shamhaven aboard . "
" that is true , but when <unk> and larson got sick and went to the hospital at manila i had to get somebody , " answered captain ponsberry .
he brought out several pistols .
" here , <name> , take one of these , and a cutlass , too , and you , striker , can arm yourself likewise . "
there was no time to answer , for the master of the schooner was already striding through the cabin in the direction of the companionway .
an instant later came a yell from the deck , followed by heavy footsteps and then the report of a pistol .
" drive dem to de cabin ! "
came in the voice of semmel .
" drive dem along , kvick ! "
and then followed another yell and the sounds of half a dozen blows .
" below there ! "
came in <name> grandon 's voice .
" help !
help ! "
" i 'm coming ! "
called up captain ponsberry .
" do n't you dare to step on deck , captain ! "
yelled down the voice of shamhaven .
" do n't you dare to do it ! "
and the sailor appeared , pistol in hand , at the top of the companionway .
" shamhaven , what does this mean ? "
demanded the master of the columbia .
" it means that we have taken possession of the ship , that 's what it means , " came from <unk> .
" of you come up here , you maybe git killed , " put in ostag semmel .
" you stay down dare , you hear ? "
and then , as the captain started to mount the stairs , he threw down a <unk> pin .
in the semi-darkness the captain did not see the object , and it struck him on the top of the head , rendering him partly unconscious .
<name> and <name> were close behind their leader and both were alarmed to see him go down , uttering a deep groan as he did so .
" is he killed ? "
questioned the young second mate .
" i do n't know , " was the old tar 's response .
" shall we go up ? "
" keep back there ! "
was the call from above .
" put a step on those stairs and it <name> be the worse for you ! "
at that moment came a cry from cal <name> .
the boatswain had been attacked from behind and was given no chance to defend himself .
then came a roar from <name> , who came rushing toward the companionway as if all the demons of the deep were behind him .
" <unk> me !
<unk> me ! "
he screamed .
" da is gwine to pirate de ship !
<unk> me ! "
and then he came plunging down headlong , directly on top of <name> , <name> , and the prostrate captain .
this unexpected coming of <name> sent the young second mate and the old tar flat on captain ponsberry , and for the moment there was a struggle all around .
in the meantime some sailors on the deck began to drag a heavy hatch toward the stairs .
soon this was placed in position , and then those below were virtually prisoners .
" oh my , <unk> me ! "
groaned <name> once more , as he managed to get on his feet in the cabin , followed by <name> and <name> .
" do n't you let dem swing me from de <unk> ! "
" <name> , where are grandon and <name> ? "
demanded <name> .
" i dunno , sah  dead , i guess , " answered the cook .
" oh , dis am de <unk> <unk> wot i <unk> heard tell ob ! "
he added , <unk> , and wrung his hands .
the lantern in the cabin was turned up and <name> gave his attention once more to captain ponsberry , who was now opening his eyes .
" oh , my head ! "
came with a shiver .
" my head ! "
" i 'm glad they did n't kill you , " said <name> , kindly .
" <name> , help me <name> him into the cabin .
we 'll put him on the couch . "
this was done , and they did what they could to make the master of the schooner comfortable .
but it was a good half-hour before captain ponsberry could sit up and do any rational thinking .
on deck all had become suddenly quiet .
occasionally those below could hear a footstep near the companionway , showing that one or more of the mutineers were on guard .
the hatch shut off the view on deck , and the windows in the ceiling of the cabin were also boarded over from the outside .
" they have us like rats in a trap , " said <name> , bitterly .
" and for all we know <name> and grandon are both dead , " returned <name> striker , soberly .
" i must say , lad , we seem to be in a bad way and no mistake . "
" dey 'll throw us overboard , i know dey <name> ! "
groaned <name> , who was almost white with terror .
" i <unk> see sech <unk> in all <name> life ! "
to fight the mutineers further was , just then , out of the question , and <name> turned his attention again to captain ponsberry .
at last the captain seemed fully to comprehend what had occurred .
he once more moved toward the companionway , pistol in hand .
" you ca n't get out that way , sir , " said <name> .
" they have placed the fore hatch over the stairs . "
" and they are armed , too , " put in <name> .
" be careful , sir , or they'll shoot you down . "
" and this on my own ship ! "
came bitterly from the master of the columbia .
" that is what i get for treating the dogs better than they deserve .
where are grandon and <name> ? "
" either shot down or taken prisoners .
they called for help , and that was the last we heard of them . "
" and are all the others in this dastardly plot ? "
" i reckon they are , " answered <name> .
" them foreigners , semmel an' peterson , must have stirred 'em up powerfully . "
still weak from the blow received , captain ponsberry sank down once more on the cabin couch .
there was a lump as big as a walnut on the top of his head , and he had <name> bathe it with water and then with <unk> , which made it a trifle more comfortable .
a short while later came a sudden wild song from the deck of the schooner , followed by a <unk> of glasses .
" they are treating themselves to <unk> , " said <name> .
" i suppose , now they have the run of things , they 'll drink all they want of the stuff . "
" more than likely , " returned the captain .
" well , it is their turn just now  perhaps before long it <name> be my turn ! "
and he smiled significantly .
chapter vii the mutineers in possession as my old readers know , both captain ponsberry and <name> striker were yankees to the backbone , and it galled them exceedingly to see the schooner in the hands of a number of mutineers , and especially foreigners .
" we 've got to git the ship back , no two ways on it , " growled the old tar .
" captain , i 'm willin ' to fight to the end , if ye give the word . "
" and i 'll fight , too , " said <name> , promptly .
" do n't you go fo ' to fight dem <unk> ! "
whined <name> .
" yo ' <name> all be killed suah ! "
" i would like to know what has become of grandon and <name> , " came from captain ponsberry .
" as we stand now , we are but four to seven or eight .
if we could get grandon and <name> to aid us we would be six against them . "
" perhaps all the hands are not in the mutiny , " suggested <name> .
" why not try to sound them ? "
" i was thinking of doing that . "
a little later captain ponsberry called up the companionway .
at first nobody paid any attention to him , but presently the hatch was shoved aside a few inches and ostag semmel looked down .
behind him was shamhaven .
" semmel , what does this mean ? "
asked the captain , as calmly as he could .
" it means dat ve haf de ship , " replied the russian , with a grin .
" you are carrying matters with a very high hand .
where are grandon and <name> ? "
" i not tell you dat . "
" we had a right to mutiny , " said shamhaven .
" the grub was n't fit to eat and was getting worse every day . "
" that 's a tale gotten up for the occasion , shamhaven , and you know it .
semmel doctored the food to make you dissatisfied . "
" well , we do n't think so , " grumbled the sailor .
" i do n't think so , and <unk> and the others do n't either . "
" has <name> <name> joined you ? "
" certainly he has , " was shamhaven 's ready reply , but his look belied his words .
" ve are all <unk> to stick <unk> , " said semmel .
" you might as vell gif up  der sooner der <unk> for you ! "
" i do n't propose to give up , you rascal . "
" to n't you call me a rascals , no ! "
shouted ostag semmel .
" i vos now der captains , yes , do you hear ?
captain semmel ! "
" bosh ! "
put in <name> striker , in disgust .
" why ye ai n't fit to be the skipper <unk> a <unk> ! "
" if you try to navigate the ship you 'll sink her on the rocks , " put in <name> .
" you had better consider what you are doing , shamhaven , " went on the master of the columbia .
" remember , if i regain possession of the schooner i can make it go hard with you . "
" you no get dare schooner again , not much ! "
came from peterson , who had just come up , followed by <name> <name> .
" <name> , are you in this ? "
demanded the captain .
" if you are , i must confess i did n't think it of you . "
" i ai n't goin ' to eat poor grub , " answered <name> , lamely .
" the grub is all right and you know it .
it was doctored up by semmel , and i   " " you stop dat talk ! "
roared semmel , and then he added : " maybe you gif in after you are goot an ' hungry , hey ? "
" what , do you want to starve us out ? "
cried <name> .
" you see  chust <unk> ! "
answered the russian , and with this the hatch was again put in place and the conference came to an end .
captain ponsberry was fairly boiling with wrath , but even so he realized that <name> is often the better part of valor .
" there is no use of trying a rush to the deck , " he said .
" those rascals would surely shoot us down .
just now some of them are in the humor for anything . "
" perhaps we can do something to-night , " suggested <name> .
" they talk about starving us out , " said <name> .
" ai n't there nothin ' to eat here ? "
an inspection was made of the cabin pantry , which brought to light some preserves , some pickles , a pot of cheese , and a tin of fancy crackers .
" about enough for one meal , " said captain ponsberry , grimly .
" and a pretty slim one at that , " added <name> .
" but i say , captain , " he added , suddenly , " is n't there a door leading from the back of the pantry down into the hold ? "
" there was once  but i had it nailed up years ago , for we never used it . "
" if we can open that , we might get something from the hold . "
" going to eat machinery ? "
demanded <name> .
" no  canned goods , <name> ; i know <name> had some placed there , for he did n't have room in his <unk> . "
" dat am a <unk> ' , " put in the cook .
" i'se got lots ob <unk> in dat dar hold . "
" then that settles the starving question , " said captain ponsberry .
" i've got a small saw and a hammer down here somewhere .
we can use them on the door . "
" and that gives me another idea , " went on <name> .
" the hatch covering over the companionway belongs to the fore hatch .
if we can reach that opening from here , why ca n't we steal on deck when we get the chance and try to make the mutineers prisoners ? "
" eureka ! "
shouted <name> .
" that 's the talk , <name> .
fer your years you've got a wonderfully long head on ye .
we 'll make 'em prisoners or <name> 'em overboard ! "
" the idea is worth considering , " said the captain .
" but we must be careful . "
a search was made and the hammer , small saw , and also a chisel were found .
then they cleaned out the pantry , took down several shelves , and thus uncovered the small door which had been nailed up .
" do n't make any noise , or they 'll suspect that we are up to something , " said captain ponsberry .
" let <name> rattle some dishes , " said <name> , and while he and <name> worked on the door , the cook began to handle the dishes in such a rough manner that several were broken .
he also tried to sing a couple of verses of his favorite song , " my gal <name> ! "
but his voice was so shaky that the effort was , artistically , a failure , although it added to the noise , which was all that was desired .
" they 're pretty happy down there , " said <name> to shamhaven , as he listened to the sounds .
" oh , they 're putting on a front , " growled shamhaven .
" they 'll sing a different tune when their stomachs are empty . "
" i do n't know about this mutiny , " went on the <unk> sailor , nervously .
" oh , it 's all right and you need n't to worry , <name> .
if we stick together we 'll make a couple of thousand apiece out of this game . "
" but what shall we do if we fall in with a russian warship ? "
" semmel has that all fixed .
he 'll expose the captain and state that the columbia is carrying a cargo for the japanese government , and that he took possession in the name of the czar .
with this war on they wo n't ask too many questions so long as they can give the japs a black eye . "
" i see .
but supposing we fall in with a japanese warship ? "
" then semmel is going to turn the command over to me and i 'll tell them that the cargo was really meant for the japanese government but that captain ponsberry , just before we left manila , sold out to the russian agents and was going to <unk> .
i 'll add that we refused to go to the russian port after signing for nagasaki , and all of the men can back me up .
that <name> put the captain and his friends in <unk> and give us some prize money .
oh , we 'll come out ahead , do n't you worry , " concluded shamhaven , confidently .
the day passed slowly and the mutineers held several meetings , to settle upon just what they were going to do .
but all had been drinking more than was good for them and the conferences ended in nothing but talk .
semmel was the accepted leader , but it was plain to see that shamhaven objected strongly to playing a secondary part , and peterson also wanted a large " finger in the pie . "
as they worked with care , it was a good hour and a half before <name> and <name> managed to take down the door leading into the hold .
even when this was done they found on the other side several heavy cases of machinery almost impossible to budge .
" we can pry those out of the way , " said the captain .
" a foot or so <name> do it , " returned <name> .
" then i think i can crawl over the top . "
they continued the work , and a little later the young second mate was able to squeeze his way to the top of the cargo in that vicinity .
" be careful , <name> , " warned the captain .
" if a case should shift with the ship you might get a crushed leg .
you had better take a candle along . "
" i <name> , sir . "
<name> was as anxious to get into the hold as the young second mate , and he too squeezed his tall , lank form through the opening .
guided by the faint light of the candle , they crawled over a number of cases of machinery and war goods until they <name> close to the middle of the ship .
" here we are ! "
cried <name> , in a low voice , and pointed to some cases of canned goods .
" beans , corn , tomatoes , salt pork , condensed milk  we wo n't starve just yet , <name> . "
" an ' here are some barrels o ' flour , " added the old tar .
" no , they can't starve us nohow now . "
they had brought the chisel and hammer along , and with extra caution opened some of the cases .
taking with them all the goods they could <name> , they returned to the cabin .
" this is splendid ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" with this stuff on hand we can hold the cabin indefinitely . "
" how is i gwine to cook ? "
questioned <name> .
" over the two lanterns , <name> .
it <name> be slow work , but our time is our own .
luckily there are pots and tins in the pantry . "
" all right , sah . "
" of course , i am hoping that we shall not have to stay here long , " went on the captain .
" but it is best to be prepared . "
that those on deck might not see the cooking going on , one of the staterooms was cleaned out and <name> went to work in this .
in the meantime semmel called down the companionway once more .
" are you gettin ' hungry ? "
he asked .
" tell him yes , " whispered <name> .
" why ? "
questioned the captain , in an equally low tone .
" then he 'll think we are getting ready to come to terms and he won't watch us so closely . "
" i see . "
captain ponsberry raised his voice .
" yes , we are hungry , " he called up .
" what are you going to send us , something good ? "
" ve send noddings .
maybe you talk business soon , hey ? "
continued the rascally russian .
" perhaps . "
" how soon ? "
" well , perhaps to-morrow morning . "
" not before <name> , hey ? "
" no . "
" all right den ; you can go on an ' starve so long ! "
growled ostag semmel , and went away .
a moment later he met shamhaven .
" what did he say ? "
asked the latter , anxiously .
" he comes to terms to-morrow ! "
answered the russian , triumphantly .
chapter viii turning the tables the meal which <name> prepared put all in the cabin in better humor , and as soon as it was over a council of war was held .
it was decided to wait until darkness had set in , and then try to gain the deck of the ship by way of the fore hatch .
in the meantime the door to the companionway was to be locked and barred , so that the mutineers could not attack them very well from that direction , should a running fight ensue .
as <name> would be of no use in a struggle he was delegated to remain in the cabin , to make as much noise as possible , singing and talking to himself , so that the mutineers might not suspect what was taking place .
each member of the party armed himself both with a pistol and a cutlass , and <name> led the way as before , candle in hand .
it was easy for <name> to follow him , but rather difficult for the captain , who was more portly .
" reckon as how ye should n't have eaten so much , captain , " chuckled the old tar , as he helped captain ponsberry through a particularly narrow place .
" true , striker , " was the answer .
" but you be careful that you do n't slip into some slit between the cases and go out of sight . "
they soon gained the spot where the canned goods had been found .
they had now to climb over some machinery that reached nearly to the top of the hold , and then over a varied collection of boxes and barrels and bags .
on the bags lay some of the old sails of the ship and several coils of discarded rope .
they were just approaching the open fore hatch when they saw a rope ladder let down .
instantly <name> uttered a warning and put out the light .
" somebody is coming down , " he whispered .
it was the sailor <name> , who had been sent to get some canned goods for cooking purposes .
he came down the rope ladder with a lantern slung over one arm .
" we 'll make him a prisoner ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" and let us do it as quietly as we can , so as not to disturb those on deck . "
the others understood and crouched back in the darkness .
then , as <name> passed them , the captain caught him from the back and <name> clapped a hand over the fellow 's mouth .
" oh ! "
spluttered <name> , but that was as far as he got .
" not a word !
not a sound , <name> ! "
said captain ponsberry , earnestly .
the sailor understood , and being a craven at heart he almost collapsed .
it was an easy matter to take one of the old ropes and tie his hands behind him .
then captain ponsberry confronted the mutineer , making a liberal exhibition of his pistol as he did so .
" <name> , answer me truthfully , " said the master of the columbia .
" are you all in this mutiny or not ?
do n't speak above a whisper . "
" i ai n't in it ! "
whined <name> .
" they dragged me in , they did .
i ain't kicking about grub , or nothing ! "
" are all the others in it ? "
" kind of , yes .
<unk> did n't care much to go in .
guess he wish he was out of it now . "
" what has become of grandon and <name> ? "
" both of 'em are prisoners in the brig . "
" are they wounded ? "
" not much .
grandon had his thumb cut and <name> got a kick in the back that lamed him . "
" is anybody guarding them ? "
" i guess not .
all of 'em have got to drinking again .
say , captain , let me out of this fix and i 'll never go against you again , never , " continued <name> , earnestly .
" we 'll see about that later , " was the grim reply .
" captain ponsberry , i have a scheme , " put in <name> , and he <name> the master of the ship to one side .
" <name> is about the same build as myself .
let me take his coat and cap and go on deck and down to the brig .
if i can release grandon and <name> we 'll be sure to knock out the mutiny in no time . "
" it 's a dangerous game , <name> . "
" oh , please let me do it ! "
pleaded the young second mate .
the hazard was one which appealed to him strongly .
the matter was talked over for a few minutes and it was decided to let <name> have his way .
<name> was soon stripped of his coat and the young second mate donned the garment .
then he took the mutineer 's cap and pulled it as far over his brow as possible and turned up the coat collar .
" i 'll leave the lantern here , " he said , and a second later was mounting the rope ladder slowly and cautiously .
with his head on a level with the deck <name> paused to reconnoiter the situation .
he knew exactly how dangerous his mission was and that he was running the risk of being shot .
but his life in our navy had made him bold , and seeing nobody in sight , he leaped out on deck , and hurried with all speed to the ladder leading to the brig .
soon he was in front of the barred door .
" grandon !
<name> ! "
he called , softly .
" hullo , who 's that ? "
came in the voice of the first mate .
" it is i , <name> .
is <name> there ? "
" yes .
where did you come from ? "
" the cabin . "
<name> <unk> the door .
" are you hurt ? "
" not much .
how are you ? "
" i am all right , and so are the captain and <name> striker .
they are in the hold , ready to come on deck .
we have made <name> a prisoner . "
" good enough , " came from the boatswain .
" the rascals !
they ought all to walk the plank ! "
he added , vehemently .
the two men had their hands tied behind them , but it was an easy matter for <name> to liberate them .
then each provided himself with a <unk> pin , and all three of the party stole to the deck .
from the forecastle and the cook 's galley came loud talking , showing that the mutineers were making themselves at home .
one man was trying to do some cooking .
" what 's keeping <name> so long ? "
he demanded of the others .
nobody knew , and one of the crowd , the sailor named <unk> , volunteered to look the missing one up .
" let us follow him to the hatch , " whispered <name> .
" perhaps we can make him a prisoner . "
" right you are , " answered <name> grandon .
with caution they came up behind the man , and just as <unk> leaned over the open hatchway , they caught him tightly .
" keep silent , <unk> ! "
said grandon .
" keep silent , or we 'll throw you overboard . "
" stop ! "
roared the mutineer .
" help !
<unk>   " he got no further , for raising his <unk> pin , <name> brought it down on the mutineer 's head .
<unk> had been the one to lame the <unk> back and the latter had not forgotten it .
over went the fellow and sank down as if dead .
" drop him into the hold , " ordered grandon , and this was done just as captain ponsberry and <name> striker appeared at the foot of the rope ladder .
" another , eh ? "
said the master of the columbia .
" good enough !
how are you , <name> ?
how are you , <name> ? "
" we 're ready to fight 'em , " answered the first mate .
" come on !
they've got so much liquor aboard they ca n't do much to us ! "
" be careful , i do n't want anybody shot if it can be avoided , " responded captain ponsberry .
" i think it would be a good plan to dump them all into the hold , " said <name> .
" then we could nail up that pantry door , put the hatch into place , and keep them at our <name> . "
" if the plan <name> work , it 's a good one , " answered the captain .
one after another they came out on deck , leaving <name> and <unk> in the hold .
they found the mutineers equally divided between the galley and the forecastle .
the only man in charge of the schooner was conroy , who was at the wheel .
as they advanced upon the forecastle they saw semmel come out , accompanied by peterson .
" there are the <unk> ! "
cried captain ponsberry , and rushing up to them he exclaimed : " surrender , you rascals ! "
and he aimed his pistol , while the others also raised their weapons .
the russian and his companion were taken completely by surprise , and before they could draw any weapons of their own it was too late .
grandon tripped one up and fell upon him , and then <name> and <name> tripped up the other .
there was a brief scuffle , the exchange of several blows which did little damage , and in a trice semmel and peterson were thrown down into the hold bodily , and the ladder was hauled up out of their reach .
" put that hatch over the opening , " cried captain ponsberry to <name> .
" and then go into the cabin pantry and nail up that door .
be quick about it , or they may get out ! "
" aye , aye , sir ! "
cried the young second mate , and ran off with all speed .
the hatch was large and heavy , but the excitement lent him strength and he dragged it forward and threw it over the hatchway .
" stop dat ! "
roared semmel , in a drunken voice , but <name> paid no attention .
his next movement was toward the cabin .
" do n't yo ' tech me ! "
roared <name> , in alarm .
" oh , it am yo ' ! "
he added , as he recognized <name> .
" how am de battle gwine ? "
" we 've got 'em on the run  four are prisoners in the hold , " was <unk> reply .
" get me that box of nails , <name>  i must put that door back as it was ! "
" yes , sah ; yes , sah ! "
answered the cook , eagerly , and brought forth the nails in question .
then he helped to put the door into place , and held it while <name> nailed the barrier .
the job was just completed when the young second mate heard voices from the hold .
" hi , dare , you let us out , " came from peterson .
" ve vill mak it right , yes ! "
" you keep quiet , " ordered <name> , and would say no more .
against the door he and <name> placed several trunks and boxes taken from the staterooms opening off of the cabin .
during this time the party led by captain ponsberry had attacked the balance of the mutineers .
there was a brief fight and shamhaven got a cutlass cut on the knee .
but then the men surrendered , and one after another was made to drop down into the hold , and the hatch was shut and <unk> down .
the only man who was not thus made a prisoner was conroy , who begged at once to be forgiven .
" they got me to drink , captain , " he pleaded .
" i did n't know what i was doing .
forgive it , and i 'll be the best man you ever had on board . "
" can i depend upon you , conroy ? "
asked captain ponsberry , sternly .
" you can , sir  i give you my word on it . "
" you wo n't try to help the mutineers ? "
" no , sir ; no , sir ! "
" very well then , i 'll try you .
but , remember , if you try any dirty work it <name> go hard with you .
now tell me , was <name> in favor of this mutiny ? "
" no , sir , he was not .
semmel forced him into it . "
" what of the others .
who were the <unk> ? "
" semmel and peterson and shamhaven .
the others did n't want to do anything but complain about the grub , " answered conroy , and then told the particulars of the mutiny from beginning to end .
chapter ix close to a <unk> it was decided to leave the mutineers in the hold undisturbed until morning .
this done , those who had been hurt in the scrimmage had their wounds attended to , and then <name> was set to work to prepare a good meal for all the loyal party .
the galley was in a state of disorder , but this counted for nothing , and <name> soon had matters straightened out .
after so much excitement nobody thought of retiring .
<name> was stationed over the fore hatch , to give warning of any attempt on the part of the mutineers to regain their <name> .
he was armed and he threatened to " blow the hull head off " of anybody who dared to show himself or make a noise .
as a consequence the mutineers did nothing .
two made their way to the <unk> door , but finding they could not open it , gave up the attempt as a bad job .
as a punishment for his misdeeds conroy was kept at the wheel during the whole of the night .
he was willing enough to do the extra work if only the captain would forgive him for his actions .
the master of the ship questioned him closely , and in the end reached the conclusion that only semmel , peterson , and shamhaven were the leaders in the attempt to seize the ship and that the others had followed after them like so many sheep .
" i am glad to hear this , " he said to grandon and <name> .
" i think after i read them a strong lecture they 'll behave themselves . "
" but we shall have to watch 'em closely , " said the first mate .
" what <name> you do with semmel , peterson , and shamhaven ? "
asked <name> .
" put them in irons and keep them there until the end of the trip .
when we reach nagasaki they can take their choice of leaving or of being kicked off the ship .
if they raise a row i 'll hand them over to the authorities . "
" you ought to have them locked up . "
" true , lad ; but with this war on hand the courts wo n't want to bother with such a case . "
it was not until nine o'clock in the morning that captain ponsberry had the forward hatch raised once more .
those below were almost dying for fresh air and water .
" i want <name> to come up , " he said .
" ca n't we have some water ? "
demanded shamhaven .
" yes , if you 'll behave yourselves , " was the short answer .
there was a babble of voices , but the master of the ship paid no attention .
each man who had been thrown below was unarmed , so there was no danger of any shooting .
presently <name> came up the rope ladder thrown to him , looking sheepish enough .
" what have you to say for yourself ? "
demanded the captain , when <name> threw himself on his knees .
" do n't count it against me , cap ' ! "
he groaned .
" i did n't want to go into it , i tell you !
i did n't want to go in ! "
" if i forgive you , <name> you give me your word to behave yourself ? "
" yes , sir ! "
" you wo n't do any more underhanded work ? "
" you can shoot me if i do , captain . "
" very well ; i 'll remember that .
now go forward and help put the ship in good order .
<name> , set him to work , and see that he does just what you tell him . "
and <name> went off , with the young second mate following , thanking his stars that he had not been swung to the <unk> , for mutiny on the high seas is a capital offense .
one by one the mutineers were allowed to come on deck , until only semmel , peterson , and shamhaven remained below .
those to come up pleaded to be forgiven and promised to obey orders in the future and let the captain run the ship to suit himself .
during the night , <unk> had had a bitter quarrel with semmel , and the russian appeared presently with a black eye and two of his front teeth loose .
he was promptly put in irons , and the <unk> of peterson and shamhaven followed .
" i have allowed the other men their <name> because you three led them into this affair , " said captain ponsberry to the trio of rascals .
" i intend to keep you in irons until the end of the trip . "
at this there was a loud complaint , and the three made all manner of protestations , but the master of the columbia was obdurate , and at last threatened to throw them into the hold again .
this quieted them for the time being , and after being given a square meal and a drink of water , they were marched off to the brig , which was cleaned of everything else for their accommodation .
fortunately for the columbia the weather remained fair , so that the loss of the prisoners was not felt when it came to handling the schooner .
those who had <unk> were only too glad to get back into captain ponsberry 's good graces and they did whatever was required with an alacrity which was as astonishing as it was gratifying .
they ate whatever was set before them , and soon reached the conclusion that the food was really better than they deserved .
" we were fools to follow semmel , " said <name> ; and conroy and some others fully agreed with him .
but though it now looked as if the men could be trusted , captain ponsberry determined to keep his eyes on them .
<name> was placed at the head of one watch and <name> at the head of the other , so that , with one or the other of the mates , the deck was always guarded by at least two persons that could be depended upon .
the captain had hoped for favorable breezes following the heavy storm , but these did not come , and day after day passed with the old columbia making slow progress toward nagasaki .
<unk> was passed during a bit of thick weather , so that nothing was seen of that island .
then the sun came out again , hotter than ever , so that <name> was glad to keep in the shade as much as possible .
" it 's not so exciting as it was a few days ago , " remarked <name> to <name> one day , when both were seated in the shade of the forecastle .
" i am glad that mutiny is at an end , " answered <name> .
" it 's a great wonder that somebody was n't killed or seriously wounded . "
" the men did n't have their hearts in the <unk> , thet 's why , <name> .
if they had really meant business  well , i reckon some of us would n't be here now to tell the tale . "
" i think semmel meant business . "
" yes , he 's a heap sight worse nor any o ' the others . "
" it was a mistake to take him on board .
i tell you , a captain ca n't be too careful who he puts in his forecastle . "
" well , you know the reason  those other hands gettin ' sick at manila .
but i can tell you , i 'd rather have a crew of americans any day . "
" they are hard to get . "
" true fer you . "
the old yankee tar heaved a sigh .
" the old days are gone , sure enough .
my !
my !
what times we used to have , when we 'd go out , every man <unk> ' every other man on the ship , an ' all about him , too !
then it was like a big family settin ' sail .
now , if you go on a new ship ye do n't know nobody an ' nobody knows nobody else . "
" i guess you expect to live and die a sailor , do n't you , <name> ? "
" do n't know but what i do , unless somebody leaves me money enough to live like a millionaire , " and the old tar grinned .
day after day passed and the columbia kept on her course , making as straight a passage for nagasaki as possible .
one day there would be a fair breeze and the next a dead calm .
" this is unusual weather for this quarter of the globe , " said captain ponsberry to <name> .
" like as not it <name> end in another hurricane . "
" in that case what <name> you do , release semmel and the others ? "
" i may release peterson and shamhaven , but not semmel , for he was the real ringleader . "
there were strong signs of a storm in the air that night , but they brought forth nothing , and on the following morning the sun came up as full and bright as before .
the breeze came by fits and starts , from first one direction and then another , and the man at the wheel had all he could do to keep the schooner to her course .
sails were shifted half a dozen times , but without making any improvement .
" the weather is certainly queer , " said grandon .
" puts me in mind of the time i was caught in a tidal wave in the south seas .
before the wave struck us we had just such <unk> . "
" i trust we do n't strike a tidal wave , " answered <name> .
" if it was high enough it might swamp us . "
" true ; but when you 're on the deep blue sea , lad , you 've got to take whatever comes , " replied the first mate , solemnly .
dinner was a quiet affair for all on board , and shortly after the repast <name> went to the forward deck , to have another chat with <name> .
while the two were talking they were joined by captain ponsberry ; and soon the three were conversing about old times once more .
" do you remember the swim we once took in the pacific ? "
said <name> to <name> .
" the time the <unk> smashed the boat and came after us ? "
" reckon i do , " was the yankee tar 's response .
" we had a lively swim fer it , did n't we ? "
" and the time we visited the island and you turned the turtles ? "
went on <name> .
" and do you remember that snake that chased us into the water ? "
" i do , <name> .
tell you what , we 've had our share of adventures .
when admiral <name>   what is it , captain ? "
<name> broke off short and looked at captain ponsberry inquiringly .
the master of the columbia was gazing over the port bow in an <name> , puzzled fashion .
" do you see that little black cloud , striker ? "
" i do , sir ! "
and now <name> became all attention and so did <name> .
" kind o ' funny lookin ' , ai n't it ? "
" it is odd , " answered the captain .
" do you see how it seems to be dancing around in the sky ? "
" is it a cloud ? "
questioned <name> .
" if so , i never saw its like before . "
" i 'll take a look at it through my glass , " went on the captain , and sent a sailor for the article .
the cloud came swiftly closer and they heard a most unusual roaring and hissing .
then of a sudden the cloud seemed to dip down into the sea .
when it came up , the waters of the ocean followed , and there loomed up before those on the ship a <unk> ten or fifteen feet thick .
" a <unk> ! "
cried half a dozen in concert .
" and a mighty powerful one , too , " said the captain .
" i trust it don't come this way . "
" it is coming this way ! "
yelled <name> .
" look !
look ! "
the young second mate was right , the <unk> appeared to be headed directly for the schooner .
but then it shot off to the westward , churning the water into a foam behind it .
" it 's going away , " murmured <name> , when once more the <unk> made a curve and then shot directly toward them .
it was off the port bow and less than a hundred feet away .
it looked as if the old columbia was surely doomed !
chapter x something about war and fighting ships " it 's going to strike the ship ! "
" it <name> cut us to pieces ! "
" throw the schooner over on the other tack ! "
these and several other cries rang out on the deck of the columbia .
all felt their hearts come up into their throats as the roaring , swirling mass of water came closer and closer , until the spray drenched them completely .
the ocean was <unk> into a white foam and the wind seemed to suck and blow in all directions at once .
but , just as it looked as if the schooner would be buried beneath a veritable mountain of water , the <unk> took another curve and slid away , along the side of the ship and off the stern .
the man at the wheel came close to being carried overboard by the deluge he received and the columbia bobbed up and down like a cork .
but in another moment the <unk> was an eighth of a mile distant .
" what a  a narrow escape , " faltered <name> , when he felt able to speak .
" i thought we were bound for the bottom sure ! "
" thet 's the closest i ever was to any <unk> , " came from <name> , as he wiped his wet brow .
" reckon we can thank providence we ai n't in davy jones ' locker this minit ! "
captain ponsberry did not say much , but kept his eyes fixed on the <unk> , which was making fantastic curves across the bosom of the pacific .
at times it was close by and then it would go half a mile or more away .
it was a fascinating scene , full of dread , and gave more than one <unk> a chill down his backbone .
" i wish it would go away completely , " went on <name> .
but this was not to be .
the <unk> kept within sight for a good half-hour , although it did not come near them again .
at last it grew less and less , off to the <unk> , and finally vanished altogether .
the glass was used in that direction , but nothing save a clear horizon could be located .
" we are clear of it at last , " said captain ponsberry , and breathed a long sigh of relief .
" <unk> are mighty dangerous things , " said grandon , after the scare was over .
" when i was on board of the brig <name> <name> we ran into a spout off the coast of brazil , and it knocked off the bow and the forward rail and nearly sank us . "
" i met one once , off the coast of cuba , " said the captain .
" that went ashore and tore up the trees like so many weeds for a hundred feet around .
a <unk> is nothing to be fooled with , i can tell you . "
on the day following the appearance of the <unk> the weather changed .
there was a slight storm and then a stiff breeze sprang up which was cheering to all on board .
every stitch of canvas on the columbia was spread and the schooner bowled along right merrily .
" i 'd like to know how this war is going on , and how <name> and <name> are faring , " said <name> to captain ponsberry .
" a whole lot may have happened since we left manila . "
" well , you 'll probably get word from your brother when you reach nagasaki , lad ; and we 'll get word from captain pennington , too . "
" i <name> neither of them has been wounded . "
" so do i ; but when one goes to the front he has got to put up with the fortunes of war .
being a soldier of fortune , as it is called , is no baby business . "
" do you suppose the japs are continuing to bombard port <name> ? "
" more than likely  if the place has n't fallen into their hands .
they want to make sure of their footing in lower <unk> , and they can never do that so long as the russians hold a single seaport down there . "
" i suppose russia has a pretty good-sized navy as well as an army ? "
" yes , <name> , one of the largest navies in the world .
but their fighting ships are no better than the ships of japan .
you see , the japanese navy is not near as old as the navy of russia .
almost all of the ships are of the up-to-date types .
most of them have been built since the war between japan and <name> in <unk> and 1895 . "
" that would make them only about ten years old . "
" exactly , and i 've been told that some of the ships in the russian navy are twenty and thirty years old .
more than this , all of the japanese guns are of the latest pattern  just as they are on our new warships . "
" i 'd like to go aboard of a japanese warship , " cried the young second mate , enthusiastically .
" want to see if it 's as good as it was aboard of the <name> , eh ? "
" yes , sir .
of course the <name> was old , especially alongside of the brooklyn , on which my brother <name> served in cuban waters , but even so she was a <unk> fighting machine .
if she had n't been she wouldn't have done her share in sinking that spanish fleet in manila bay . "
" well , you may have a chance to go aboard of a japanese ship while we stop at nagasaki .
there must be a number of them at that port , <unk> up and taking war supplies aboard . "
" how long do you think it <name> be before we reach that port ? "
" that <name> depend entirely upon the wind , as you know .
if we get just what we need we may reach there inside of four or five days , " answered captain ponsberry .
as peterson and shamhaven were now behaving themselves they were allowed to come out of the brig and do some work on the deck every morning and afternoon .
both begged the captain to forgive them , but the master of the columbia would promise nothing .
" you went into this with your eyes wide open , " he said .
" now you can line up and take your medicine . "
semmel was exceedingly bitter at not being allowed his <name> for at least a few hours a day and said he would denounce the captain at the first opportunity .
but captain ponsberry soon cut him short .
" you keep a civil tongue in your head , " he said , sternly .
" unless you do , i 'll put you down on <unk> and water . "
and thereupon semmel became sullenly silent .
towards evening of the day upon which <name> had the conversation about warships with captain ponsberry a chinese junk , heavily laden with <unk> boxes , was passed .
nobody on board could speak english , so the hail that was sent over the water brought no results .
" we are getting closer to the coast shipping , " said the master of the columbia .
" i suppose we 'll meet quite a few vessels from now on . "
during the night an unexpected <name> came up and the schooner was blown far out of her course .
the <name> came from the westward , so the vessel was blown to the east .
" this <name> make the trip a day or two longer , " grumbled grandon , after the <name> had spent itself .
" yes , but as we did n't lose a spar or a rag of canvas we can be thankful that it is no worse , " responded <name> , who was always ready to look on the bright side .
the <name> subsided after a blow of twenty-four hours and then the bow of the columbia was once more set towards her destination .
only a few knots had been covered when the lookout reported a vessel in sight .
" it 's a steamer ! "
cried <name> , for the smoke from the craft 's funnels was plainly to be seen .
" maybe she 's a warship , " returned <name> grandon , who was beside him .
" if so , i <name> she 's a japanese . "
the steamer was coming along at a good rate of speed and soon they made her out to be a british vessel .
she was a " tramp , " that is , a vessel going from port to port , picking up whatever cargo can be found .
" ahoy , there ! "
cried captain ponsberry , as the tramp slowed up .
" what ship is that ? "
" the lord <unk> , " was the answer .
" what ship is that ? "
" the columbia . "
" where are you bound ? "
" for nagasaki .
and you ? "
" for hong-kong . "
a little more talk followed , and the captain of the lord <unk> vouchsafed the information that he had sighted a russian warship the day before .
" a warship ! "
murmured <name> .
" which way was she bound ? "
asked captain ponsberry , anxiously .
" i ca n't tell you .
she stopped us and asked a few questions and then slipped away in the darkness . "
" what warship was she ? "
" the pocastra , from <unk> .
i think she used to be in the merchant service and was built over for the navy . "
the captain of the british steamer could give no further information , and so resumed his course , and the master of the columbia did likewise .
" ai n't very nice news , is it ? "
said <name> grandon .
" it 's very unpleasant news , " returned captain ponsberry , with a shrug of his shoulders .
" what are you going to do about it ? "
" what can we do , <name> ?
trust to luck that we get into nagasaki harbor , or some other port , in safety . "
" we 'll have to keep a sharp lookout for anything that looks like a warship , unless , of course , she flies a japanese flag . "
word was passed around to those who could be trusted , and all day long one of the mates and a foremast hand were kept on the lookout , taking turns at looking through the best glass the schooner possessed .
" this is almost as exciting as being in a war , " said <name> , when he was on duty with <name> .
" do n't you know how we looked for the spanish ships ? "
" yes , lad ; but if we sight a russian warship it <name> be small fighting we 'll do , to my way of thinking . "
" oh , we wo n't be able to fight at all .
we 'll simply have to rely on our wits to keep us out of being <unk> up as a prize of war , " responded the young second mate .
chapter xi an order to <unk> when taking on his cargo at manila , captain ponsberry had considered the possibility of being captured by a russian warship , and had talked the matter over with the agents of the richmond importing company and with a japanese official who was doing business on the sly in the philippines .
the japanese government was willing to pay for the cargo , whether it was delivered or not  presuming it was " <unk> up " by the russians , but was not willing to pay for the ship if the vessel was taken as a prize of war .
" that is a risk you must take yourself , " said the japanese official .
" we are willing to pay a high price for the cargo  we can not do more . "
and so the risk  so far as the schooner went  was divided equally between the richmond importing company and captain ponsberry and the other owners of the columbia .
as nearly the captain 's whole wealth was tied up in his share of the schooner , he was naturally anxious to make a safe trip , and he often came on deck to aid the <unk> in watching for the possible appearance of an enemy .
" if you see the least thing that looks suspicious , tell me at once , " was his order , and it was strictly obeyed .
as a consequence they ran away from two steamers that afternoon and another steamer the next morning  all too far off to show exactly what they were .
" this is n't bringing us much nearer to port , " said <name> to cal <name> , who was using the glass at the time .
" i do n't believe we have made a dozen knots since yesterday . "
" well , the old man is a bit nervous , " responded the boatswain , in a low voice .
" and i do n't blame him .
it 's no small matter to lose your craft and be thrown into prison in the bargain . "
" would they dare to throw us into prison ? "
" to be sure ,  if they could prove that we were aiding the japs . "
" well , they 'll have hard work proving that . "
an hour went by and it began to grow <name> .
then came a call from the bow .
" sail in sight ! "
" what is it ? "
demanded the captain instantly .
" a big steamer o ' some sort . "
captain ponsberry ran forward and took the glass .
for fully two minutes he did not speak and then he <name> a long breath and put down the glass .
" i 'm afraid she 's a warship , " he exclaimed , and his voice sounded unnatural .
" a warship ! "
echoed <name> .
" <name> you let me look ? "
he did so , and it was not long before he could make out the approaching craft quite clearly .
" well ? "
demanded grandon , who knew that <name> 's eyes were unusually strong .
" i reckon the captain is right . "
" a warship ? "
" yes , not a very large affair , but still a warship .
i should n't be surprised if she was the converted vessel the lord <unk> sighted . "
" just what i think , " put in captain ponsberry .
" we 've got to do our best to show her a clean pair of heels . "
" the mist may help us to run away , " suggested grandon .
" let us <name> so . "
necessary orders were given , and soon the columbia swung around on another tack , so that she had the large vessel on her starboard quarter .
but this movement was evidently noted by the stranger , and the latter headed directly for the schooner once more .
" she is after us , that is positive , " said captain ponsberry .
" there is a bank of mist over to the northward , " returned <name> .
" why not run into that ? "
" well spoken , lad ; we 'll do it , and as soon as the mist hides us we can go over on the other tack and throw her off the scent . "
the mist the young second mate had mentioned was nearly a quarter of a mile away and it was a question whether they could reach it before the stranger came up .
but fortune favored those on the schooner .
the mist rolled toward them , and in less than two minutes they were hidden as completely as could be desired .
" now to get entirely out of the way , " exclaimed captain ponsberry , and lost not a moment in having the sails shifted and a new course set .
through the mist they heard the other vessel steaming around <unk> and did their best to keep as far away as possible from the sound .
all during that evening and the night to follow the columbia kept to her new course .
this was taking her away from nagasaki , but this could not be helped .
the captain said if it became absolutely necessary he would run into some other japanese port .
when daybreak came the mist was as thick as ever .
but there were signs that it would not last much longer , and by nine o'clock the sun was struggling to come through the clouds .
nearly everybody was on deck , for they realized that a fatal moment might be at hand .
" there she is ! "
the cry came from half a dozen throats simultaneously .
there , on the port bow , loomed up the stranger , not an eighth of a mile away .
that she was a warship there was no longer any doubt , for her forward guns were plainly to be seen .
" we 're caught now ! "
muttered <name> grandon .
" not yet ! "
cried the captain , and gave orders to throw the columbia over on a new course .
but scarcely had this movement been made when there was a puff of smoke from the warship , a report , and a shot flew in front of the schooner 's bow .
" there 's our order to <unk> ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" whoever she is , she means business . "
as the columbia did not stop , another shot was fired , this time just grazing the bow .
seeing there was no help for it , captain ponsberry gave the necessary orders , and down came one sail after another .
as this was done the warship swung around and then those on the schooner saw that she flew the flag of russia .
" a russian warship ! "
ejaculated half a dozen .
" this looks to me as if the jig was up , " murmured <name> grandon .
as quickly as it could be done , captain ponsberry assembled his men on deck .
" men , " he said , briefly , " the officers on board of that warship wish to find out what they can about us .
if you are asked questions say nothing more than that you shipped for the voyage to nagasaki and san <name> , and that you know nothing about the cargo .
do you understand ? "
" aye , aye , sir , " came from those who were listening .
" i must depend upon you to help save the ship .
if the columbia is suspected of being in the employ of the japanese government , or of carrying a cargo for that nation , she <name> be taken as a prize of war and we 'll go to a russian prison most likely . "
" i do n't want to go to no russian prison ! "
cried out <name> , his face turning pale .
" i ai n't done nothing wrong ! "
" then keep your tongue from wagging too much , <name> , " answered the master of the schooner , grimly .
" there ai n't no use o ' fighting , is there ? "
asked <unk> .
" fighting ? "
came from <name> grandon .
" what could the old columbia do against a man-o'-war ?
why , they 'd blow us sky high in no time ! "
" no , there is absolutely no use of attempting to fight , " answered captain ponsberry .
" our only <name> lays in convincing them that they have no right to stop us . "
the hands were dismissed and sent forward , and captain ponsberry hurried below , to burn certain papers and secrete others .
this was in accordance with the orders received from the agents of the richmond importing company at manila .
in the meantime the russian warship had come to a stop in <unk> and now a small boat was lowered , containing a small crew , a <unk> , and a russian naval officer .
at the same time a signal was hoisted which meant that the officer was coming on board of the schooner .
" unless i miss my guess , this looks rather black for us , " said <name> , to <name> grandon .
" i agree with you , <name> , " responded the first mate .
" but we 've got to take our medicine , no matter how bitter it is . "
" if only that mist had held on to-day !
we might have slipped by that warship nicely . "
" i only <name> the old man fixes up his papers so that he can show a clean <name> of health , " went on grandon .
" you see , if they ca n't actually prove something against us , they wo n't dare to touch us .
they know what old <name> means , and russia has no <name> just now to get into trouble with uncle <name> . "
" the worst of it is , our cargo may look too suspicious to them .
under ordinary circumstances they know that the columbia would n't be carrying such a line of goods in these waters . "
" that 's true , too . "
" besides that , they may have had an agent at nagasaki and at manila spying on us .
they may know just what is being done .
the <unk> followers are mighty slick , i can tell you . "
captain ponsberry now came on deck and gave quick orders that the sailors should be lined up , to receive the visitor in a <unk> manner .
" a little goose grease may help , " he drawled , with a knowing glance at grandon and <name> .
the foremast hands did not know much about lining up , but took the places assigned to them , on the forward deck .
over the side a rope ladder was thrown , and then captain ponsberry , <name> grandon , and <name> awaited the arrival of the russian naval officer with keen interest .
chapter xii taken as a prize of war slowly but surely the small boat came closer to the schooner .
she rode the long swells of the pacific with full <name> , and <name> could not help but admire the long , sturdy strokes of the jackies , as they bent to their task .
" i do n't know but that they can handle a small boat as well as our own jackies , " said <name> .
" why should n't they ?
russian naval training ought to be first-class , " answered <name> grandon .
" they have been at it longer than uncle <name> . "
" true , but that does n't always count .
spain had been at it longer than we had , too , but when it came to war we beat her in double-quick order . "
as the small boat came closer they saw that the jackies were mostly men of middle age .
but the <unk> was younger and so was the naval officer , who was gazing rather anxiously toward the schooner , as if wondering what the result of his mission would be .
" wonder if that chap can talk english ? "
queried the first mate .
" if he ca n't the old man <name> be up a tree , for none of us can talk russian . "
" i reckon peterson and semmel can talk it , " answered <name> .
" but we do n't want either of those rascals to open his mouth . "
at last the small boat came up alongside of the columbia .
it was no easy matter to catch the rope ladder without getting bumped , but it was successfully accomplished , and then the russian officer lost no time in coming on board .
he at once saluted , and captain ponsberry and his mates did the same , and the sailors in the background did likewise .
" what ship is this ? "
asked the russian naval officer , after a few necessary formalities were at an end .
" the american schooner columbia , " answered captain ponsberry .
" would you mind telling me for what port you are bound ? "
went on the naval officer , who could speak fairly good english .
" we are bound for san <name> , with a <unk> at nagasaki . "
" ah !
what sort of a cargo are you carrying to nagasaki ? "
" one belonging to the firm for which the columbia is in commission . "
" the name of the firm , please ? "
" the richmond importing company . "
" ah ! "
said the naval officer again , and looked slightly displeased .
as it happened he had a brother in the army at port <name> , and had heard of the doings of <name> pennington at that place , and of how the young american had accused certain russians of trying to cheat the company he represented .
" what warship do you come from ? "
demanded captain ponsberry , feeling that he had an equal right to ask questions .
" the auxiliary cruiser , pocastra , of the russian navy , " answered the naval officer , politely .
" and where are you bound ? "
went on captain ponsberry , bluntly .
" that , sir , is a question only our commander , captain <unk> , can answer . "
" it 's queer you are steaming around in japanese waters . "
" perhaps so . "
the russian naval officer smiled in a knowing way .
" captain ponsberry , i am sorry , but i think i shall have to inspect your papers . "
captain ponsberry <name> himself up , resolved to put on as bold a front as possible .
" this is an american ship , sir . "
" granted , but i have my orders , " returned the naval officer , coldly .
" if i refuse to let you inspect the papers ? "
the young russian officer shrugged his shoulders .
" we shall be under the painful necessity of compelling you to show them . "
" you threaten me  an american captain ! "
" there is no help for it  i am simply obeying orders .
we inspect all ships that we find in this vicinity . "
" do you know i can make you pay dearly for this outrage ? "
" you can not call it an outrage .
you are in japanese waters , japan and russia are at war .
you knew that before you came into these waters .
am i to see the papers or not ? "
the commander of the columbia knew that the russian naval officer spoke the truth .
yet he made one more effort .
" very well ; i <name> show my papers , but i shall insist upon you signing a paper that your ship held us up . "
" you can send the paper to my ship for such a signature from my captain , " said the russian , <unk> .
by this time four of the jackies of the small boat had come on board .
all were armed and they lined up at the rail , close to the rope ladder .
they were good-natured sailors and grinned broadly at the hands on the columbia .
not one could speak a word of english , so conversation with them was impossible .
captain ponsberry led the way to the cabin of the columbia and the young russian officer followed .
getting out such papers as had been prepared for the occasion , the master of the schooner passed them over .
" these are correct so far as they go , " said the russian , after an examination lasting ten minutes had been made .
" but   " he paused .
" you have no further papers ? "
" those are my papers , sir , " answered captain ponsberry , briefly .
" then i <name> look at a specified list of your cargo . "
" i have n't such a list , " was the answer , which was true , as the list had been burnt up just a short while before .
at this statement the young russian frowned .
" every ship carries such a list . "
" still , i have n't any . "
" in that case , i shall have to order an inspection of the cargo . "
" sir , you are going too far ! "
said captain ponsberry , sternly , yet he knew he had no right to expect anything else .
" if i am going too far , i am able to take the consequences , " returned the russian , who was acting strictly under orders .
" very well , sir ; you can look the cargo over , " answered captain ponsberry .
" but i shall hold russia accountable for the outrage . "
the russian naval officer bowed and hastened up to the deck .
he spoke in his native tongue to one of the jackies who carried several small flags under his arm .
at once the <name> began to <unk> to the warship for further instructions .
" search the ship , " came back the order , and in a few minutes more another small boat left the side of the pocastra , containing an officer and a crew of eight .
" we are in for it now , that is certain , " observed <name> .
" they are not going to let us go until they are sure we are o. k. " the second boat was soon alongside of the schooner , and the officer in charge and four men came up on the deck and joined the other russians already there .
an <name> conversation was held between the two officers .
" we 'll take a general look at the cargo , " said the one who had just arrived .
" it <name> not do to go too far  in case we find everything as it should be .
we want no trouble with the yankee government . "
captain ponsberry was asked to have the <unk> hatch opened , and this work was done by <name> striker and several others .
then two of the russian sailors were sent below , and one of the officers went along .
in the meantime , peterson , unknown to anybody on board , had slipped off to the brig .
here he found ostag semmel in solitary confinement .
" semmel , a russian warship is close at hand , " he said , hurriedly .
" an officer and some men have just boarded us . "
" release me , peterson ! "
returned the russian sailor .
" release me and i <name> show captain ponsberry what i can do ! "
" you <name> not get me into trouble ? "
questioned peterson , anxiously .
" no .
quick  i am sure we can make money out of this . "
with an iron bar , peterson pried off the lock which had been put on the door of the brig , and <name> back the bolt .
then semmel came out of his prison , with his hands linked together .
as he was making his way to the stern deck <name> caught sight of him .
" stop ! "
he called out , in alarm , realizing what semmel might do .
" stop , semmel ! "
and he ran to capture the rascal .
" get out da <unk> ! "
roared the russian and aimed a blow at <name> 's head .
but the young second mate dodged and then caught the russian by the legs , hurling him flat on his breast .
but now peterson came behind and gave <name> a vicious kick in the side , which made the youth let go his hold .
" what 's the row there ? "
called out captain ponsberry , and looked much disturbed to see the escaped prisoner .
" put him back where he came from ! "
" help ! "
yelled semmel , in russian .
" help , in the name of the czar !
i am a russian subject !
this ship is in the employ of the japanese government ! "
" he speaks the truth ! "
called out peterson , also in russian .
" help us and protect us and we <name> prove it ! "
and he ran forward to where the russian officer on deck was standing .
" you are russians ? "
asked the officer , quickly .
" we are . "
" then i shall certainly assist you . "
he raised his voice .
" let that man go ! "
and he pointed at semmel , now surrounded by <name> , <name> , and cal <name> .
the latter words were uttered in english , so all of our friends understood them .
the two sailors looked inquiringly at the young second mate .
" he is nothing but a mutineer , " said <name> .
" we locked him up for it .
he ought to have been strung up on the <unk> , " he added , bitterly .
by this time captain ponsberry was on the scene , and those who had gone below were summoned on deck once more .
the captain glared at semmel , who lost no time in shrinking behind the russian officers for protection .
" i can prove the cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government , " said ostag semmel .
" my friend can prove it , too , " he added , pointing to peterson .
" it is true we tried to seize the ship  to take her to <unk> , or some other russian port , as a prize . "
" this is assuredly interesting , " said the leading russian officer .
" tell me your tale in full . "
despite captain ponsberry 's protests semmel told his story in his own way , and peterson corroborated it in every detail .
then shamhaven , thinking to curry favor , came forward .
" they tell the strict truth , " he said .
" i worked with them .
we did what we could for the benefit of the russian government .
every bit of cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government and was to be taken ashore at nagasaki .
the last cargo of the columbia was also sold at nagasaki to the japanese government . "
" when was this ? "
" about two months ago . "
more questions were put to semmel , peterson , and shamhaven , and at last the russian naval officer turned grimly to captain ponsberry .
" i have heard their story , and it <name> be unnecessary to make an inspection of your cargo , since they have told me of what it consists .
in the name of russia i claim this ship as a prize of war , and you and your crew must consider yourselves prisoners . "
chapter xiii prisoners on the " pocastra " captain ponsberry had feared the result ever since the unexpected appearance of ostag semmel , so he was not very much surprised when the russian naval officer stated that he should consider the columbia as a war prize and place those on board under arrest as prisoners of war .
" this is a high-handed proceeding , " said he , as calmly as possible , although his mind was in a whirl .
" i do not think so , " answered the russian officer .
" do you submit or not ? "
" since it would be useless to fight , we shall have to submit , " answered the master of the schooner .
" but , remember , i shall hold you and the russian government responsible for all you do . "
" as you have said that before , there is no use of repeating it , captain ponsberry .
we <name> take command of the vessel at once . "
" what are we going to do ? "
whispered <name> to <name> grandon .
" i do n't know  follow the old man , i reckon , " answered the first mate .
" we shall place a prize crew on this ship , " went on the russian officer .
" these men "  pointing to semmel , peterson , and shamhaven  " can remain on board .
the remainder of the crew and the officers , <name> be transferred to the pocastra .
i <name> give you a quarter of an hour in which to attend to your luggage .
please take no more along than is necessary . "
" this is certainly high-handed ! "
cried <name> .
" so we 've got to go over to that old coal box , eh ? "
grumbled <name> , when he heard the news .
" it 's hard luck , <name> . "
" you 're right , <name> , but it ca n't be helped . "
" what <name> they do with us ? "
" i have n't the least idea . "
" <name> they take us to russia ? "
" i suppose so  or stow us away in one of those cold and dirty siberian prisons until we can get uncle <name> to make them release us . "
when it came time to depart from the columbia <name> was allowed to take only a bundle of clothing along , and grandon and the common sailors were treated no better .
the captain was allowed a trunk and a suit case .
in the meantime semmel was questioned once more , and what he had to tell made the russians look darkly at our friends .
" he is pumping all sorts of falsehoods into them , i suppose , " said <name> to <name> , and he was right .
semmel made it appear that captain ponsberry was really an agent of the japanese government and that he ( semmel ) had done his best to gain possession of the ship wholly for the benefit of his own country .
" if you really did this , it is very worthy of you , " said one of the officers .
" but we shall have to investigate before we accept your story in full . "
this was not so encouraging , but with it ostag semmel had to be content .
fearing that a japanese warship might put in an appearance at any moment , the russians lost no time in transferring the officers and men of the columbia to the pocastra and at the same time a prize crew of two officers and ten men were taken from the warship to the schooner .
then the sails of the columbia were hoisted and off she set to the eastward , and the warship moved in the same direction .
when placed aboard the pocastra captain ponsberry was treated politely and given a small room of his own .
but the mates and the ordinary seamen were not so fortunate .
grandon , <name> , and <name> striker were hustled off to a prison pen on one deck of the auxiliary cruiser , and the others to another pen below , which was even worse .
" this is certainly hard luck , " said <name> , as he threw his bundle into a corner and sat down on an iron bench , while grandon and <name> did the same .
" and after we had almost reached nagasaki , too ! "
" well , there ai n't no use to cry over spilt milk , " came from <name> .
" we 're prisoners o ' war , an ' i reckon as how we have got to make the best o ' it .
ai n't the first time we 've been in sech a fix . "
" that is true , <name> , but it does n't help the matter any .
i guess we have seen the last of the old columbia . "
" i was afraid of this sort of thing happening ever since we left manila , " came from grandon .
" i told the old man to be careful , that   " " hush ! "
whispered <name> .
" they may be listening  to make sure that they have caught the right parties . "
" true for you , <name> ; i wo n't say another word about that .
but it looks dismal , no two ways o n't , " and the first mate <name> a mountainous sigh .
the prison pen into which they had been placed was an iron structure , reaching from floor to ceiling , and was not over ten feet square .
it had a solid back and the remaining three sides were built up of stout iron bars , only a couple of inches apart .
there was a door which was doubly locked , the key being held by a petty officer who could speak broken english and who rejoiced in the simple name of <unk> .
for short <name> <unk> him <unk> and this name stuck to him .
" does n't look as if a fellow could break out of here very easily , " said <name> , after an inspection of their prison .
" this is a regular bank vault . "
" would n't do you any good to break out , " returned grandon .
" as we are on the ocean , where would you go to ? "
" we might hide until the vessel made a landing . "
" humph , and that would be in some russian port , so you 'd be just as bad off . "
" well , i 'm not trying to escape just now .
i want to get the lay of the land first , and try to find out what they are going to do with us . "
from <unk> they learned that the pocastra was one of a large number of steamers of various russian lines which had been lately pressed into the service of the national navy .
she had been rushed through at one of the russian navy yards and provided with a battery of four small and four large guns , none , however , over eight inches .
she carried a crew of one hundred and eighty men , drafted principally from other warships .
she had an advertised speed of twenty knots an hour but rarely made over seventeen or eighteen .
she was old and her engines were constantly in need of repair , much to the disgust of captain <unk> , her commander .
" well , <unk> , how goes this war ? "
asked <name> , pleasantly , as the petty officer came around to give them something to eat .
" big fight all der dime , " answered <unk> .
" russians kill all der japs  sink all der jap ships , yes ! "
" you 're winning right along , eh ? "
" yes , russians win  japs no do noddings , no ! "
and the petty officer left the food on the bench and hurried away again .
" do you believe that ? "
asked <name> .
" no , i do n't , " came from grandon .
" he told us that simply to scare us , or else he does n't know the real truth . "
" exactly what i think . "
" these russians are a lot of <unk> , " growled <name> .
" just look at semmel .
he was forever tooting his horn , and yet he could n't do much of anything . "
" he got us into trouble , " said <name> , quickly .
" that 's true , but he had to have this warship with all on board to help him . "
the food which had been brought to them consisted of a big bowl of stew , with three spoons , and three chunks of black bread .
" they are going to treat us to the best , " said grandon , sarcastically .
he lifted one of the spoons and tasted the stew .
" phew , it 's hot enough !
pepper , garlic , and hot water ! "
" does beat all how these <unk> do love their garlic , " grumbled <name> .
" 't was the same way with them spaniards in the philippines . "
" garlic and grease , " added <name> .
" and this bread is hard enough to build a wall with , " he continued .
" however , we have got to eat or go hungry . "
and he partook of just enough to stay his stomach .
<name> and grandon were not so particular and despite their grumbling managed to make away with all that remained .
they saw nothing of the captain , or of the sailors who had been taken below , and the time <name> heavily on their hands .
at night they were given three <unk> and these they slung from one side of the prison to the other and rested as well as could be expected .
the russian sailors often came to the pen to gaze at them , but they had been warned not to attempt to converse with the prisoners , so nothing was said .
on the afternoon of the third day aboard of the pocastra , those in the pen heard a loud shouting on deck , followed by a rush of feet .
<name> , who was resting in the corner for the want of something better to do , leaped up .
" something is doing ! "
he cried to his companions .
" here comes captain ponsberry , " ejaculated <name> grandon .
he was right , the captain was coming up in company with <unk> and two sailors .
the russian petty officer opened the door of the pen and captain ponsberry was thrust inside .
then the door was locked as before .
" how are you , boys ? "
cried the captain , cordially .
" all well , i <name> . "
" we are , " answered grandon .
" and you ? "
" i 'm well enough , but still angry to think that we lost the columbia . "
" so are we angry , " said <name> .
" but we 've got to stand it .
what 's that noise ? "
" they have sighted a chinese junk , and i reckon they are going to treat her as they did our vessel , " answered the captain .
the noise on deck continued , followed by quarter of an hour of silence .
then came a shot , followed by a second and a third .
" another order to <unk> , " said <name> .
" wonder if the chinamen <name> give in as we did ? "
" they <name> if they are wise , " said grandon .
but the chinamen did not believe in surrendering thus easily .
they were carrying rice for the japanese army , and thought that this was known to the enemy .
consequently they did their best to sail away .
hardly had the craft started on a new course when the pocastra opened a direct fire upon her .
the noise below decks was deafening and fairly shook the iron pen in which our friends were confined .
" hullo , that sounds like real war ! "
cried <name> .
" they mean business now . "
one broadside was followed by another , and the chinese junk was raked from end to end with such a deadly fire that more than a sixth of the sailors and officers were killed .
then the captain flung a white flag to the breeze in token of surrender .
" we have won ! "
cried those on the pocastra , and it was not long before our friends understood .
small boats were put out , and presently half a dozen chinese officers from the junk were brought on board as prisoners .
a fire that had started on the prize ship was put out after some hard work ; and then a temporary crew was put on board , and the junk followed in the wake of the old columbia , with the warship keeping guard over both .
chapter xiv progress of the war an hour after the capture of the chinese junk one of the officers of the ill-fated craft was thrust into the prison pen with our friends .
he was a small <unk> celestial rejoicing in the name of won lung , and it was soon learned that he could speak a little english , he having once paid a visit to san <name> .
" all go up spout ! "
said he , referring to his own ship .
" t'ink we safe when russian gunboat come , den all up spout ! "
" did they sink your ship ? "
asked captain ponsberry .
" no sink  shoot holes , back , front , side  all up spout .
no <unk> no more den  all up spout ! "
the latter was his pet phrase and he used it over and over again .
" you were in the japanese trade ? "
" yes  <name> rice .
now russians got rice , got junk  all won lung 's money gone up spout ! "
and the celestial made an odd little <unk> .
" well , they took my ship , too . "
" big schooner your <unk> ? "
" yes . "
" won lung weep for you  all ship gone up spout , <unk> like won <unk> ship gone up spout ! "
" well , we have n't gone up the spout yet , " put in <name> , with a laugh .
" let us thank fortune that we are alive and well . "
" dat so  won lung lose <unk> on junk  six , seven , ten  do n't know how many yet , " and the chinese officer shook his head sadly .
" bad war , bad ! "
" can you tell us how the war is going ? "
asked <name> grandon .
" these russians say everything is a russian victory . "
" russians <unk> dat ? "
" yes  they pretend to say they have the japs about beaten . "
at this won lung screwed up his eyes into mere slits .
" big lie dat .
japanese win <unk> <unk> <unk> .
russian warships gone up spout  russian army run like  like  up spout ! "
after that won lung told them all he knew .
it was hard to understand him , yet they gathered that there had been another sea fight in the vicinity of port <name> , in which the russian navy had come off second best , and that the japanese army that had landed in <unk> had driven the enemy to the <unk> , over the <unk> river , and was now forcing them back upon <unk> .
" if this news about the army is true , <name> and <name> must be having a hot time of it , " was <name> 's comment .
" i must say , i am mighty glad they are on the winning side . "
" did n't i tell ye them russians are a lot o ' <unk> ? "
came from <name> .
" the truth ai n't in 'em half the time . "
" perhaps they do not get the correct news from the front , " came from captain ponsberry .
" the <unk> may keep the bad news back , for fear of disheartening the rest of the men in the army and navy . "
" they tell me the russians are very strict about sending out news , " rejoined <name> .
" it is true , <name> ; no country on the globe is <unk> .
no telegram can be sent without it is inspected , and the newspapers can not print a single scrap of news , or a single editorial , until after the press censor has passed upon it . "
" if that 's the case , i do n't wonder that some of the people want to be free . "
" russia is more free to-day than she ever was before , and freedom is bound to come sooner or later  that is , i mean , not such freedom as we have in the united states , but such freedom as they have in england and germany  where , at least , a man can call his soul his own . "
" it 's a wonder the russians <name> fight for their country , if they are so ground down . "
" they know nothing better , and besides , they are really patriotic .
if the czar would only treat them a little better , and give them a little more <name> , they would be the most faithful of subjects .
but when a man ca n't do at all as he wants to do , and ca n't open his mouth about it either , he is apt to grow sullen and ugly . "
as day after day went by life on the russian warship became almost unendurable for <name> and the others .
they suffered greatly for the want of fresh air , and at last made a vigorous protest to the captain of the ship , when he happened to be passing the pen .
as a result orders were given that they should be allowed three hours on deck each day , one in the morning and two after dinner .
" this is a little like , " said <name> , when coming on deck for the first time .
" oh , how good it feels to breathe fresh air once more ! "
and he filled his lungs to their fullest capacity .
for their daily exercise <name> and <name> were chained together , and the pair inspected with great curiosity as much of the warship as was allowed .
" it 's not so very different from some of our own auxiliary cruisers , " said <name> .
" but , after all , i like ours better . "
" that 's right , lad ; stick up fer your own country every trip . "
" well , what do you say , <name> ? "
" i say i 'd rather be on one of uncle <name> 's ships than on any other in the world . "
while allowed to roam around on deck , <name> often looked eagerly for the columbia , but the schooner and the chinese junk were too far off to be distinguished with the naked eye .
" we 'd give a good deal to be back on her deck , would n't we , <name> ? "
said he .
" do n't mention it , lad ; it makes me sick , " grumbled the yankee tar .
" i wish i knew just what was being done on land , do n't you ?
perhaps this war <name> end soon , and then we 'll be set free . "
" it wo n't end yet awhile , <name> , <name> my words on that , " answered <name> .
the old yankee sailor was right  the war was far from ended , and here it may be well to note briefly what was taking place on the sea between russia and japan , while the army of the mikado was pushing through <unk> in the direction of <unk> .
the loss of the great battleship <unk> has already been recorded in " under the mikado 's flag . "
this vessel was sunk by a mine in port <name> harbor , <name> 13 , 1904 , and carried down with her admiral <unk> and about five hundred officers and men .
at the same time the battleship <unk> was also injured by a mine .
the loss of the admiral 's <unk> was a great blow to russia , and while she was trying to recover , port <name> was vigorously shelled by the japanese fleet , and many buildings were more or less damaged .
some warehouses were set on fire , but the local fire department , aided by the russian garrison , succeeded in putting out the conflagration .
while the japanese fleet was hammering at the city and the ships from beyond the harbor , the japanese army encircled port <name> on land , taking possession of every available hill beyond the russian line of defenses .
as a consequence , by the middle of may the city was in a complete state of siege , nearly all communication with the outside world being cut off .
but now came a turn in affairs which , for a short while , made matters look favorable for russia .
while the fleet of admiral togo was <unk> the whole of the southeastern coast of <unk> and protecting the japanese transports which were pouring troops into the country , occurred a catastrophe as appalling as it was unexpected .
on the same day , may 15 , the magnificent battleship <unk> , of the japanese navy , was blown up by mines and sunk , and the protected cruiser , <unk> , also of admiral togo 's fleet , <unk> in the fog with a sister ship , and was a total loss .
it is estimated that by these two disasters seven hundred men were lost .
among the officers who met their fate were men of marked ability which japan at this crisis could ill afford to lose .
the loss of the <unk> is worth relating in detail .
she had been along the coast during a heavy fog , but this had cleared off and the sun was shining brightly .
not an enemy was in sight , and all was quiet on the great battleship when , without warning , a terrific explosion was felt near the stern and a portion of the steering gear was damaged .
" we have struck a mine ! "
cried some one on board , and without delay signals were hoisted for the other vessels in sight to stand by .
the battleship was drifting and the locality was full of mines .
it was a moment of terrible suspense .
then came another explosion , greater than the first , which ripped large holes through her heavy plates .
at once the battleship began to fill , and presently she sank like a stone to the bottom of the sea .
the other warships put out their small boats with all speed , and succeeded in rescuing about three hundred officers and men out of a total of nearly eight hundred .
among those lost were <unk> <unk> and captain <unk> , the commander of the warship .
the <unk> was lost while steaming slowly southward , after a <unk> vigil near the entrance to port <name> harbor .
other vessels of the <unk> fleet were close by , so each ship had to advance with extreme caution .
but the fog , instead of lifting , became thicker , and at a little before two o'clock in the afternoon the cruiser was rammed by the <unk> , another vessel of the fleet .
a large hole was torn in the hull of the <unk> .
" out with the collision mats ! "
cried the commander of the cruiser , and the mats were brought out without delay and placed over the side .
but the hole was too great to be stopped in that manner .
then the captain called the entire crew on deck , and ordered the small boats to be lowered , five on the starboard side and one on the port .
before the boats could be gotten away , the <unk> listed heavily to starboard and went down , smashing the five small boats under her .
the other boat managed to get away , with only a handful of jackies and a couple of officers .
the captain remained on the bridge and went down with his ship .
as soon as possible the <unk> put out her boats and succeeded in rescuing about ninety men , out of a total of over two hundred and fifty .
it was a great blow to japan and the russians were correspondingly elated .
feeling that admiral togo 's grip on the sea was now weakened , the russian squadron at <unk> sailed forth and did much damage to the shipping on the northern coast of japan , sinking several merchantmen and taking a number of others as prizes .
the russian squadron also met the japanese transport <unk> <unk> , having on board the <unk> regiment of japanese infantry .
" surrender , or we <name> sink you ! "
<unk> the russian commander .
the japanese refused , and were given exactly an hour in which to think it over .
as they still refused , a torpedo was discharged against the doomed ship .
as she began to sink the japanese soldiers opened fire with their rifles , and then the russians answered with their machine guns , mowing down the mikado 's men by the score .
but the japanese were brave to the last , and sank beneath the waves with the cry of <unk> !
( hurrah ! )
on their lips .
it was an auxiliary cruiser of the <unk> squadron which had taken the columbia and the chinese junk as prizes of war .
the captain of the cruiser was now looking for the rest of the squadron , but so far none of the warships had been sighted .
" they must have returned to <unk> , " he reasoned , and then turned in that direction with the pocastra , never dreaming of what the near future held in store for himself , his ship , and his crew .
chapter xv a sharp naval battle so far the weather had been good , but following the conversation recorded in the last chapter there came up a dense fog , and for twenty-four hours the russian warship did nothing but creep along in the gloom .
during that time , for some unknown reason , <name> and the others were allowed greater freedom than before .
each had his hands chained behind him , but all were separate , which allowed each to roam around as he pleased .
" this is better than being linked to somebody else , " said the youth to his old sailor friend .
" not but that we got along well enough together , " he added , hastily .
" you 're right  there was n't no sense in <unk> ' us together , " answered <name> .
" we ca n't git away if we want to . "
" we might , if we did n't have our hands chained , <name> . "
" how ? "
" if we all got together some night  providing we could keep out of the pen  and stole one of the small boats . "
" easier said nor done .
the guard would ketch ye an ' shoot ye down like a dog . "
" oh , i know there would be a great risk .
but i hate to think of going to a siberian prison , or aboard a russian prison ship . "
" so do i , <name> .
but even if we stole the boat and got away , where would we go to ,  especially if we did n't have much provisions an ' water ? "
<name> could not answer that question , since he did not know the location of the pocastra .
it might be that they were hundreds of miles from land .
if so , to take to a small boat with a scarcity of water and provisions would certainly be foolhardy .
the fog continued during the night , but swept away as if by magic about nine o'clock in the morning .
at that time the prisoners had had their breakfast and <name> and <name> were between decks , looking at some gunners ' assistants cleaning out one of the large guns .
suddenly came a call from the lookout , followed by half a dozen commands .
as everything said was in russian , our friends did not understand a word , but they soon realized that something unusual was in the air .
a shrill whistle sounded out and drums began to beat to quarters .
" i 'll wager a new hat they have sighted a japanese ship ! "
cried <name> , and scarcely had he spoken when there came a dull booming over the water .
" let us go to the deck an ' see what 's doing , " returned <name> , and both started for the stairs .
but scarcely had they appeared on the deck when they were ordered below again .
<name> was right ; a japanese warship had been sighted , and this vessel had lost no time in discharging a signal gun to a sister ship only a few miles away .
hardly had the youth and his friend reached the lower deck once more than the japanese cruiser opened fire on the russian vessel .
the latter <unk> , and the booming of cannon shook the pocastra from stem to stern .
" this is a fight for fair ! "
ejaculated <name> , with a broad smile on his face .
" i <name> the japs win , <name> ! "
" so do i , lad .
but where do we come in , that 's what i want to know ? "
" if we could only drop overboard and swim to that other ship ! "
" no use of trying  some of the fellows in the tops would pick us off in no time .
no , we 've got to stay right where we are an ' take what comes . "
" where are the others ? "
they looked around , but could see nothing of captain ponsberry or <name> grandon .
they saw cal <name> run past , but he was out of sight before they could stop him .
suddenly a crash above them told that a solid shot had struck the upper works of the russian cruiser .
then came another crash at the bow .
" those japs know how to fire , " came from the yankee sailor .
" reckon as how they 're going to do their best to blow this ship <unk> .
i 'd give 'most a dollar to be somewhere else just about now ! "
and he shook his head anxiously .
the russian gunners were working with a <name> , and so were their numerous assistants .
the pocastra was swung around , and now both ships were broadside to each other .
the thunder of the guns was terrific and the smoke rolled around in all directions .
" puts me in mind o ' the battle o ' manila bay , eh ? "
remarked <name> , as he and <name> stood at a distance , watching the russians work one of the guns .
" you are right , <name> , only   " <name> got no further , for at that moment came another crash on deck .
the pocastra shivered and heaved , and to those below it was as if she would surely sink .
" they 're pumping it into us , sure as you 're born ! "
sang out the old yankee tar .
" hullo , what 's this ? "
there was a rush of several gunners across the deck .
" beware of that gun ! "
yelled one in russian , and then a stampede followed .
in the midst of the confusion came a fearful explosion from below .
a portion of the flooring was ripped apart and one of the gunners was instantly killed and several wounded .
a great volume of smoke rolled up , and splinters and bits of iron and steel flew in all directions .
both <name> and <name> were almost stunned by the explosion and for the moment could do nothing but clutch each other in terror .
both were struck by the flying splinters , but neither was seriously wounded .
they staggered back and began to cough , for the dense smoke was <unk> .
" must have been a torpedo   " gasped <name> .
" or else a magazine ! "
spluttered <name> .
" let  let us get  get out of here .
i 'm  choking  to  to  death ! "
it was really a magazine which had exploded .
this tore a good-sized hole in the <unk> side , in a spot impossible to get at in the confusion .
in the meantime a solid <unk> shell struck the russian ship squarely in the stern , doing additional damage and killing and wounding two officers and nine men .
almost choked to death , <name> and <name> crawled to where the ladder ran to the deck .
the russian jackies and gunners were swarming up , along with all the prisoners .
" <name> , are you safe ? "
came in the voice of captain ponsberry , and he loomed up , with <name> grandon , cal <name> , and the chinese petty officer beside him .
" so far i am , " answered <name> .
" but i  i  must have air ! "
and he began to cough .
the jam on the ladder was terrific , and in the midst of the <unk> a russian gunner and the chinese petty officer got into a quarrel .
the gunner threw the celestial down , but he bounced up like a ball , and in a twinkling the russian received a blow in the stomach which sent him staggering back into the crowd and the deadly smoke .
" no knock me up the spout ! "
sang out the celestial .
" ship go down i go <unk> ! "
and soon he was out on the upper deck .
fighting , surging , pushing , and yelling the russians and our friends got to the deck at last .
captain ponsberry had his coat literally ripped from his back , and cal <name> had an arm almost torn from its socket .
for this he gave a russian gunner a rap in the mouth which knocked loose several teeth .
it was a case of each man for himself , and many fought like wild beasts .
at last <name> found himself free of the crowd , with <name> still beside him .
captain ponsberry and cal <name> were not far away , but between surged a great number of russians .
the pocastra was <unk> heavily to port and had evidently taken a large quantity of water into her hull .
two japanese warships were now at hand and both were firing upon the doomed russian cruiser with deadly accuracy .
from the fighting tops of the mikado 's ships came a perfect hail of small bullets which sent the russians to the deck by the score .
by this fire one of the <unk> sailors was killed and cal <name> was seriously wounded .
a bullet likewise grazed <name> striker 's thigh , drawing some blood , but the yankee tar did not know of this until the conflict was at an end and he saw the crimson stain on his shoe top .
at last the russian captain saw that to fight further would be useless .
the pocastra was in danger of going down at any moment .
the guns could no longer be used , and he ordered the colors lowered and put up a signal of surrender .
a wild cheer came from the two japanese warships when it was realized that the battle was won .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " rent the air over and over again .
" hurrah for the mikado !
down with the russians ! "
a little while after the fighting came to an end , several small boats put off from the two japanese warships and half a dozen of the <unk> naval officers presented themselves at the <unk> side .
the russian ship still listed heavily , but after the smoke below had cleared away it was ascertained that the damage done was not as great as had been imagined .
one of the magazines which had been in danger of blowing up had been flooded , and the rush of sea water had likewise put out a fire that had started in the stern .
as soon as order could be restored on board of the pocastra a complete surrender was made to the japanese , the russian captain giving up his sword .
then a general conference was had lasting over an hour .
at the end of that time , much to their surprise , the americans were asked to go over to one of the japanese warships .
" we 'll go , and glad of the chance , " said captain ponsberry ; and soon the transfer was made .
chapter xvi aboard a japanese warship " what a beauty of a ship ! "
such was <name> 's exclamation as he stepped aboard of the japanese warship .
the vessel was , like the russian prize , an auxiliary cruiser and named the <unk> <unk> .
she was but three years old and had been used for passenger service between japan and <name> .
for such a small cruiser she carried an unusually heavy battery , and everything was shined up to the last degree ,  the work having been undertaken directly after the battle was over .
the <unk> <unk> had suffered but little damage during the contest and only a handful of men had been killed and wounded .
" this looks more like uncle <name> 's navy than anything i have seen yet , " said <name> .
" well , i do n't know that the decorations aboard our ships are quite so fine , " returned the youth .
" but then this is n't an ordinary fighting ship .
some of the auxiliary cruisers we used during the war with spain  those that used to be <unk> steamers  were just as fine as this and finer . "
as soon as those from the columbia reached the japanese warship the wounded were taken in charge by the surgeons and placed in the sick bay , as the hospital on a naval vessel is called .
this was also in the best of order , with nice , swinging cots , and appliances of the latest designs .
as there were many things to be arranged between the two japanese vessels and the russian prize , our friends were not interviewed until late in the evening .
in the meantime , some of the russians were made prisoners , and a prize crew was placed aboard of the pocastra .
then the two japanese warships moved away , with the captured cruiser between them .
" those russians must feel sick , " was <name> 's comment .
" it 's worse for them , in a way , than if their ship had gone down . "
" well , we all thought she was sinking , " returned captain ponsberry .
" if she had sunk i reckon some of us would n't be here to tell the tale . "
when evening came , a guard who could speak a little english conducted captain ponsberry , <name> , and <name> grandon to the commander 's cabin .
here they were met by captain <unk> , who , being a graduate of the japanese naval school , could speak not only english but also several other foreign languages .
it may be mentioned here that the japanese naval academy of to-day is one of the foremost institutions of its kind in the world .
" i <name> hear your story , captain ponsberry , " said the japanese captain , politely , as he motioned his visitors to be seated .
in a plain , direct manner the master of the columbia told his tale , starting from the time the schooner left manila with a cargo intended for the japanese government .
he told of the trouble with semmel and of the mutiny , and then of the capture by the pocastra .
" you have assuredly been unfortunate , " said captain <unk> .
" have you any idea where your schooner is now ? "
" i have not , but i thought she must be close to the russian ship  she and that chinese junk , too .
the pocastra was taking them to <unk> as prizes . "
" ah ! "
the japanese captain mused for a moment .
" i dare say you would like to gain back your ship ? "
he continued .
" indeed i would ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" i 'd give a pretty dollar to do so ! "
" i shall interview the captain of the russian warship again to-morrow .
it may be that he <name> tell us where she is  although i doubt it . "
after this a few questions were put to <name> and <name> grandon and both corroborated what captain ponsberry had said .
they were also questioned concerning the treatment they had received while on the pocastra .
" you may be thankful that the treatment was no worse , " said captain <unk> .
" of late some of the russians have treated their prisoners in a most brutal fashion . "
" we are thankful , " replied the master of the columbia .
the majority of the staterooms aboard of the <unk> <unk> were occupied by the officers of the cruiser , but one small room was turned over to captain ponsberry , and a larger apartment was turned over to <name> grandon and <name> .
at <name> 's <unk> <name> striker was allowed to " bunk in " with the first and second mates .
" this 'ere ship is jest about next to a palace , " was <name> 's comment .
" ai n't seen nothing so fancy in a long time . "
the japanese warships were bound for the nearest naval station with their prize .
they could readily have made eighteen knots an hour , but the crippled russian cruiser could not make over ten , and so this was the rate of speed set for all three .
the americans were allowed the freedom of the ship and <name> and <name> spent many hours in inspecting the guns and other <unk> , and in watching the japanese jackies in the gun and cutlass drills , their physical exercises , and in their drills to fight fire and to lower the small boats .
everything on board ran as smoothly as clockwork , much to their delight .
" i can tell you what , <name> ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically , " this beats the russians all hollow !
i never saw anything so well done ! "
" almost beats our own navy , does n't it ? "
" well , i do n't know about that .
but it is certainly just as good .
that drill to fight fire is immense , and their physical exercises ought to make each man 's muscles like iron . "
" they are a sturdy lot , lad , no two ways about that ,  and they understand just how to keep themselves in the pink of condition . "
<name> rubbed his <name> reflectively .
" do ye know what i have in mind to do ? "
" i think i can make a pretty good guess , " came quickly from <name> .
" well ? "
" you 're thinking that you 'd like to join the japanese navy , just to have a mix-up or two with the russians . "
" you 've struck the nail on the head , lad .
and why not , seeing as how we are out here in fighting waters , and with no ship of our own to go aboard ? "
" well , i feel a good bit that way myself .
<name> is in the army , and so is <name> pennington .
if they can make a record for themselves why should n't i do the same ?
as it was i came close to joining the army with <name> . "
" so you told me before .
but you 're a born sailor , <name> , not a soldier . "
" i do n't deny it .
i 'd rather be on board of a ship than on land any day . "
" yes , to a fellow as gets used to the sea the land seems a strange place . "
from the japanese on the warship who could speak english our friends learned much concerning the war .
they were told that admiral <unk> fleet was keeping a strict guard over the harbor approach to port <name> , and that a portion of the japanese army was <unk> in the city on the land side and had lately captured several hills of importance .
from captain <unk> the americans obtained permission to station themselves in one of the fighting tops , and here they spent hour after hour , on the lookout for the columbia .
captain ponsberry was particularly anxious to find his vessel , and kept scanning the japan sea through a fine spyglass the japanese captain loaned him .
" if i can gain possession of that ship , i am going to fix semmel and peterson , " said the master of the columbia .
" both of them declared that they took possession of the ship for the sake of the russian government , " said <name> .
" that being the case , they should be treated as prisoners of war . "
" exactly my idea , <name> . "
" semmel is a thoroughly bad egg , " came from <name> grandon .
" he <name> lie out of his troubles if he can possibly do so . "
" it <name> be a shame if we do n't find the columbia again , " went on <name> .
" think of those rascals taking her to <unk> and getting their share of the prize money !
it makes me sick ! "
" captain <unk> tells me that other japanese warships are in this vicinity , " said captain ponsberry .
" they may fall in with the schooner even if we do n't .
but what they <name> do with her , in that case , there is no telling .
they might claim her as a prize also , and if they did , i'd have some trouble in getting my property back . "
what the japanese captain had said was true .
in order to counteract the doings of the russian squadron which was <unk> the northern and eastern coasts of japan , the mikado had sent out a flying squadron of six or seven vessels , all of which , though not large , had good sailing powers .
owing to the heavy mists , the flying squadron became separated , and two of the vessels fell in with the pocastra , as already described .
of the other ships some proceeded up the coast to <unk> and caught two russian <unk> loaded with coal and another ship carrying steel rails for the <unk> railroad .
the remainder of the squadron put further to sea , and on the fourth day out caught sight of two russian steamers loaded with munitions of war .
a <name> ensued , lasting three days , and several shots were exchanged at long range .
but a mist , coming up one night , put an end to the <name> , and chagrined to think that the enemy had given them the slip after all , the japanese turned back once more , to look for the other vessels of the flying squadron .
chapter xvii the <unk> of the " columbia " " we are in for another storm ! "
it was <name> who made the remark .
he was in one of the tops with <name> , gazing anxiously to the westward , where the black clouds were beginning to pile up .
" right you are , lad  and it 's going to be a heavy one , unless i miss my guess . "
the storm broke half an hour later , and the wind and rain were so furious that our friends were glad to leave the top and go below .
but some of the japanese sailors did not appear to mind the lashing of the elements and remained on deck as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring .
" these chaps beat me ! "
said <name> .
" they are certainly as tough as pine knots .
i never saw their equal . "
" i 'm beginning to think that the japanese are a wonderful nation , " put in <name> grandon , seriously .
" i used to look at them as something like the chinese .
but there is a wide difference between them and the chinks . "
" a chinaman is n't in it alongside of a japanese , " came from captain ponsberry .
" the japanese are up-to-date and very progressive ; the chinese are about a hundred years behind the times . "
the storm continued for the best part of half a day .
there was but little thunder and lightning , but the wind blew a perfect <name> .
yet even the pocastra did not seem to mind the wind , and all three of the warships proceeded on their way at only a slightly reduced rate of speed .
" such a <name> as this <name> play havoc with the sailing vessels , " said <name> .
" i wonder how the old columbia is making out ? "
" i was thinking that same , " rejoined captain ponsberry .
" to tell the truth , i 'd rather have her go to the bottom than see her taken to a russian port as a prize . "
when the storm cleared away , <name> was one of the first to go on deck , to get a whiff of " washed air , " as he called it .
the others followed .
" i see a sail ! "
cried the youth , a moment later , and at that instant came a cry from the lookout .
far to the eastward was a sailing vessel flying a signal of distress .
" she looks familiar to me ! "
ejaculated captain ponsberry , and ran to get captain <unk> 's glass .
one glance through the instrument was enough .
" the columbia ! "
" are you sure ? "
cried <name> .
" she certainly is the columbia , " said <name> grandon , after a look through the glass .
" she has lost her fore topmast and part of her bowsprit . "
" and a part of the stern rail is gone , " added <name> , after he too had used the glass .
" let us tell captain <unk> , " he added , starting to go below .
the news that the columbia was in sight was soon circulated throughout the ship , and captain <unk> at once <unk> to the other warships that he was going to her assistance .
then the <unk> <unk> steamed away on her new course .
as they <name> closer to the schooner they could see that the storm had treated the gallant old ship roughly enough .
many of the sails were in ribbons , and not only the fore topmast but also half a dozen of the spars were gone .
one end of the forecastle was stove in , and a part of the stern was a wreck .
" this is the worst yet ! "
cried <name> .
" they must have caught more of the <name> than we did . "
" they did n't know how to handle her , that 's the reason of it , " came from captain ponsberry .
" we have taken her through a worse blow than that ; eh , <name> ? "
" i think so , " answered the second mate .
as soon as the japanese warship was close enough a boat was lowered and an officer went aboard of the schooner , followed by several of his crew and captain ponsberry , grandon , and <name> .
the russians having the schooner in charge were meek enough .
as a matter of fact the <name> had <unk> them , and all had imagined they were surely going to the bottom of the sea .
they did not like it to find themselves in the hands of the enemy and were astonished when they learned that the pocastra had been captured .
" it was a fearful storm , " said the russian officer who was in charge .
" several times i fancied the masts would all go by the board .
i shall never want another such experience .
one man was washed overboard and several were badly hurt by the wrecking of the forecastle . "
" were any of my former men injured ? "
asked captain ponsberry .
" it was my fellow countryman , ostag semmel , who was swept overboard and drowned , " answered the russian officer .
" semmel ! "
ejaculated <name> .
he <name> a long breath and his hatred of the man died all in an instant .
" poor chap !
that was rough on him ! "
" it certainly was rough , " answered captain ponsberry .
" and what of the others ? "
" both peterson and shamhaven were hurt , but not seriously .
they are below resting , " was the answer .
it was found that some of the seams of the schooner had opened but that no alarming quantity of water was running into the well .
the russians were asked to surrender as prisoners of war and this they did willingly , and were transferred to the japanese warship .
then captain ponsberry was asked if he wished to take charge of the columbia again .
" <name> a duck swim ! "
he cried .
" of course i want to take charge .
hasn't she always been my ship ?
and my crew <name> want to go with me , i know . "
" but the wreckage   " began captain <unk> .
" i 'll attend to that , sir ,  do n't you worry .
only give me back my ship , that 's all i ask . "
" it shall be as you say , captain ponsberry .
but when you get to nagasaki you <name> have to settle matters with the japanese government .
it is , all told , a rather peculiar case .
in one way , she is now a japanese prize of war , and in another way she is not . "
" i understand , and the courts <name> have to settle the tangle , sir .
i'll do what is fair , and i know the richmond importing company <name> do the same . "
" then you can go aboard of the ship as soon as you please . "
" thank you very much . "
captain ponsberry had returned to the warship for just this talk , and now he lost no time in getting back to the columbia , taking with him all his crew , including cal <name> , who was just about able to get around once more .
" hurrah ! "
cried <name> , " this seems like home once more , does n't it ? "
" that 's what it does , " answered <name> .
" but there is plenty of work ahead , i can tell you that , lad . "
" i do n't care  work <name> help to pass the time . "
when peterson and shamhaven saw captain ponsberry they did not know what to say .
the loss of their leader , semmel , had humbled them greatly .
" i 'm not going to say much to you , seeing as how both of you are hurt , " said the master of the columbia , briefly .
" but understand , i want no nonsense from either of you . "
" i 'll do all i can to assist you , captain , " said shamhaven , humbly .
" all i want is another chance . "
" which you 'll not get from me , " was the quick rejoinder .
" i know you thoroughly , shamhaven , and i am done with you .
you and peterson aided the russians and you can now consider yourselves under arrest .
when we get into port i 'm going to hand you over to the japanese authorities . "
both of the <unk> wanted to argue , but the captain would not listen .
their hurts were inspected and they were told that they would be allowed three days in which to <unk> , after which they would have to do their share of duty .
" i do n't like this , " growled shamhaven , after the interview was over .
" peterson , we are in it deeper than ever . "
" dat is so , " was the answer , with a scowl .
" vell , ve not put up mit him , hey ?
maybe , ven we git near shore , we run avay , shamhaven . "
" yes , if we can get the chance .
but i do n't know where you are going to run to  especially if you have n't any money . "
" ve git money . "
" from where ? "
" i to n't know <name> yet , no , but ve git him , yes .
captain ponsberry must haf some , and <name> <name> <name> , too .
<unk> i see <name> mit a money pelt vot haf some gold in him , yes . "
" a money belt with gold ?
you must be dreaming . "
" no , i see him mit mine two eyes .
he count der gold .
he haf more as dirty pieces . "
" that is worth remembering , " answered shamhaven .
and he began to speculate upon what he could do in japan if he was free and had a money belt full of gold .
that <name> had a money belt was true .
he had purchased it several years before , while on shore duty in the philippines .
he was a saving fellow and found the belt useful in which to place his wages and the money which he occasionally received from home .
strange as it may seem , the belt had not been taken away from him by the russians , and it now contained nearly three hundred dollars .
the money was mostly in gold ,  for he had found that gold could be used no matter where he went .
chapter xviii a clever ruse as soon as captain ponsberry was in charge of the columbia once more he set about without delay to put the schooner in proper condition for the run to nagasaki .
the <unk> foremast was allowed to remain as it was , but a temporary bowsprit was set into place , and the damage to the forecastle and to the stern repaired .
a temporary rail was also nailed up , so that there might be no danger of anybody slipping overboard .
in all this work the sailors and the ship 's carpenter did their best , and the captain and his mates helped .
sails were also sewed up , or replaced , and inside of forty-eight hours the old columbia was once more on her way .
the water taken aboard was pumped out , and the pumps were kept going two hours each morning and two hours each afternoon .
" she <name> do now , " said the captain , after the heaviest of the work was over .
" but when we reach nagasaki i 'll have to put her in the dock for regular repairs .
i should n't dare to take her to manila or to san <name> in such a condition . "
" it <name> take a long time to have the repairs made in japan , " said <name> .
" all the <unk> are busy on government work . "
" true , lad , but that can not be helped .
the law would not allow me to sign a crew with a ship that was not <unk> . "
" then we 'll have a long <unk> when we reach nagasaki . "
" exactly , <name> .
but i <name> n't keep you .
if you want to go elsewhere   " " not on another sailing vessel , captain ponsberry .
but you know how it is with <name> striker and myself .
ever since we were in our own navy we have had a hankering after warships , and   " " and you think of joining the japanese navy ? "
put in the master of the schooner , quickly .
" that 's it .
you know how i spoke of joining the army with <name> and <name> . "
" to be sure  and i told you i could n't spare you . "
" but now , if you have n't any use for me any longer   " " why , <name> , if you want to fight for japan , go ahead and fight ! "
ejaculated captain ponsberry .
" i do n't blame you .
i 'd fight myself if i was a younger man and had n't any obligations on my shoulders .
i suppose <name> is doing great things in the army and you 'd like to match him in the navy , eh ? "
" if i join the navy i 'll do my best . "
" <name> striker go with you ? "
" oh , yes , <name> and i always go together , if we can .
he was my chum when we fought under <name> and he has been my chum ever since . "
" and a good fellow , too , <name>  a man with a heart of gold .
if it wasn't that you and <name> grandon were with me , i should have made him a mate long ago . "
" i do n't doubt that , sir  and he is worthy of it . "
<name> paused for a moment .
" of course , i do n't know if they want any of us in the navy . "
" did n't you tell me before that they had several men you had met while under <name> and some your brother <name> had met while fighting in cuban waters ? "
" yes , but that was some time ago . "
" if they took those chaps then it 's likely they <name> take you now  unless , of course , they have all the men they want  which i doubt . "
" we shall not go as ordinary jackies .
<name> got a commission as a captain , and <name> thinks he might go as a gunner and i might go as an assistant gunner .
we occupied those positions before we left our navy . "
" then i should certainly strike for the positions .
they may need gunners even if they do n't need common seamen , " responded captain ponsberry .
as fortune would have it , the run to nagasaki was made without incident worthy of special mention .
once there was a scare on board , as the water in the well hole increased with alarming rapidity .
but the new leak was discovered in time , and the ship 's carpenter had little difficulty in repairing it .
they also sighted a vessel they thought might be a russian warship , but she proved instead to be a japanese coastwise freighter , carrying lumber from one port to another on the northern coast of japan .
as the columbia <name> closer to nagasaki both peterson and shamhaven grew more anxious over what was to become of them .
neither desired a term in a japanese prison , and both wondered what sort of a charge captain ponsberry and the captain of the japanese warship would prefer against them .
so far captain ponsberry had allowed them their <name> , but through the talk of a couple of sailors they presently learned that they were to be cast into the ship 's brig and placed under guard as soon as the schooner dropped anchor .
" this looks black for us , " said shamhaven , moodily .
" i wish we were out of it . "
" i haf a plan got , yes , " answered peterson .
" to get away ? "
the other nodded .
" then let me hear the plan by all means , peterson . "
" it vos  vot you call him  risky , yes .
maype ve get shot  you no like him , no ? "
" of course i do n't want to get shot .
but what is your plan ? "
" so soon like de ship come up by der harbor we <unk> our chances an' <unk> <unk> , yes . "
" and swim ashore ? "
" maype ve <unk> by some udder <unk> , yes .
of ve got money we go to leetle <unk>  gif jap <unk> money to take us avay , you see now ? "
" you mean to watch for some small japanese boat  a <unk> , eh ?
and bribe the boatman to take us to some place of safety ? "
" you got him now , yes . "
" that 's good enough if we can find the <unk> and get the money with which to do the bribing . "
" captain ponsberry got money  an ' <name> he got money pelt , like i told you . "
" oh , i have n't forgotten about that money belt , " returned shamhaven .
" and i would n't mind taking it if i could get my hands on it .
but <name> must wear it most of the time . "
" i t'ink he not put him on by der night dime , no . "
" what do you know about captain ponsberry 's money ? "
" he got money in a leetle <unk>  i see him <unk> . "
" how much do you think ? "
at this peterson shrugged his shoulders .
" no can tell dat  maype a thousand dollars . "
there was a pause , and shamhaven <name> a long breath .
" one thing is certain , " he resumed .
" i do n't intend to go to a japanese prison , or an american prison either , if i can help it , and if we cut loose here in a strange country we are bound to need more or less money with which to get along .
without money a fellow ca n't do a thing in a strange country . "
" we git money  chust you <unk> , " said peterson .
at last the columbia came into sight of the shipping of nagasaki .
but it was now dark , and a heavy fog was hanging over the harbor , so it was impossible to make the proper landing before the next day .
they came to anchor and the necessary lights were <name> out .
" this is our chance , " said shamhaven .
" it is now or never ! "
he had heard that peterson and himself were to be made close prisoners directly after supper .
he watched his chance and when nobody was looking motioned his confederate to leave the forecastle and steal silently toward the stern of the ship .
each carried a block of wood , to which was attached a bit of iron , to make it sink from sight .
" now then ! "
whispered shamhaven , and threw the block he carried overboard .
it struck the water with a loud splash , and the block carried by peterson immediately followed .
" hullo , what 's that ? "
came in the voice of <name> grandon .
" who threw something overboard ? "
" sounded like somebody jumping into the water , " replied captain ponsberry , who was on deck with the first mate .
an examination was made , but in the fog and darkness nothing could be discovered .
" it was mighty queer , " was grandon 's comment .
" somebody must have done it . "
" where are shamhaven and peterson ? "
" in the forecastle , i suppose .
do you think   " " i do n't know what to think .
see if they are there . "
at once <name> grandon ran off , and made a tour not only of the forecastle but also of the forward deck .
he called the men 's names several times , and others quickly joined in the hunt .
" they are gone ! "
he ejaculated , running back to where captain ponsberry stood .
" gone ?
then it must have been them jumping overboard that we heard ! "
" like as not  and they are a good bit away from the schooner by this time . "
" bring a lantern and we 'll take a look around . "
a lantern was brought , and a few minutes later a small boat was lowered , manned by <name> and three other sailors .
captain ponsberry went with them , and the <unk> remained out the best part of an hour .
" they 've given us the slip clean and clear , " declared the master of the columbia , on returning .
" it was a risky thing to undertake in such weather as this . "
" yes , and for all we know they may be at the bottom of the harbor , " answered <name> grandon .
" which place might be jest what they deserve , " grumbled <name> striker , as he helped to stow away the small boat once more .
chapter xix the disappearance of the enemy as soon as peterson and shamhaven threw the blocks of wood overboard they darted for the companionway of the schooner and crept noiselessly down to the cabin .
the apartment was deserted , and the swinging lamp over the center table was turned low .
on the table rested several charts which captain ponsberry had been consulting before joining <name> grandon on deck .
it was <name> 's watch below and he was improving the time by taking a <unk> nap .
he lay on the berth in his stateroom , with the door wide open to admit the fresh air .
" make no noise ! "
whispered shamhaven .
" if we are discovered the jig is up with us . "
" <name> is here , yes ? "
came from peterson .
" <unk> !
yes  over in yonder stateroom . "
they closed the door leading to the companionway and then tiptoed their way to where <name> lay .
" more than likely he keeps his money belt under his pillow when he sleeps , " said shamhaven .
" wait till i find out . "
he shoved his hand under the <unk> with caution and presently his fingers came into contact with a strip of leather and chamois .
he pulled on it gently , but it refused to budge .
" lift his head a little , " he said , and peterson started to do as requested .
but the movement , gentle as it was , caused <name> to open his eyes .
" wha  what are you doing here ? "
stammered the young second mate , when , waiting for no more words , peterson clapped a dirty hand over his mouth .
" keep still , you !
if you no keep still i hit you good , yes ! "
" confound the luck , " muttered shamhaven .
" i did n't want him to know what we were up to . "
<name> began to struggle and with an effort threw aside the hand over his mouth .
" <name>  let up ! "
he spluttered .
" i want you   help ! "
" shut up ! "
cried shamhaven , fiercely , and struck him a swinging blow in the <name> .
another blow from peterson followed , and then , with flashing lights darting through his <name> , <name> lost consciousness .
both men bent over him to see if he would move .
when he lay as still as if dead they looked at each other with satisfaction .
" he wo n't bother us any more  at least , not for awhile , " was <unk> comment .
" quick , de money belt ! "
came from peterson , and as he raised up <unk> head , shamhaven secured it and stowed it away in the bosom of his shirt .
" you no keep him ! "
he went on , in alarm , showing that he did not trust his companion in crime .
" we 'll divide up afterwards , " said shamhaven , briefly .
" now to locate the captain 's little pile . "
both tiptoed their way into captain ponsberry 's stateroom .
here there was a small safe , with the door closed .
" a safe , eh ? "
said shamhaven .
" wonder if we can open it ? "
he knelt down and tried to work the combination lock .
the safe was old and out of order and the captain had had the combination lock made as simple as possible in consequence .
soon there came a click , followed by another , and the bolts shot back .
" luck is with us ! "
cried shamhaven .
" dare is de leetle <unk> , " came from peterson , and reaching into the safe he <name> the article forth .
there was a slip string at the top which he pulled apart .
" gold ! "
he cried .
" see  dirty  forty <unk> of gold ! "
and then he shut the bag again , and placed it into his own shirt bosom .
" remember , half of that is mine , " came sharply from shamhaven .
he fancied there might be more in the bag than in the money belt .
" yes ,  an ' haf de <unk> money ist mine , yes , " returned peterson .
" right you are , peterson .
now to get away from the ship . "
" let us lock <name> in de stateroom first . "
" a good idea ! "
the door was closed and locked .
<name> still lay unconscious and there was no telling how soon he would come to his senses .
they heard the tramping on the deck and the departure of the small boat .
now those in the boat came back and the search for the missing men came to an end .
with the <unk> of a pair of cats , the evildoers crept up the companionway once more .
nobody was in sight , and they crawled rather than walked to the rail of the schooner .
both were good swimmers and not afraid to trust themselves to reach some other shipping in the harbor .
yet as an extra precaution each provided himself with a life-preserver .
" are you ready , peterson ? "
" yes . "
" then over we go . "
a small rope was handy , and lowering this , each slid along it into the waters of the harbor .
then they struck out swiftly but silently ; and in a few minutes the fog and darkness hid them completely from view .
it was the best part of an hour before <name> returned to his senses .
his head ached as if ready to split open and for several minutes he could not remember where he was or what had occurred .
" oh , my head ! "
he groaned .
" oh ! "
and he turned over and tried to sit up , with the result that he pitched out on the floor of the stateroom .
this aroused him and he got up as quickly as he could .
" those rascals attacked me ! "
he muttered .
" they struck me over the head !
i remember now !
oh , how my head spins ,  just as if i was in a <unk> !
i wonder   " he dropped on the berth and snatched away the pillow .
one glance was sufficient to show him how he had been robbed .
" that 's why they attacked me ! "
he cried .
" wonder where they are now ?
perhaps they ran away from the ship ! "
leaping up again he stepped to the door , and finding it locked , began to pound away lustily , at the same time yelling at the top of his lungs .
in a few minutes this brought down captain ponsberry , followed by <name> , who had been told to come along , the captain fearing that something had gone wrong .
" what 's up here ? "
demanded captain ponsberry as he flung open the door .
" where are they ? "
came the <unk> from <name> .
" they ?
who ? "
" peterson and shamhaven ? "
" gone  slid away in the fog . "
" they have robbed me ! "
" you do n't say ! "
ejaculated the master of the columbia .
" you are sure ? "
he went on .
" yes .
my money belt is gone .
they came while i was asleep , and when i woke up both hit me ,  and i do n't know what happened after that .
i just came to my senses and found myself locked in . "
" the villains ! "
burst in <name> .
" those chaps ought to be swung up to a <unk> ! "
the captain listened to <name> 's story and then was prompted to take a look around the other staterooms .
as a result he speedily discovered that the safe had been tampered with and that his own money was gone .
" they are worse rascals than i thought them , " said captain ponsberry , bitterly .
" i am sorry that i did not make an example of them from the start . "
there was a good deal of speculation concerning what had become of shamhaven and peterson , and another search was instituted , lasting until the following day , but not a single trace of the evildoers could be found .
" well , i am out the whole of my savings , " said <name> to <name> .
" it 's a shame , lad , " replied the yankee tar .
" but if you need ready cash do n't fail to draw on me .
as long as i have a shot in the locker half on it is yours . "
" thank you , <name> ; i know you 'd say that .
you 're the proper kind of a friend to have . "
" avast , <name> , with your compliments .
would n't you do the same fer me ? "
" indeed i would ! "
" then it ai n't worth talkin ' about .
jest the same , i <name> we run into them rascals some day ; do n't you ? "
" i do .
but more than likely they 'll give the columbia and us a wide berth after this , " returned <name> .
chapter xx <name> before admiral togo as soon as the columbia could make the proper landing , captain ponsberry went ashore and reported his arrival to the authorities , and also reported the escape of shamhaven and peterson .
the authorities had already heard of the capture of the columbia from the russians , and said that the schooner would have to remain at nagasaki until the whole case could be adjusted .
the japanese were inclined to favor both the richmond importing company and the owners of the vessel , so it was not likely that our friends would lose much in the end .
in the meantime the columbia could be put in a <unk> and given the <unk> that she needed .
" we shall do all we can to locate shamhaven and peterson and get back your money , " said an official of the secret service department .
but his hands were so full with other matters of greater importance that little attention was paid to the disappearance of the two rascals .
" well , this <name> tie me up at nagasaki for some time to come , " said captain ponsberry to <name> , on the third day after arriving at the japanese port .
" which means , i suppose , that i can join the japanese navy if i wish , " returned the young second mate , quickly .
" i do n't want to force you to leave the ship , lad .
but you said   " " i know , captain ponsberry , and i am glad of the chance to get away .
<name> and i have talked it over once more , and yesterday we met a gunner named <name> <name>  he served on the brooklyn at the time <name> did .
he is now a gun captain on board of admiral togo 's flagship , and he is almost certain he can get us good positions .
he says gunners and gunners ' assistants are just now badly needed . "
" then go by all means , <name> , and make even a bigger record for yourself than your brother <name> is making in the army .
perhaps , when this war is over , you 'll come back to the old columbia , eh ? "
" more than likely , and i guess <name> striker <name> come , too . "
what <name> had said about meeting <name> <name> was true .
as readers of a story of mine entitled " fighting in cuban waters " know , <name> had been a gun captain under commodore schley , and as such had become fairly well acquainted with <name> <name> and had also heard of <name> , who was at that time serving under admiral <name> at manila .
a detail from admiral togo 's flagship had been sent ashore at nagasaki , and <name> and <name> , as they walked through the streets , had met several of these men .
hearing two of them speaking english they had halted the pair ; and introductions had followed .
" so you are <name> <name> , " said <name> <name> .
" any relation to <name> <name> that once served on the u. s. cruiser brooklyn ? "
" <name> is my brother , " replied <name> , quickly .
" oh , so you are the chap that was cast away in the pacific and picked up by admiral <name> 's flagship , eh ? "
" the same , and this is the friend who was with me , <name> striker . "
" glad to know ye both . "
<name> <name> shook hands .
" this is my friend , <name> <name>  he hails from san <name> and is a gunner 's mate with me .
what are you doing in this corner of the earth ? "
a long talk followed , in which <name> and <name> told their story , and <name> <name> and his friend related how they had come to join the japanese navy .
" it 's this way , " said <name> .
" i 've got the fighting blood in my veins and it wo n't come out .
as soon as this war broke out , i cut sticks from 'frisco with <name> and we comes to tokio .
there i met another american who was in the navy here , and it was n't two days before we were booked for admiral togo 's flagship .
we 've been down to port <name> twice , and i reckon we 'll go again before long . "
" perhaps we 'll go up to <unk> next time , " came from <name> <name> .
" i 've heard something of <unk> that russian port . "
<name> and <name> had a couple of hours to themselves and <name> and <name> invited them over to the columbia .
in return they were asked to come over to admiral togo 's flagship , the gunners having the privilege of bringing their friends aboard during the brief stay in nagasaki harbor .
" you can come aboard to-morrow , " said <name> <name> .
" they have an inspection and drill , and you can see how they do it in the japanese navy  not but what it 's a good bit like it 's done on uncle sam's warships . "
<name> and <name> were very willing to go aboard of the japanese warship , and were taken out by <name> the next day , and introduced to several gunners and others who could speak a little english .
they were also taken before the head gunner , who took them to the commander of the warship .
" they both served under admiral <name> at manila , " said the head gunner , and this made the commander smile quietly as he shook hands and told them to make themselves at home .
" everything is as clean as a whistle , " was <name> 's comment , as they walked around the forward part of the warship and through the gun decks .
" the japs certainly know how to take care of things .
<name> , just look at how the <unk> shines ! "
" that 's the way it ought to be , " was the yankee tar 's reply .
" no <unk> , an ' i 'm glad on it .
i love a clean ship above all things . "
<name> <name> and <name> <name> were enthusiastic over the gun they commanded and explained how it worked .
it was certainly an effective weapon and <name> and <name> were thoroughly interested .
" i could handle sech a gun myself , " said <name> .
" an ' do some damage , too ; eh , <name> ? "
" anyway , i 'd like to try it , " returned the youth .
orders were now being issued for the inspection and drill , and presently nearly all on board of the flagship hurried to the main deck .
here the marines were drawn up in long lines , with the officers in their proper places .
the sailors and gunners were also at hand , each <unk> out in his best , for inspection by an admiral on any warship means a great deal .
presently admiral togo appeared , followed by several other naval officers of lesser rank .
he was in full dress , with many decorations on his breast , and carried his sword .
he proved to be a man well along in years , with a round face , and small mustache and goatee .
" he looks like a fighter ! "
whispered <name> .
" true for you , lad , " returned <name> .
" an ' i reckon he knows how to handle men . "
what our friends said about admiral togo was true .
he was a fighter and a born leader of men .
when the naval academy of japan was inaugurated he was one of the first graduates , and he was sent by the government to complete his nautical education in england , where , during 1873 and 1874 , he served on the training ship worcester , making a record for himself as a first-class pupil in every respect .
on returning home togo <unk>  to use his full name  found a great task confronting his people .
they were becoming civilized as we term civilization and needed a modern navy .
he set to work with <unk> and vigor , and then and there laid the foundation of that navy which is to-day known as one of the most effective in the world .
the navy had scarcely come into existence when there came rumors of war with <name> .
the rumors grew , and <name> became more and more hateful toward the japanese .
to the outside world it looked as if <name> , with her vast territory and her immense number of people , would swallow up the sons of <unk> bodily .
at last it was discovered that <name> was transporting troops with which to begin the war .
togo waited for no instructions from his home government .
he went at the chinese with vigor .
the war followed , and after a number of thrilling contests the japanese were victorious , and admiral togo emerged from the struggle covered with <name> .
" he is the man to lead us to victory against the russians ! "
was the cry throughout the navy , when war was declared between russia and japan , and how he sent his ships to port <name> and other places , and what effective work was done by them , has already been related .
in the whole of the japanese navy , to serve on the admiral 's flagship , the <unk> , was considered a great honor .
the inspection and drill were exceedingly interesting to <name> and <name> , and they watched both with close attention .
after it was over admiral togo addressed the men briefly and then turned to the commander of the ship .
" see , he is pointing to us ! "
whispered <name> .
" <name> me if i do n't think he is talking about us to the captain ! "
" an officer is coming , " replied <name> , and a moment later one of the admiral 's staff came hurrying to them .
" are you the two americans who served under admiral <name> at manila ? "
questioned the staff officer .
" we are , " answered <name> .
" admiral togo wishes you to come to him . "
" oh , <name> , we are going to be presented to the admiral ! "
cried <name> .
" great pewter ! "
groaned the yankee tar .
" i did n't expect this nohow .
but i do n't care , " he added , bracing up .
" he ai n't no bigger nor <name> .
come along . "
he followed the staff officer and <name> did the same .
they felt that the eyes of many of the sailors and marines were on them , and stepped out as firmly as possible .
coming up to the admiral , they took off their caps and saluted .
admiral togo surveyed the two americans with interest .
he had heard how they had come to serve under <name> at manila and he smiled pleasantly as he held out his hand , first to <name> and then to <name> .
" let me give you a welcome , my men , " said he .
" i have been told your story .
i <name> this visit to my ship has interested you . "
" very much , sir , " answered <name> .
" i liked the drill , sir , " answered <name> , with a smile .
" it was fine .
and everything is so clean !
really , i do n't think it could be cleaner ! "
at this admiral togo smiled again .
" that is a compliment ,  since it comes from one who has served in the american navy . "
he then asked them to remain where they were , while some of the men went through an exercise with their cutlasses .
there was also a gun drill , and they were asked to show how they had handled a gun during the battle of manila bay .
" you are well drilled , i can see that , " said the admiral , on dismissing them .
" they tell me you think of entering our navy .
if you wish to do so i think likely we can find suitable openings for you . "
chapter xxi letters of interest the <unk> of <name> and <name> striker into the japanese navy came sooner than anticipated .
a new warship was being fitted out at a harbor some forty miles from nagasaki , and <name> <name> and <name> <name> were transferred to this .
two new gun crews were badly needed on the new ship , and inside of forty-eight hours our friends had signed the muster roll and were put into training , under <name> .
the positions occupied were those of gunner and gunner 's mate .
" hurrah for <unk> ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically .
" <name> , after this we have got to learn to yell <unk> !  in true japanese style . "
" this gun is a beauty , " replied the yankee tar , as he looked the piece over .
" i reckon as i can make her do considerable damage if i get the chance . "
" and i 'll help all i can , " said <name> .
" wo n't <name> and <name> be surprised when they hear of this ? "
he added .
" they might know you 'd do something of the sort . "
" that 's so , too .
by the way , i 'm going up to the post-office to-day and see if there are any letters . "
much to the satisfaction of our friends they found over a score of men on the warship who could speak english .
some , of course , could speak but little , yet they could make themselves understood .
on the other hand , both <name> and <name> began to pick up the japanese language remarkably fast .
" if we keep at this for six months we 'll be regular japanese , " said the youth .
" it 's not so hard as i thought it would be . "
they found the discipline on the warship very strict and were called on to " toe the <name> " continually .
yet all the officers were as considerate as they were firm , so there was little of hardship .
when <name> called at the post-office for letters he found two good-sized epistles awaiting him .
one was from his brother <name> , and ran , in part , as follows : " there is nothing particularly new in this part of the globe .
i am doing very well in my new business and it looks now as if i should make a big thing of it .
i rather think i am more cut out for work on land than for life on shipboard , although i do n't regret the time i spent in the navy .
" uncle job is feeling very well these days and is building a new wing to the old house  going to put in a library of good books he tells me .
he is as dear an old chap now as anybody would want for an uncle .
" i suppose you <name> hear from <name> and <name> .
i am expecting a letter every day .
it 's queer you did n't go with them , but i suppose the old columbia with her crew suits you better . "
" i am glad everything is all right at home , " thought <name> , as he finished reading the communication .
" a new wing to the house , eh ?
uncle job must be spreading himself .
reckon he has found out there is something more to live for in this world than mere money . "
the second letter was from <name> , as he could tell by the handwriting .
it had been on the way a long time and had been sent to half a dozen places , including manila .
there was a great deal about life in the japanese army , and also a full description of the capture of <unk> .
<name> then continued : " we are now on guard a few miles outside of the city .
our camp stretches for many miles , and we are doing all in our power to strengthen our position .
what the next move <name> be there is no telling .
one report is , that our particular command <name> help to <name> the russians to <unk> , while another report has it that we are to march southward , to aid in the attempt to take port <name> .
" i have already told you what trouble <name> had with that rascally russian merchant , <name> snokoff , and with <unk> confederate , captain barusky , of the russian army .
well , at <unk> we found snokoff disguised as a chinaman , and <name> made the fellow pay over all that was coming to him for the richmond importing company .
in the attempt to capture snokoff , <name> shot him in the leg .
it was only a slight wound , but the russian was as mad as a hornet , and he vowed he would get square some time .
he is now in the hospital here , but they expect to let him leave in a few days .
he really ought to be put under arrest , but as he has paid up the money he owed , there does n't seem to be any way of holding him .
it 's out of the question to go to court with the case .
i helped <name> to put snokoff under guard , and he is as angry at me as he is at <name> .
i do n't know if he <name> dare to do anything or not , but both of us are keeping our eyes open . "
<name> read this letter twice before he stowed it away .
he was always interested in war news and he thought the description of the great battle of <unk> very realistic .
he shook his curly head when he thought of <name> snokoff .
" he must be an underhanded rascal if ever there was one , " he mused .
" and to think he disguised himself as a chinaman !
i 'll wager <name> thought it a fine thing to expose him and make him pay up .
but he and <name> had better look out , or snokoff and that captain barusky may cause them a lot of trouble . "
<name> had an hour to himself , and he spent the time in answering both letters , telling briefly what had happened to him since the trip to manila and how he and <name> were now in service on board of the japanese warship shohirika .
he added that he liked the position of <unk> mate very much , and that he meant to make a record for himself if given the opportunity to do so .
he also told about the doings of shamhaven and peterson , and said he hoped to bring them to justice , although he realized that looking for them was as bad as " looking for a <name> on the ocean bottom . "
the letters finished , he addressed and posted them , and then he and <name> took a short stroll through nagasaki , past the many curious shops , and the fine residences .
some of the shop windows displayed flaring war pictures , done in glaring colors ,  all telling of tremendous japanese victories on land and sea .
" they certainly believe in tooting their own horn , " said <name> , with a laugh over one of the pictures .
" just see this one , <name>  one japanese officer mowing down three russians with his sword ! "
" they ai n't no worse nor we had at home during the spanish war , lad .
i know one picture i see o ' a rough rider riding down half a dozen spanish soldiers .
an ' the truth o ' the matter is , them rough riders did n't have no horses at all but fought on foot ! "
" you 're right , <name> .
we 'll have to put all such pictures down as freaks of the artist 's imagination .
but i guess i know why some of them are put out  to draw the young fellows into the army and navy . "
" right ye are .
some fellers seeing a picture like that want to march to <name> right off ,  an ' so they go an ' enlist .
when it comes to <unk> an ' black coffee   " " hold on , <name> .
remember you are in japan .
here it is rice and tea . "
" so it is , <name> .
say , but i had to laugh yesterday , when i see some of them jackies on board o ' our ship gettin ' out their <unk> with tea . "
" it did look funny .
but they do the same thing in the army , so i have been told .
they can make the japanese soldier and sailor do everything as we do it but give up his tea . "
" well , i reckon tea is better nor rum . "
" certainly it is ,  and if i were an officer i 'd let them have all the tea they wanted  if they would fight any better for it . "
" those russian sailors and soldiers drink an awful lot of <unk> .
i should think they would try to stop that .
a <unk> sailor or soldier is n't of any account . "
" they are so used to having it , i 've been told , that to stop it would bring on a regular mutiny .
it 's hard to break off using a thing when you are used to it . "
" right ye are , lad ; a habit if it ai n't proper is something awful . "
all was bustle throughout nagasaki , for several regiments of soldiers had come in , bound for some transports which were to take them to <unk> .
banners were flying everywhere , and from a distance came the music of a band .
" wonder how soon we <name> leave , " said <name> , when he and his old friend were returning to the warship .
" now that we have enlisted , i 'd like to see some fighting . "
" maybe we 'll get more fighting than we want , lad .
but i 'd like to get into it myself , " continued the yankee gunner , with a grin .
two days more were spent at nagasaki , and then , on a clear morning , the shohirika left the harbor and steamed off in company with two sister ships .
they were to join a squadron bound for the western coast of <unk> , but where they were to go after that there was no telling .
captain ponsberry came to see <name> and <name> off .
" take good care of yourselves , " said the master of the columbia .
" an ' teach them russians the lesson they deserve . "
" we expect to do our duty , " answered <name> .
life on the japanese warship proved to be very much like life in the american navy .
there were hours set apart for various drills and exercises .
each day they had to go through the movements of handling the gun , fighting with cutlasses , putting out a fire , and manning the small boats .
they also had to keep their ditty bags and grass <unk> in good order , also their eating utensils , and each had to do his share of cleaning up .
twice a week the ship 's surgeon examined each man , to see that he was perfectly healthy .
" i like this keeping things clean , " said <name> .
" it is bound to make for good health . "
" they tell me that japanese sailors and soldiers are among the <unk> in the world , " answered <name> .
in a few days the southern point of <unk> was passed and the bow of the warship was pointed toward the eastern coast of <unk> .
they were now getting close to the <unk> and the lookout was constantly watching for the appearance of the ships of the enemy .
" we 'll have a fight before very long  i can feel it in my bones , " declared <name> .
and he was right ; but before telling of that contest , and what surprising results it led to , we shall have to tell of something else which occurred , to delight <name> exceedingly .
chapter xxii a meeting and a plot " some japanese transports are coming up , " said <name> , two days later .
" six of them , and they are crowded to the rails with soldiers . "
" i reckon we are to act as an escort to them , " replied <name> .
" they would need an escort , if they fell in with a russian cruiser or two . "
the japanese transports were bound for the coast of <unk> , to land near the village of <unk> .
soon they fell in behind the shohirika ; and then those on the warship knew that they were going to go close to shore , if not to make an actual landing .
a fog came up that night , which made the transports hold off .
but the next day was as bright and clear as before , and about noon land was sighted to the westward .
a patrol boat was sent ahead and came back stating that all was clear for a landing .
then the warships went closer and the transports followed .
on the following day <name> found himself on shore  having been taken along by one of the officers of the ship to interview an english merchant who wished to sell some goods to the japanese .
the officer could speak some english , but wanted somebody along who could help him out in case he could not make himself clearly understood .
the landing was at a small chinese town which was partly in ashes  the russians having tried to burn it down before leaving .
there were a dozen shops , but all were closed and with the windows boarded up .
many of the chinese had fled to the country beyond ; and a japanese regiment was on guard to preserve order and to keep the chunchuses , ( chinese brigands ) from <unk> the place .
" this shows what war <name> do , " thought <name> , as he walked along beside the japanese naval officer .
" i suppose some of the chinese have lost all they possessed  and through no fault of their own either . "
the business with the english merchant was transacted quicker than anticipated , and , not caring to go back to his ship at once , the naval officer visited the camp of the japanese regiment , taking <name> with him .
" we expect another detachment here this afternoon , " said one of the regimental commanders to the naval officer .
" they are to escort a powder train through the mountains . "
a little while later the detachment came in on foot , looking somewhat tired and <name> from a long tramp through an exceedingly rough country .
as the soldiers came to a halt in the public square of the seaport village , <name> uttered a cry of amazement : " <name> ! "
" why , <name> , can it be you ? "
came in a tone of astonishment , and on the instant <name> <name> rushed forward and caught his brother by the hands .
" i must be dreaming ! "
" i guess i 'm dreaming myself ! "
said <name> , and gave his brother a warm hug .
" this beats the dutch !
i thought you were at <unk> .
how are you and how did you get here ? "
" one question at a time , please , " returned <name> , with a happy smile .
" i'm pretty well , although i had a little dose of fever a couple of weeks ago .
our japanese doctor fixed me up in double-quick time .
our command was ordered down here to look after a powder train .
there was a report that either the russians or the chunchuses were going to try to capture it or blow it up .
now , how have you been , and what are you doing here ?
i thought the old columbia was at nagasaki . "
" you want to know as much as i do , <name> . "
there was a pause and both laughed merrily , they felt so happy .
" i 'm as sound as a fiddle .
the columbia is at nagasaki and likely to stay there for some time .
allow me to introduce myself , <name> <name> , gunner 's mate aboard of the mikado 's cruiser shohirika .
my head gunner is <name> striker , <unk> . "
" never ! "
burst from <name> .
" well , this certainly is news .
so you and <name> enlisted ?
have you had any fighting ? "
" not exactly .
but we have seen some rough times , " answered <name> , and then , as soon as <name> could get away for a quiet half-hour , he related his story in detail , just as i have set it down in these pages .
" you are assuredly a lucky chap , <name> , not to be in a russian prison this minute , " said his brother , after the young sailor had finished .
" perhaps i am lucky , <name> .
but it was n't much of luck to have that shamhaven and peterson walk off with my money belt . "
" that is so , but as the amount taken was n't a fortune i should n't worry about it .
i can let you have any money you need . "
" i do n't need any , and , besides , <name> is acting as my banker .
but now tell me about yourself . "
" there is n't very much to tell , outside of what i put down in that letter you received .
as you know , <name> and i are both attached to this command of <name> okopa . "
" where is <name> now ? "
" his company was to bring up the rear .
they 'll be here very shortly .
since the battle of <unk> we have been on special duty , looking after the pack and powder trains , and have seen very little of fighting .
we are <unk> our lines daily , and i think the russians must be doing the same .
i expect some more heavy fighting soon , unless <name> steps in and puts a stop to everything .
the nights are already rather cool , " added <name> .
it was half an hour later that the company under <name> came in , having in their custody two chinese bandits that had tried to steal four horses belonging to two japanese army carts .
" so it 's really you , <name> ! "
cried the young southerner , as he shook hands .
" i 'm mightily glad to see you and see you looking so well .
i suppose <name> has told you all the news . "
" yes , and <name> has been telling some too , " put in <name> .
" he has seen almost as much of the russians as we have . "
and then <name> 's story had to be told again .
" i do n't know where we shall go after we leave here , " said the young sailor .
" are you going back to <unk> ? "
" we do n't know that either .
our orders are to escort the powder train wherever it may be sent , " said <name> .
for two days the japanese warship remained in the harbor of the seaport village and during that time <name> managed to see quite a good deal of <name> and <name> .
he wished he could take them on board of the cruiser , but this was not permitted .
on the third day the shohirika received orders from a dispatch boat which steamed into the harbor , and an hour later the anchors were hove <unk> and she steamed away , carrying <name> and his old yankee friend along .
<name> and <name> stood on a dock watching her departure .
they waved their handkerchiefs at <name> and he waved his own in return .
" i wonder when i 'll see <name> again , " mused <name> .
he felt rather sober at the parting from his younger brother .
" oh , you 'll see him again before long , " answered <name> , trying to be cheerful .
" maybe not .
it all depends upon where that cruiser sails to .
she may go half around the world . "
" more than likely she has been sent to take part in the bombardment of port <name> . "
" do you really think we 'll be sent to port <name> , <name> ? "
" it is not unlikely , <name> . "
the pair watched the cruiser fade away in the distance , and then returned to that part of the village in which <name> okopa 's command had been located .
" by the way , " said <name> , as they hurried along .
" there is one thing i forgot to tell you .
meeting <name> drove it completely out of my mind .
on the way to this village we stopped at a place called <unk> , and there i met , whom do you suppose ? "
" i do n't know , i 'm sure . "
" that rascal <name> snokoff .
he was at his same old tricks  selling things to the inhabitants at exorbitant prices .
when he saw me he shook his fist at me and my men and then ran away and hid . "
" why did n't you root him out , <name> ? "
" what good would it have done ?
besides , i did n't have time .
the fight with the brigands made us lose three hours .
but do you know , i think snokoff has it in for me . "
" yes , and in for me , too , " added <name> .
" he has n't forgotten how i brought along the guard that placed him under temporary arrest . "
there was no time to say more , for the command was to move in half an hour and both of the young captains had to round up their men for that purpose .
the powder train was at rest outside of the village and the men were scattered here , there , and everywhere .
evening found the command to which <name> and <name> belonged ten miles on their way through the mountains .
only the officer in charge of the powder train knew the destination of the precious stores .
the train consisted of eighteen carts , each pulled by four horses .
although none in <name> okopa 's command knew it , the train was followed by a chinaman named <unk> lung , who lived in <unk> , the place where <name> had seen <name> snokoff .
<unk> lung was well known to <name> snokoff and had been asked by the rascally russian to keep his eyes on <name> and on <name> and to report their movements .
he had watched <unk> meeting with <name> and <name> and heard something of what was said and had thus managed to make out that two of the party were brothers .
as the powder train approached <unk> , <unk> lung went ahead to find <name> snokoff .
this was not difficult , as he knew exactly where the latter was hiding .
a conference lasting an hour ensued .
" do as you have promised and you shall have fifty <name> , " said <name> snokoff .
" you <name> not fail to pay ? "
queried <unk> lung .
" by the heads of my ancestors i promise it , " was the rascally <unk> answer .
" 't is enough .
i shall do as i have promised , " returned the chinaman .
and he bowed himself from <name> snokoff 's presence .
left to himself , the rascally russian rubbed his hands gleefully .
" <name> , i trust he is successful ! "
he muttered to himself .
" once pennington and <name> are in the power of us russians i shall show them what it means to insult and degrade a snokoff ! "
chapter xxiii the attack in the dark two days later <name> and <name> were seated in their tent talking about the meeting with <name> when one of the guards came in and saluted .
" a messenger to see captain <name> and captain pennington , " said the guard .
" show him in , " returned <name> , briefly , thinking it was a simple message about camp duties .
he was rather surprised when a chinaman entered , bowing low as he did so .
" dis <unk> <unk> ? "
asked the newcomer .
" that is my name . "
" dis <unk> <unk> ? "
" yes , " answered <name> .
" sailor man send <name> wow , " went on the chinaman .
" sailor man want see <unk> . "
he pointed to the two young captains .
" sailor man say he <unk> you . "
and now he pointed at <name> alone .
" said he was my brother ? "
cried the young captain .
the messenger nodded .
" name <unk> same <name> <unk> . "
" gracious me ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" <name> , what can this mean ?
i thought <name> sailed away on that warship . "
" so did i .
but she may be back in port . "
" sailor man hurt . "
the chinaman pointed to his side .
" sick  he shot  say you <unk> to-night . "
" sick ?
shot ? "
repeated <name> , and a cold chill went down his backbone .
" that is the worst yet .
where is he ? "
" big walk down by the sea .
<name> wow show .
but must pay  <name> wow poor people . "
" oh , i 'll pay you , " answered <name> , hurriedly .
" <name> , do you think i can get away ? "
" sailor man say <unk> <unk> , " put in the messenger .
" something is wrong , that is certain , " came from <name> .
he eyed the chinaman closely .
" there is no mistake about this ? "
at this <name> wow shrugged his <name> shoulders and looked blank .
" no see <unk> .
see sailor <unk> . "
" i guess he is all right , " put in <name> .
" something has happened to poor <name> .
i wonder if i can get away at once ? "
" let us see the <name> about this . "
<name> hurried off and caught <name> okopa in his own tent .
as the command was not to move until noon of the next day both readily obtained permission to absent themselves until that time .
" but be careful , " said the <name> .
" this may be some chinese trick . "
" we 'll be on our guard , " answered <name> .
the chinese messenger had come in on foot .
he said he was hungry and was given something to eat .
then the three set off , the messenger carrying a knapsack filled with rations , and each of the young captains carrying his sword and his pistol .
they tried to learn from <name> wow how far they would have to travel , but the chinaman either could not or would not inform them .
" perhaps it might have been as well to have taken a detachment of one company along , " suggested <name> .
" i must say , i do n't like the looks of this . "
they were now a good mile away from camp , and in a location that appeared lonely enough .
" well , we are moving down to the seacoast , " returned <name> .
he was taking careful note of the direction they were pursuing .
after that they journeyed along for a good two hours without saying much .
they stepped along briskly , for <name> wanted to learn just what had happened to his brother .
for all he knew to the contrary , <name> might be mortally wounded .
presently they came to a spot in the road where there were a number of dense trees .
<name> wow began to cough loudly .
" what 's the matter ? "
demanded <name> .
for some reason he did not trust the chinaman .
" <unk> fly in float , " was the answer , and <name> wow coughed again .
then he walked on , and they came behind him .
but <name> <name> his pistol and motioned for <name> to do the same .
" i may be mistaken , but we may be walking into a trap , " he whispered .
" why , <name> , i do n't   " began <name> , when without warning a heavy object dropped upon his head from the limb of one of the trees and bore him to the ground .
another object dropped on <name> , but he squirmed from under ,  to find himself confronted by several chunchuses .
a cry went up , and a crashing was heard in the bushes back of the trees .
" a trick , <name> , just as i suspected ! "
ejaculated the young southerner , and he discharged his pistol point-blank at the chinese <unk> in front of him .
this done he made a leap to one side , hurling over <name> wow as he did so , and darted forward into some bushes .
a shot was aimed at him , but did no injury , and he kept on , running as hard as he could .
in the meantime <name> did his best to get up .
but one man was on his shoulders and another had him by the legs , so to move was next to impossible .
then , as he continued to struggle , he received a heavy kick from a wooden shoe which stretched him out like a log .
" he is out of the fight now , " said one of the chunchuses , as he bent over <name> .
" go after the other .
do not let him escape if you can help it .
americans are worth a good deal to us in these days ! "
three of the brigands remained to guard <name> and the others made after <name> .
but they could not catch the young southerner , and after a long <name> they came back .
" he has gone back to his camp , " said one of the chunchuses to his chief .
" he <name> have his friends about our ears very shortly . "
as soon as this news was received , <name> 's hands and feet were bound , and four of the chinamen caught him up as if he were a dead animal and hoisted him on their shoulders .
off they set at a <unk> , with the remaining brigands around them .
it was the <unk> over the rough mountainous road which finally brought the young captain to his senses .
at first he did not realize that he was on the move .
" <name> ! "
he called faintly .
" <name> ! "
nobody answered him , and now he essayed to sit up .
he could not budge and consequently began to struggle .
" be still ! "
cried one of the chunchuses , in chinese .
" where am i ?
what are you doing to me ? "
queried <name> .
for answer he received a good shaking and was then dumped on the ground .
his feet were liberated , and the chief of the chinese brigands ordered him to move along , pointing the end of his sword at the prisoner as he did so .
" where is my friend ? "
asked <name> .
" he is dead , " said the chief , laconically .
" dead ! "
burst out the young captain .
his heart seemed to become like a lump of lead .
<name> , his own true chum , dead !
it was too horrible to believe .
" yes , and you <name> be unless you walk on , " added the chief of the chunchuses .
there was no help for it , and , bruised and bleeding , the young captain took up the march , with his enemies on all sides of him .
the gait was a rapid one , and before they came to a halt once more he was all but exhausted .
" where are you taking me ? "
he asked .
" wait and see . "
the chief of the chunchuses grinned wickedly .
" i shall have to trouble you for your valuables , " he went on , in his native tongue , and without further ado stripped <name> of his possessions , including his watch , money , ring , and sword .
there was no use protesting , and therefore the young captain did not attempt it .
he was marched along a marshy path , and presently came in sight of the ocean and a small bay , where two sailing ships and a small steamer lay at anchor .
a shrill whistle sounded out , and this was answered by somebody on the steamer .
then a small boat put in to shore , carrying four sailors and an officer .
as soon as the officer landed , he was called aside by the chief of the chunchuses , and a conference lasting several minutes followed .
" it shall be as you say , <name> fee , " said the officer , in russian .
" it is too bad you did not get the other , too .
i know <name> snokoff , and captain barusky too , and there <name> be money in this .
yes , i 'll take him on board at once .
you had better watch out that the soldiers do not get after you . "
" trust <name> fee to take care of himself , " said the chief of the chunchuses .
with scant ceremony <name> was conducted to the small boat and told to get in .
he asked where they were going to take him , but could get no satisfaction .
as soon as the steamer was reached , he was conducted to an empty stateroom and locked in .
" this is the worst yet ! "
he muttered , as he sat down .
" i suppose they intend to <name> me miles and miles away .
poor <name> !
i never thought he would be killed in such a fashion as this !
what <unk> these chinese brigands are !
it 's a wonder they did n't kill me too !
can that story about <name> be true ? "
there was a little water in the stateroom , and as his hands had been released , <name> bathed his wounds and bound them up as best he could .
he heard the steamer move away from the shore , and soon the steady pounding of the engines proved that she was forging ahead at her best rate of speed .
he was a prisoner of the enemy , and what they were going to do with him was a question still to be answered .
chapter xxiv the defense of the powder train after firing on the chinese brigands as already described , <name> plunged into the brushwood which was not over half a dozen yards distant .
he heard the shots discharged at him in return , but fortunately every one went wide of its <name> .
once in the brushwood he did not stop , but continued on his way for several rods .
then he paused , wondering if <name> was anywhere in the vicinity .
" i <name> they did n't kill him , " he murmured .
" what a trap that was , and how easily we walked into it ! "
he waited and listened , but nobody came near him .
then , with caution , he pushed ahead , until he gained once more the road leading back to the temporary camp occupied by the powder train and the detachment guarding it .
following this , he ran on at full speed until the welcome camp-fires greeted him .
" <name> okopa , we have been attacked by chunchuses ! "
he exclaimed , as he rushed up to the officer 's quarters .
and in a brief manner he explained the situation so far as he knew it .
the japanese <name> had taken a strong liking to <name> and <name> , and he lost no time in ordering out a company to round up the chinese brigands if they could be located .
it was <name> 's own command and he was given permission to remain out the whole night and the next day if necessary .
the young southerner went at the task with vigor , for he realized that every moment was precious .
he explained the situation to his men , and they set off at double-quick to where the attack had been made .
as was to be expected , the spot was deserted .
by torchlight they saw the evidences of the struggle which had taken place .
in one spot was a pool of blood , left by the <unk> whom <name> had shot in the shoulder .
" they went off in this direction , " said one of the soldiers , who was good at tracing footsteps .
he pointed to a side road , and along this they ran , keeping eyes and ears on the alert , so as to avoid anything in the nature of a surprise .
two hours later the company found itself on the seashore .
but chunchuses and vessels were gone and to where it was impossible to find out .
but on the beach <name> picked up an empty pocketbook which he knew was <unk> property .
" they brought him here most likely , " he said .
" see , here are the marks of a rowboat , and of many feet .
they have gone off on the water . "
" then the hunt is at a standstill , " returned his second in command .
the young captain was unwilling to believe this , and the remainder of the night , and the next forenoon , were spent in an eager search after the enemy .
but it was useless ; and at last <name> , sick at heart , ordered his men to return to the camp .
on the following day the powder train moved onward once more .
the first lieutenant of <name> 's company took command of the body , and <name> was marked " missing " on the roll .
" it is certainly too bad , and i sympathize with you , captain pennington , " said <name> okopa .
" captain <name> is a fine fellow . "
" it takes all the vigor out of me , " replied <name> .
" <name> and i were like two brothers . "
but <name> was given no time in which to grieve over <unk> disappearance .
two days later , the powder train was attacked by a detachment of the russians , who seemed to spring out of the very ground .
one of the wagons loaded with powder was blown to atoms , killing two horses and three soldiers .
" <unk> !  " cried the japanese , and when the order was given they attacked the enemy with vigor .
it was a hot fight , lasting half an hour , and the russians were driven among some high hills , backed up by several mountains .
as the powder train had to go through one of the mountain passes so close at hand , the soldiers were sent ahead , to clear the way of all russians that might appear .
this was dangerous work , for the enemy had the advantage of the higher position .
but the japanese were undaunted , and rushed up one slope after another with a vigor and animation that was surprising .
" ca n't hold them back , when once they get started , " said <name> , to the <name> .
" they are like our southern bloodhounds , when once they strike the scent . "
" and that is the way to win victory , " answered <name> okopa .
not long after this <name> found himself at the foot of a steep hill with his company .
at the top of the hill were a number of great <unk> and behind these some of the russians were in hiding , sending down a spiteful fire whenever the opportunity presented itself .
" we must dislodge those fellows , " said <name> okopa .
" it is very dangerous work .
do you think you can accomplish it , captain pennington ? "
" i can try , " answered <name> , modestly , and ordered his company forward .
he turned them slightly to the left , for here a fringe of thin brushwood offered a shelter that was not great , but much better than none .
" <name> okopa expects us to take this hill , " he said , in the best japanese he could muster .
" let us do our best ! "
" <unk> !  " came the rallying cry from the men , and up the slope they rushed , with <name> at their side .
crack !
crack !
went the rifles of the russians , and then , without warning , several shells were sent up .
one man of <name> 's company was killed and two wounded , but they did not waver .
passing the brushwood , they ran out boldly on the slope above them .
many of the rocks at the top of the hill were loose , and as the japanese came closer , the enemy began to send them down in a shower which was highly dangerous to those below .
" beware of the stones ! "
cried <name> .
he had hardly spoken when he saw that he would have to look after his own safety .
the russians were working over a rock that weighed several hundreds of pounds .
all at once the mass broke loose .
there was a yell of delight from above , and then the big <unk> came rolling straight for <name> .
had it touched him he must surely have been crushed to death .
but the young southerner was as cool as he was quick .
pausing to make certain which way the big stone was coming down , he made a quick leap in the opposite direction .
then the <unk> went bounding past him , to crash into some small trees at the bottom of the hill .
" are you hurt , captain ? "
asked his lieutenant .
" no , " answered <name> .
then he leaped to the front once more .
" come ! "
he cried .
" <unk> !  forward for the mikado ! "
and on the whole company went as before , firing rapidly as they did so .
the russians clung to the hilltop a few minutes longer , and then , as the first of the japanese gained a footing there , they broke and fled in wild disorder down the other side of the hill , and into the woods to the northward .
the japanese pursued them for two hours but could not catch them , and at last the <name> was abandoned .
in this skirmish , called the battle of <unk> , the japanese lost in killed and wounded four men , and the russians seven .
three of the czar 's soldiers were also taken prisoners .
after that the powder train had no more difficulty , and four days later reached its destination , which was the village of <unk> , where the japanese had established something of a base of supplies for that portion of the army which was moving southward to join in the siege of port <name> .
at <unk> , <name> okopa 's command received orders to go into camp instead of returning to the vicinity of <unk> .
" this looks to me as if we were to be transferred to the army in the south , " said the <name> , after communicating the news to <name> .
" well , i should n't mind helping to take port <name> , " returned the young southerner .
" if you <name> remember , it was my treatment by the russians at that place which caused me to take up arms against them . "
" so you said before , captain pennington .
but do not imagine that the taking of port <name> <name> be easy .
the russians have fortified it in every possible manner . "
" yes ,  they were doing that before i came away from there . "
" for months they have been strengthening their fortifications , and getting in ammunition and supplies in secret .
their chain of forts extend , so i have been told , for twenty miles and more outside of the city , and being in a mountainous country , they <name> be hard to reduce . "
" do n't you think we can capture the place ? "
demanded <name> .
" capture it ?
most assuredly , captain .
but it <name> mean a great destruction of life , " returned <name> okopa , gravely .
what the <name> said about the russians <unk> port <name> was true .
lieutenant-general <unk> , the russian commander at that place , had under him sixty thousand men , the very flower of the russian army .
on the side of the sea the town was fortified at a dozen points , only three of which had been thus far captured under the japanese army led by general <unk> .
to the northward and the westward were some twenty defenses , set among the mountains where they were next to impossible to reach .
in a work of this kind , it is impossible to relate in detail all of the many battles fought over the possession of port <name> .
the first assault was made in february by admiral togo 's fleet , and the naval conflict was kept up for almost three months after that .
in the meantime a japanese army under general <unk> landed at <unk> , and after several battles at <unk> and <unk> hill , drove the russians back to their mountain defenses and took possession of the railroad running to <unk> and <unk> .
thus port <name> was cut off from almost all communication with the outside world .
chapter xxv <unk> a port <name> fort <name> felt very happy after having met <name> and <name> .
he had been afraid he should find that his brother or his friend was wounded , even though no mention of such an occurrence had been made in the letter he had received .
he knew from experience that <name> was in the habit of making light of things that went wrong .
" i suppose it did your heart good to meet 'em both , " said <name> , after the warship was on the way .
" you 're right , <name> ; it was a regular touch of old times . "
" wish i had seen 'em myself . "
" both wanted to be remembered to you . "
<name> paused for a moment .
" by the way , i wonder where we are bound now ? "
" ca n't say as to that , lad  secret orders , i reckon , " answered the old tar .
the order to sail was evidently an important one , for scarcely was the shohirika out of sight of land than all steam was crowded on .
the <unk> were also doubled , and when night came the strictest watch possible was maintained .
yet , with it all , several days passed without anything out of the ordinary happening .
drills and exercises went on as before , and both <name> and <name> made themselves familiar with all parts of the warship .
both spent much time in <unk> themselves with such orders as were given to them in japanese , so that they might not be too " green , " as <name> termed it , if put to the test .
during those days spent on shipboard matters concerning the great war were moving forward steadily .
in the vicinity of <unk> both the japanese and the russians made several movements to better their positions .
this brought on a few skirmishes and one heavy battle , in which the losses were several hundreds on each side .
there was also an advance on the outer forts of port <name> , and a fair-sized hill was captured by the mikado 's men , who , however held the place only at an enormous loss of life .
in moving on the port the japanese found they would have to do a great amount of <unk> and <unk> , all of which consumed time .
on the ocean the two nations were equally active .
both took several prizes of war , and in an encounter with the <unk> squadron a russian warship was hopelessly disabled and a japanese cruiser was all but sunk .
another ship belonging to admiral togo 's fleet struck a mine outside of port <name> and had to be sent back to japan for repairs .
so far the weather had been warm , but autumn was now at hand and before long the nights became cold and raw .
" this war wo n't be finished this <name> , " said more than one .
" we are in for another year of it , sure . "
the shohirika had been summoned to join the fleet <unk> before port <name> .
two days before that station was reached they fell in with a sister ship which brought the news of an encounter with a russian battleship carrying some troops from siberia .
both warships had suffered and become separated in the darkness .
" this war is certainly warming up , " said <name> .
" i <name> we see some fighting before it is over . "
" maybe we 'll see more of it than you wish , " said <name> , grimly .
" do n't you worry  we 'll see a whole lot , " put in <name> <name> , who was sitting on a ditty chest , playing <unk> with <name> <name> .
" just wait till we get under admiral togo 's eye  he 'll make us be up and doing . "
the chance to see some of the war came the next day , when they were ordered to bombard one of the forts to the north of port <name> proper .
as soon as they came within four miles of the fort they received a reception which was as warm as it was exciting .
" now , here is where we show what we can do ! "
cried <name> , as the orders came to begin firing , and the whole gun company jumped in to assist him .
the magazines were opened up , the <unk> set to work , and soon the first real shell  not a mere blank for practicing  came up and was run into the gun .
then the <unk> was swung to and locked , the electric connection set , and <name> sighted the piece with care , after having first received the proper distance from the <unk> in the tops .
as soon as the " sight " was " covered " the button was pressed , and bang !  went the gun with a concussion that shook the whole ship .
other guns followed in rapid succession , until <name> had to stuff cotton in his ears to keep himself from becoming deaf .
as soon as the gun was discharged , it was opened to let the gases out and then cleaned with wet <unk> and flushed with running water to cool the barrel .
the bombardment lasted for an hour , and during that time the fort was hit in a dozen places .
sand , dirt , and rocks flew in all directions , and once there came a flash which told of an explosion of a quantity of powder .
" if we could only hit the magazine it would be good-by to that fort , " said <name> , but this was not to be .
after the first few shots the fort had remained silent , but now , when the shohirika was about to retire , the gunners opened up once more , and a rain of shot and shell flew all around the warship .
one struck the bow of the vessel , tearing off a few feet of the forward deck and another entered the forward turret , killing one of the <unk> assistants .
" we can be thankful we were n't in that turret , " said <name> , when he received the latter news .
" yes , indeed ! "
murmured <name> , and could not repress a shiver .
" i can tell you , it 's mighty risky work after all ! "
he added , soberly .
" well , we 've got one advantage over those fellows , " put in <name> , after the firing had come to an end , and the warship was fast getting out of range .
" we can run away , while they have got to stay right where they are . "
" oh , they can run away too , " said <name> .
" not unless they abandon their fort ,  and that would be just as if we should abandon our ship . "
the work at the gun had been severe , and after the bombardment was over <name> was glad to clean up and take a rest .
the perspiration , <unk> , and smoke had made him look like a negro , and he used up several buckets of water before he got himself into as cleanly a condition as was habitual with him .
<name> also took a " <unk> down , " as he called it , and so did the others .
what amazed <name> more than anything was the quietness of the japanese sailors .
now that the bombardment was ended they said scarcely a word about it , but went on exactly as before .
" they are the most matter-of-fact chaps i ever saw ! "
he declared .
" i believe if the ship blew up they would say 'very sorry ' and swim away .
now on one of uncle <name> 's ships the men would be all woke up and out for a <unk> .
<name> says it 's the same way in the army .
if they get excited at all they always seem to be sorry for it afterwards ! "
" that 's what ye call a characteristic o ' the race , i reckon , " returned <name> .
" they 're taught to act that way from <unk> .
it ai n't polite nor high-toned to git excited .
the only thing they kin yell is <unk> !  an' they let thet out loud enough , goodness knows ! "
" i ca n't understand why we did n't keep at that fort , " came from <name> .
" i was just getting the range beautifully when orders came to shut down . "
" well , there must be a reason for it , <name> , " answered <name> .
there was a reason for it .
admiral togo had just received word that certain ships of the port <name> squadron were going to make an attempt to break out of the harbor , either that night or the next day .
consequently the shohirika was needed further down the coast , and steamed away in that direction as rapidly as her somewhat limited supply of coal permitted .
" i do n't think the navy <name> ever find its way into port <name> harbor , " said <name> , later on , after studying a map of that locality .
" there are too many forts on the hills outside of the town .
they could smash our ships to <unk> if we got too close . "
" trust admiral togo to know what he is doing , " answered <name> <name> .
" he wo n't go too close .
at the same time he ai n't going to let the russian ships get away any more than schley and sampson let admiral cervera get away from <name> harbor in cuba . "
" it 's the army that <name> make port <name> a hot place to live in , " came from <name> <name> .
" they can <unk> and thus gain a little ground day by day , and as soon as they win some high point , like say <unk> hill , it <name> be all up with general <unk> , <name> my words . "
the night to follow proved to be <name> , and so cold that the majority of the sailors were glad to <name> their heavy <unk> .
fearing that the enemy would try to take advantage of the weather , admiral togo turned on all the <unk> his fleet possessed , and these were flashed in all directions .
" false alarm , " said <name> , after midnight had sounded out on the ship's <name> .
" reckon the russians do n't dare to come out . "
but the old yankee tar was mistaken .
the enemy were on the alert , and at three o'clock , when the mist was extra heavy , the movement to steal out of port <name> harbor was begun , two torpedo destroyers taking the lead , and several cruisers following .
this brought on a heavy <unk> lasting far into the next day , and one which came close to cost <name> his life .
chapter xxvi <name> meets captain barusky for several days poor <name> remained a prisoner aboard of the small steamer .
during that time only two men came near him  an under officer and the sailor who supplied him with food and water .
neither would answer his questions , so he could not learn where he was being taken or what was to be done with him .
one evening there was a slight commotion on the deck , and the course of the steamer was changed .
then came a blowing of steam whistles lasting several minutes .
finally the steamer came to a standstill .
" you are to leave this vessel at once , " said the under officer , as he opened the door of the young captain 's temporary prison .
" come , we have no time to spare . "
" where am i to go ? "
questioned <name> .
" you <name> soon learn .
hurry ! "
there was no help for it , and soon <name> was on deck .
he was made to enter a small boat and was thus transferred to another steamer  one which had formerly been in the east indian trade but which was now acting as a russian supply boat .
" what a dirty craft ! "
was his mental comment , after having been thrust into a pen which was little better than a horse stall .
the supply boat was loaded to its fullest capacity , so quarters for all on board were limited .
two days passed and he received food which was scarcely fit to eat .
when he protested he was threatened with a flogging .
the air was foul and he began to fear that he would become sick .
" i wo n't be able to stand this much longer , " he thought , dismally .
" if they want to kill me why do n't they do it at once and have done with it ? "
on the following morning a surprise awaited him .
he heard two russian officers pause in front of his pen and one said to the other : " here is the prisoner , captain barusky . "
" is it the fellow named <name> ? "
was the question from captain barusky , the rascal who had aided <name> snokoff to make so much trouble for <name> pennington .
" the same . "
" they did not capture his friend ? "
" no  in the struggle he slipped away . "
" i am sorry for that .
we wanted pennington more than we did this fellow .
but i am glad we got at least one of them .
as i understand it they work <unk> with each other ; " and then the two russian officers passed on .
like a flash <name> realized the truth of the situation .
his taking off had been a trap set by snokoff and this captain barusky , who had hired the chunchuses to help work out their plot .
he was now in the hands of the enemy in more ways than one .
" they wo n't treat me as an ordinary prisoner , " he reasoned .
" this captain barusky <name> make it as hard as possible for me  more especially so as <name> managed to escape his clutches .
well , i am glad <name> got away . "
resolved to " take the bull by the horns , " <name> asked the prison guard if he might speak to captain barusky .
" i <name> see about it , " answered the sailor , and went off to find out .
on his return he stated that the captain would visit the pen some time during the day .
the russian officer came late in the afternoon , when nobody else was near the pen .
there was a sarcastic look on his face when he gazed at the young captain .
" so you want to talk to me , " he said , abruptly .
" i do , captain barusky .
i want to know why this plot was laid against me . "
" i know of no plot .
you are an american in the employ of the japanese government as a spy .
russia captures all the japanese spies she can . "
" i am no spy . "
the russian shrugged his shoulders .
" that is what your friend , captain pennington , once told me , too .
yet as soon as he got out of port <name> he was made a captain in the mikado 's army . "
" he applied for the position because the russians had <unk> him and because he loves active service . "
" have it as you please , <name> ; both of you are spies , and you <name> have to suffer as one . "
" where are you taking me ? "
" since you seem so anxious to know , i <name> tell you , for i do not think you <name> be able to take the news to the japanese .
this boat is carrying supplies to port <name> . "
" port <name> ! "
" that is what i said .
when we arrive there you <name> be placed in one of the strongest of our prisons at the port .
do you not admire the prospect ? "
" well , if you take me to port <name> , perhaps i <name> n't be a prisoner long , " replied <name> , resolved to put on as bold a front as possible .
" and why not ? "
demanded captain barusky , curiously .
" because our army and our navy are bound to capture the place . "
" bah !
the japanese <name> never take port <name> .
it is absurd to think of it . "
" it may not come right away  but it <name> come sooner or later . "
" never !
but if it should , you <name> not be there to enjoy our downfall .
remember that spies are tried , and if found guilty they are taken out and shot . "
" you can not prove that i am a spy . "
" that remains to be seen . "
" if you bring me before the court i 'll have something to say about your underhanded work with <name> snokoff .
i can prove that he is a swindler and that you are his accomplice . "
" <name> !
you threaten me ! "
roared captain barusky , in a rage .
" have a care !
i come from a most respectable family and i have great influence . "
" nevertheless , i think those who are higher in authority than yourself <name> listen to my story .
the russian army officers are as a rule gentlemen and strictly honest . "
" which means to say that i am not a gentleman and not honest ! "
bellowed captain barusky .
" that , for your opinion ! "
and reaching out he gave <name> a ringing box on the ear .
it was the last straw .
with no fresh air and no food fit to eat , the young captain was desperate , and leaping forward he struck at the russian captain 's nose .
his fist went true , and as barusky staggered back against the pen door the blood <unk> from his nasal organ .
" do n't you dare to hit me again ! "
panted <name> , standing before the russian with both hands clenched .
" do n't you dare  or you 'll get the worst of it ! "
his manner made captain barusky <unk> back , and he glared at <name> with the ferocity of a wild beast .
then he called to the guard .
" run for aid , <unk> , " he said .
" the prisoner has attacked me .
he is a beast , and must be chained up . "
the man addressed summoned three other sailors and the captain of the ship 's guard .
all came into the pen and forced <name> into a corner .
" the yankee dog ! "
said the captain of the guard .
" to dare to strike a russian officer !
bring the chains at once ! "
chains were brought , and soon <name> was bound hands and feet , with links that weighed several pounds .
then a large staple was driven into one of the <unk> of the pen and he was fastened to this with a <unk> .
" now place him on <unk> , " said captain barusky .
" it is the only way to tame him . "
and then he hurried away to bathe his nose , which was swelling rapidly .
if <name> had been miserable before he was doubly so now .
the chains were <unk> and cut into his flesh , and being fastened to the upright he could scarcely move a foot either way .
to add to his misery the front of the pen was boarded over , so that what little light had been admitted to his prison was cut off .
in this wretched condition he passed a full week .
in that time captain barusky came to peep in at him three times , and on each occasion tried to say something to make him still more <unk> .
the food was so bad he could not eat and the air often made his head ache as if it would crack open .
" if this is a sample of russian prison life it 's a wonder all the prisoners do n't go mad , " he reasoned .
" a few months of this would surely kill me . "
at the end of the week <name> heard firing at a distance .
the supply boat was now trying to steal into port <name> and had been discovered by a japanese patrol boat .
the craft was struck twice and the prisoner below heard a wild commotion on the deck , as one of the funnels was carried away .
but darkness favored the russians , and inside of two hours the supply boat passed into port <name> harbor without sustaining further damage .
she was then directed to a proper anchorage by the harbor master ; and on the following day the transfer of her cargo to the <unk> on shore was begun .
for several days longer <name> was kept on the boat .
then , one wet and cold morning , he was liberated and told to march on deck .
from the vessel he was taken to a big stone building which was being used as one of the garrison quarters .
here he was given a scant hearing in the presence of captain barusky , who appeared against him .
" we have no time to investigate your case at present , captain <name> , " said the officer who conducted the examination .
" but from reports i should surmise that you are a dangerous young man .
you must remain a prisoner . "
and then the young captain was taken away .
later on , he was marched a distance of half a mile and blindfolded .
when the bandage was removed from his eyes , he found himself in an old stone building , dirty and neglected .
he was taken to a small room , having a grated window , and thrust inside .
six other prisoners were put into the apartment with him , one man with a hacking cough , dreadful to hear .
the door was closed and barred ; and all were left to take care of themselves as best they could .
chapter xxvii a fierce battle at sea <name> was taking a nap when the call came to clear the ship for action .
it had been discovered that the russian fleet was trying to escape from port <name> harbor , and the news was flashed from vessel to vessel of admiral togo 's fleet , and all were ordered to prevent the movement at any cost .
" now i reckon we are in fer it ! "
ejaculated <name> , as he and the youth rushed over to their gun .
" <name> , it 's in my mind we have some tall work cut out fer us this trip ! "
" let it come  i am in just the humor for fighting ! "
cried <name> .
" i <name> we can smash them just as we smashed the spanish ships in manila bay . "
sailors and gunners were hurrying in all directions , and orders were coming in rapid succession .
at first the russian ships had turned in one direction , now they were turning in another , and , later still , they separated .
a distant firing could already be heard , but where it came from those on the shohirika could not tell .
so far no ships of the enemy could be seen with the naked eye .
the <unk> kept a close watch , and the <unk> continued to play all over the bosom of the rolling sea .
it was almost daylight when a distant explosion was heard .
a russian torpedo boat had run into a mine and was so badly damaged that she sank inside of ten minutes , carrying a large part of her crew with her .
this disaster proved a warning to the other russian ships and they proceeded on their courses with added caution .
the japanese warships were equally on the alert , yet , just as the sun came up , one brushed against a mine and received such damage that she was practically put out of the contest .
" there is one of the enemy 's ships ! "
was the cry , as the mist swept away as if by magic and the sun came out strongly .
" now is our chance .
<unk> !  " " and there is another ship ! "
came a moment later , " and one of our own pounding her as if she was a witch ! "
guns were now booming over the water constantly , and from the forts on shore came shots and shells in rapid succession .
soon the shohirika was in the midst of the battle , and then <name> and <name> worked over the gun as never before , doing their full share towards <unk> the ship that was trying to escape up the <unk> coast .
for over an hour the running fire kept up .
neither ship dared to put on full speed , for fear of running into a mine .
solid shot was hurled in all directions , and the shohirika received one below the water line which for the moment looked as if it might sink the craft .
but the ship 's carpenter and his crew got at the leak immediately , driving in a wedge which quickly stopped the flow of water .
it was hard , exhausting work between decks , and at the end of an hour <name> felt he must have some fresh air .
both he and <name> applied for permission to go on deck , and this permission was readily granted , for the guns on their side of the warship were not then in use .
on the deck of the shohirika they could see what this battle really meant .
dirt and debris were to be seen in many places , and half a dozen sailors and marines had been killed or wounded .
everybody was bathed in perspiration and <unk> , and some of those who worked the big guns were panting like dogs after a <name> .
" it 's work , that 's what it is , " said <name> , running the perspiration from his <unk> forehead with his finger .
" ai n't no child 's play about it ! "
" and dangerous work at that , " added <name> .
he gave a look toward the enemy 's ships .
" i declare , <name> , i believe they are running back to port <name> harbor ! "
" i think the same , lad , " responded the yankee gunner .
" reckon they are <unk> ' it is goin ' to cost too much to get away .
as soon as they get away from them land batteries we can pound 'em for keeps and they know it . "
" and get away from the mines .
that 's the worst with fighting around here  you do n't know how soon you 'll hit a mine and be blown up . "
" oh , i reckon our captain is watching out fer them pesky things . "
<name> was interested in watching the sharpshooters and <unk> in the tops , and he walked across the deck to get a better look at them .
<name> followed , and as he did so , one of the nearest of the russian ships sent out a roaring broadside at the shohirika which raked her fore and aft and sent another hole through her side , but this time above the water line where it did scant damage .
" gee <name> ! "
began <name> , when he chanced to glance upward .
" <name> , look out ! "
he screamed .
" the top 's coming down on ye ! "
<name> was right .
one of the shots from the enemy had struck the foremast , above the fighting top , and it was crashing down , carrying a portion of the ship 's flag with it .
one end struck the gun turret , and then the wreckage hit <name> on the shoulder , hurling him on his back .
the foremast was heavy and had it struck the youth before landing on the turret and the surrounding works it might have killed the young <unk> mate on the spot .
as it was , <name> lay like a log where he had fallen and when <name> raised him up the old tar found him unconscious .
" if he ai n't got his shoulder broke then i miss my guess , " muttered the yankee gunner .
" <name> !
<name> !
ca n't ye speak to me ? "
" that was a nasty one , " came from one of the officers of the deck .
" better <name> him below . "
and then the officer gave orders to remove the wreckage and hoist the flag once more .
with the unconscious youth in his arms , <name> hurried below and to the sick bay of the warship .
here the surgeon got to work immediately and examined <name> thoroughly .
" no bones broken , " he announced .
" but the bruise is severe and he is suffering from shock .
he <name> soon come to his senses . "
<name> had to return to his gun , for duty is duty in the navy , regardless of what is happening around one .
it was true , the russian warships were now doing their best to sneak back into port <name> harbor and admiral togo wanted to do all the damage possible before the forts made it impossible to follow them further .
all of the warships ' guns were worked to their utmost , and when the russian vessels did get back they were so badly crippled that they were of small consequence for future fighting until undergoing repairs .
when <name> opened his eyes again he found himself lying on a clean white cot in the ship 's hospital with an attendant standing over him bathing his face .
" oh ! "
he murmured and stared around him .
" oh , my shoulder !
that was a fearful crack i got ! "
the attendant did not understand , but smiled blandly and continued to bathe his face and also his head .
soon the full realization of what had happened came to the young gunner 's mate .
then he asked about <name> .
the fighting was at an end and presently <name> came to him , to find <name> sitting up in a chair .
" i feel stiff and sore all over , <name> , " said the youth .
" it was just as if a house came down on me . "
" thank fortune you was n't killed , or did n't have your bones broken , " returned the yankee gunner .
" i am thankful .
were you hurt ? "
" not in the least . "
" what about the fight ? "
" the russians have sneaked back into the harbor like a lot of whipped dogs . "
" what is our ship doing ? "
" putting up the coast .
i do n't know where we are going , " answered <name> .
<name> remained in the ship 's hospital for three days and then resumed his duties as before .
his shoulder still felt stiff and sore and lifting anything was a good deal of labor .
but <name> favored him , so he got along very well .
a week passed and the shohirika remained at sea , moving in a wide circle , on the lookout for russian warships or supply boats .
but none were encountered , and then the cruiser was ordered to escort a transport filled with soldiers bound for the front .
the transport landed at a point some miles north of <unk> and the troops went ashore without delay .
they were bound for the railroad , and were to participate in the advance upon port <name> from that point .
as the warship remained in the harbor several days , both <name> and <name> were allowed a short run on shore .
they enjoyed this trip very much , until , much to their surprise , they learned that <name> okopa 's command was in the vicinity .
then they hunted this up , to learn the sad news from <name> that <name> was missing .
" missing ! "
ejaculated <name> , in horror .
" taken by chunchuses !
oh , <name> , this is dreadful ! "
" well , i do n't know as you feel any worse than i do , <name> , " answered <name> .
" it makes me wild to think of it . "
" but could n't you find any trace of him at all ? "
" not the slightest , although i think he was carried off in a boat . "
" but why should the chinese brigands make him a prisoner ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know , excepting to hold him for a ransom .
but if they intended to do that it is likely we should have heard from them before this . "
the matter was discussed as long as <name> and <name> could remain on shore .
but nothing came of it , and with a heavy heart the young <unk> mate returned to his place on the warship .
chapter xxviii the siege of port <name> after the fruitless effort to escape from port <name> harbor the russian warships " bottled up " there remained where they were for a long time to come .
occasionally one or another attempted to run the blockade , but results were usually disastrous , and at last the risk became so great nothing more was done in that direction .
the japanese continued to put down mines and sank several boats loaded with stone in or near the winding channel , and this made getting in as hard as getting out  thus putting a stop to the arrival of more supply boats , such as brought <name> to the seaport .
in the meantime the campaign on land was pushed forward with increased activity .
the headquarters of the japanese army investing port <name> was not far from the railroad , but the lines stretched many miles to the east and the west .
troops were hurried both from japan and from the divisions near <unk> , and heavy siege guns were mounted on every available hilltop .
the japanese were , at the start , at a great disadvantage  they could not see the enemy at which they were firing .
hills and mountains cut them off from every view of the port .
but they kept hammering away , day after day , week after week , and month after month , gaining steadily , throwing up new intrenchments , digging new tunnels , and hauling their heavy guns forward to more advantageous positions .
the labor was body racking and the sacrifice of life enormous .
but the mikado 's soldiers did not appear to care .
they had set out to capture port <name> and they were going to do it .
for the <unk> and for the cavalry there was at the start but little to do in the way of fighting .
most of the time was spent in digging trenches and tunnels , and in keeping out of the way of shells that whistled and screamed in all directions  shells weighing hundreds of pounds , which , when they struck , tore up the ground for yards around and smashed the rocks as if the latter were passing through a quartz <unk> .
such is war of modern times , when carried on at a distance of miles .
but as the months went by , and japanese and russians came closer to each other , hand-to-hand conflicts became numerous .
the russians <unk> every foot of the ground , fighting with a courage that was truly heroic , and sacrificing themselves freely for the czar and the country they loved .
the hand-to-hand conflicts became bloody in the extreme , thousands upon thousands being slaughtered between the rising and the setting of the sun .
from the seacoast the command to which <name> was attached moved to a small place called <unk> <unk> .
here they went into camp for several weeks and while there were joined by a number of other commands , including that containing those old soldiers of fortune , <name> <name> and <name> stummer , who had served with <name> and <name> in cuba and in the philippines .
" py <unk> , of it to n't done mine heart goot to see you , <unk> ! "
exclaimed <name> stummer , rushing up and giving <name> a handshake .
" how you peen , <unk> ? "
" first rate , stummer .
and how are you , <name> ? "
" sure an ' it 's meself is as <unk> as a fiddle , " answered the irishman , with a broad grin on his freckled face .
" it 's a great war , ai n't it now ?
both <unk> is fightin ' like a pair o ' <unk> cats , so they are !
an' where is me ould friend , captain <name> ? "
" he was captured by chunchuses . "
" no ! "
came from both stummer and <name> , and then they poured in a volley of questions which were bewildering .
<name> answered them as best he could .
" <name> 's der <unk> ding vot i hear yet alretty ! "
said <name> stummer , with a sad shake of his head .
" i <unk> i got dem <unk>  or vot you call dem  here .
i fix 'em , eh , tan ? "
<name> <name> nodded vigorously .
" sure an ' we 'd be after puttin ' a ball through <unk> mother 's son of 'em , so we would !
poor <name> <name> !
i <unk> him <unk> a brother ! "
and the honest <name> <unk> heaved a long sigh .
both <name> and stummer had been having easy times of it for several weeks , but now they were called upon to go forth with pick and shovel , to do their share of work in digging intrenchments .
this was not so nice , but they went at the labor without a murmur .
" sure an ' we might as well git into practice , " observed <name> , as he started in with vigor .
" whin the war 's over an ' we git back to the states , it may be ourselves as <name> be workin ' fer the corporation in new york or <unk> ! "
" yah , udder puttin ' town railroad <unk> alretty in der vest , " answered <name> stummer .
" <name> is , " he added , " of i to n't got money enough to <unk> a farm . "
" 't is a stock farm i 'm <unk> ' , " came from <name> .
" wid horses <unk> .
there 's money for ye , <name> ! "
and he went to work with added vigor  as if he expected to turn up the stock farm from the soil beneath him .
to <name> , even though he occasionally saw stummer and <name> , the days were very lonely .
he missed <name> greatly , and each day wondered if he would ever see his old war chum again .
<name> okopa saw this and did what he could to cheer up the young officer .
" he may turn up before you realize it , " said the <name> .
" i do n't think he was killed . "
" if he is alive , it is very strange that we do not hear from him . "
two days later came a batch of letters into camp , written , or rather painted , for the most part , on thin japanese paper .
among the communications were two for <name> , one from captain ponsberry concerning the columbia and her cargo , and the other from a stranger in pekin , <name> .
" who can be writing to me from pekin , <name> ? "
mused the young captain , and began to read the communication with interest .
it was from a chinese merchant , and ran in part as follows : " you <name> be mystified to receive this from an utter stranger , but i deem it my duty , kind sir , to send this word to you .
" know , then , that one <name> gow , a servant of my family , was in port <name> up to sixteen days ago  first a servant in an american family there , and next a prisoner in the <unk> prison man ever saw , guarded by dogs of russians unworthy to be used as door mats .
<name> gow is a faithful man , the flower of all my help .
" it is needless to explain to you why my servant was thus <unk> .
but you must know that when in prison he met your great friend captain <name> <name> , and it was the captain who saved <name> gow from many hard blows from the other prisoners , who wanted not a chinaman amongst them .
" <name> gow was grateful , even as i am grateful , and he promised to get word to you of this matter if the russians granted him his <name> .
finding no fault in my servant he was , after a time , liberated , and watching his chance , left port <name> and came home .
" kind sir , he is grateful to captain <name> and would do much for him if he could .
yet his most is to send this letter to you , telling you that captain <name> is alive and held in a port <name> prison as a spy .
one russian hates him  his name , captain barusky ,  and it would appear that this russian is also your enemy , so beware of him .
" i can tell no more .
<name> gow is sick from his treatment at the hands of the russian dogs .
accept this miserable assurance of my eternal friendship , and esteem for one i know must be high and illustrious . "
" <unk> mo . "
<name> read the letter several times and showed it to <name> okopa .
it was written in true chinese style , with a big chinese seal attached , and was , beyond all doubt , genuine .
" i ca n't understand one thing , " said the young captain .
" how did <name> get to port <name> ? "
" it may be that this captain barusky had him taken there , captain pennington . "
" i thought captain barusky was at <unk> . "
" the russians have been taking in some troops at port <name> on the sly .
despite admiral togo 's efforts , some supply boats and transports have passed his ships . "
" if barusky is there he <name> do what he can to make <name> miserable .
he is down on both of us  for he knows we are down on him and <name> snokoff . "
" do you think snokoff could have anything to do with this ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know .
anything is possible .
snokoff would be glad to make trouble for <name>  since he helped me to make him settle up at <unk> .
those chunchuses tried to capture both of us . "
the matter was talked over for half an hour , but brought forth no satisfaction .
to <name> 's mind , being held by the russians as a spy was as bad as being in the hands of the chinese brigands .
" i wish we could get into port <name> at once , " he said , finally .
" i should n't like anything better than to capture this captain barusky and liberate <name> . "
" we are bound to get into the port sooner or later , " answered <name> okopa .
" they are bringing up more siege guns every day .
if the russians wo n't give up we 'll batter the whole town down over their heads . "
" which <name> be a bad thing for <name> , " rejoined <name> .
" i do n't want him killed in the attempt to rescue him . "
chapter xxix from one difficulty to another " where is this going to end ? "
it was <name> who asked himself the question , as he walked up and down the narrow cell in which he had been confined in the prison at port <name> .
what had been written to <name> in the letter from pekin had been substantially correct .
<name> had aided <name> gow in numerous ways , and for this the chinaman had been extremely grateful and had promised to do all he could for the young captain should he manage to escape from the <unk> seaport .
then <name> gow had disappeared one night , and that was the last <name> saw of him .
three days later a guard entered the prison and announced that the prisoners were to be transferred to other quarters .
with his hands bound behind him , <name> was marched forth through a side street of port <name> , where stood an old building which had formerly been used as a market .
cells had been built in this structure , and into one of these he was thrust , the guard sarcastically telling him to make himself as comfortable as possible .
the young captain was sick in both body and mind and fast reaching that point where one becomes desperate and fit for any deed of daring .
more than once he was tempted to throw himself on the guard in an endeavor to <unk> the fellow and escape .
but he realized that if caught at this he would be immediately shot down .
day after day passed , and from outside the prisoner heard the dull booming of cannon .
occasionally a shell would explode close to the prison , causing a wild yell of alarm and a general rush by those outside .
there were flags over the prisons and over the hospitals , showing what manner of places they were , but , as said before , the japanese were at a loss to see what they were firing at , so many shots and shells went where they were not intended .
these <unk> were what caused the report to circulate that the mikado 's men were not fighting according to the rules of modern warfare , but were doing their best to <unk> the hospitals in which lay their own and the russian wounded .
it was a cold , raw day , with a touch of snow in the air , and <name> felt one of his desperate moods coming over him .
his hands and feet were free and he peered forth from the one narrow window that the cell contained .
all he could see beyond was a courtyard , surrounded by a stone wall .
" i wish i was out there  i 'd get over that wall somehow ! "
he muttered to himself .
the cell window was not over fifteen or sixteen inches wide and twice that in height .
the bars were of iron , but set in wooden frames but a few inches in thickness .
" a fellow might smash out those bars with the bench end , " he thought .
" but after that what ?
i reckon the guard in the courtyard would shoot me on sight .
i might try it at night . "
still in a desperate mood , <name> picked up the bench , a solid affair several feet long .
he made an imaginary lunge at the window bars with it .
" i 'll wager i could knock them out with one blow .
they   " <name> got no further , for at the moment a fearful explosion sounded somewhere overhead .
the explosion was followed by a crash and a wild yell of alarm .
a japanese shell had struck the top of the building , tearing away fully a quarter of the roof and sending the bricks and timbers flying in all directions .
" now is my chance ! "
he muttered , and without stopping to think twice he rammed the window bars as hard as he could with the bench .
a second and third blow followed , and down went the irons , carrying a portion of the window frame with them .
then through the opening leaped the young captain .
as he landed in the courtyard , he picked up a small log of wood lying handy .
a glance around told him that the guard was nowhere in sight , the russian having run to the other side of the building to note the damage done by the shell .
log in hand , <name> leaped quickly across the courtyard and placed the bit of wood up against the wall .
this gave him a footing , and in a twinkling he was on top of the wall .
but though he acted quickly a guard from the prison building saw him and ran forth gun in hand .
" halt ! "
came the command , in russian , and then , raising his weapon , the guard fired at <name> .
the bullet whistled over the young captain 's head , and without looking back to see who had fired it , he dropped on the other side of the wall .
then he <unk> up the street and around a corner .
<name> knew not where to go , but his one thought was to put distance between himself and the prison , and he hurried on and on , until he came to a barn which stood open .
into this he darted , to find the building empty of occupants .
the japanese had begun a general bombardment of port <name> and shot and shells were flying in all directions .
this being the case , the majority of the troops and the inhabitants were out of sight ,  hid away in cellars and <unk> .
nobody paid any attention to him and he was thus given ample time in which to think matters over and decide upon his next movement .
from the barn <name> moved to the building next door  which was a sort of dwelling and storehouse combined .
here , from the wide open doorway , he gazed at the scene of destruction before him .
it was full of horror and made him shiver .
" war is certainly a terrible thing , " he thought .
he saw some people running for their lives , and beheld one man go down struck in the back by a shell .
then he turned away to shut out the sight .
in one room of the warehouse he found an old overcoat and a slouch hat , and lost no time in donning these , both as a disguise and to keep himself warm .
then he hunted around for something to eat , but could not find a mouthful .
" i might have known there would be no food <unk> , " he told himself .
" did n't they say at the prison that they were slaughtering the horses just for the meat , and that butter and eggs were worth their weight in gold ?
i 'll be lucky to get bread and soup  especially as i have n't a dollar with which to pay for a meal . "
<name> was about to leave the warehouse when he saw a file of russian soldiers approaching .
with the soldiers were two officers , and as they came closer he recognized one as captain barusky .
" it was a bad thing to let that american escape , " said the captain to the other officer .
" if you catch sight of him , shoot him on the spot . "
" which we shall do with pleasure , " was the ready answer ; and then officers and soldiers passed on .
" i 've got to keep out of sight , that 's all there is to that , " reasoned <name> , grimly .
" if they catch me again it 's all up with me .
i wonder if it would be possible to get out of port <name> ?
<name> got out , but things were n't half so closely guarded as they are now . "
<name> waited until nightfall before leaving the warehouse .
then , keeping a constant lookout for russian soldiers , he sneaked along one street after another .
where to go he did not know , but he realized that he must have something to eat or he would starve .
presently he came to a small garden in the center of which was a <unk> residence .
on the <unk> was the name <name> <name> .
" <name> <name> ! "
<name> cried , half aloud .
" i wonder if that can be the gentleman <name> knew ?
if it is perhaps he <name> aid me . "
at first the young captain thought to ring the <unk> , but fearful of meeting the wrong person he resolved to investigate in a more private manner .
the side windows of the residence were curtained , but the curtains were only partly down .
going to one of the windows he peered inside .
in a neatly furnished sitting room sat a young <name> and a russian soldier .
they were arguing about something  money matters as far as <name> could make out .
the young <name> did not wish to give the soldier the money and he insisted upon having it .
while <name> gazed at the scene , the russian soldier leaped up , grasped the young <name> by the shoulders and shook her roughly .
" do n't ! "
screamed the young <name> , in english .
" let me go ! "
" i want the money ! "
answered the soldier , in his native tongue .
he was a cossack and of brutal features .
the young <name> was pretty and she was helpless , and this combination was more than the young captain could resist .
regardless of consequences , he shoved up the window and leaped inside the apartment .
" keep your hands off of that young <name> ! "
he cried , and catching the cossack by the shoulder he threw him backward .
" do n't you know how to treat a <name> when you meet her , you big brute ? "
the cossack was startled , first because he had not expected the interruption and secondly because he had no business to be in the mansion .
he gave one look at <name> and then rushed out into the hallway and left the premises with all possible speed .
as soon as the cossack was gone the young <name> and <name> stared at each other .
she started to speak , but stopped suddenly .
" excuse me for coming in as i did , but i thought it was necessary , " said the young captain .
" i guess that fellow had no business here . "
" you are right , sir .
papa is away , and he wanted me to give him money .
he must have known i was alone in the house . "
" are you miss <name> ? "
" i am .
but you have the advantage of me . "
" i know it .
i am captain <name> <name> .
perhaps you know an old friend of mine , <name> pennington .
he knows your father , i believe . "
" oh , yes , i have met captain pennington .
they tell me he is now in the japanese army . "
" he is . "
<name> paused and looked at the young <name> keenly .
" miss <name> , can i trust you ? "
he asked , abruptly .
" what do you mean ? "
" i <name> tell you , " and in a few brief words he related his story , to which <name> <name> listened with close attention .
" you were lucky to escape from that prison ! "
she cried , when he had finished .
" to be sure i <name> assist you as far as i can .
papa is away on business , but i expect him back in two or three hours .
we have n't much on hand to eat , but such as there is you are welcome to . "
" i 'm hungry enough to eat anything , " said <name> , with a little smile .
" then come with me to the dining room , captain <name> , and i <name> prepare supper . "
" you have n't any servants now , i suppose ? "
" no ; every one of them has deserted us . "
they entered the dining room , and the young <name> asked <name> to close the shutters .
while he was doing this she prepared such a meal as the larder of the house afforded .
it was not much , but he did not complain , and he thanked her warmly for giving what he felt she could ill afford to set before him .
the meal finished , they sat down to await the coming of mr. <name> .
while doing this <name> related some of his experiences in the army and the young <name> told of the horrors of the siege .
" one can not understand it unless you are in the midst of it , " she said .
" papa says business is at a standstill , the hospitals are filled with the sick and the wounded , and we are in constant dread that the next moment <name> be our last .
the suspense is so great that in one or two cases the inhabitants have gone crazy . "
" i can well believe that , miss <name> .
during the war in the philippines i saw   " <name> paused , as a heavy footstep sounded on the porch of the residence .
other footsteps followed , and then came a loud knock on the door .
" open here ! "
demanded a voice in russian .
" open , in the name of the czar ! "
chapter xxx a surprise for <name> as the days passed , the watch upon port <name> from the sea became closer and closer .
admiral togo gave strict orders that no ships should be allowed to enter or come from the harbor under any circumstances , and each commander of a warship was on his mettle , knowing full well that if he was derelict in his duty he would speedily hear from his superior in a manner far from pleasant .
<unk> became something of a monotony to <name> and <name> , and after several weeks had passed both wished something would happen .
" i 'd rather put up with a stiff sea fight than this , " declared the young gunner 's mate .
" right ye are , lad , " replied the old yankee tar .
" ai n't no use o ' bein' ready for a <unk> if it ai n't comin ' .
as it now is , life in the navy ai n't no more <unk> ' nor life on the old columbia . "
during that time <name> received a letter from captain ponsberry , similar in contents to that sent to <name> .
the japanese government had released the cargo of the schooner and then bought the same at a good round price .
the ship had also been released , captain ponsberry having to pay a nominal sum for this action .
" i think the captain is lucky to get off so easily , " said <name> .
" i suppose the japanese government might have scooped in everything . "
" well , the japs think it best to remain friendly to the united states , " answered <name> , and it is likely that the old sailor was more than half right .
cold weather had come in <name> and work on deck was far from pleasant .
yet each man on the shohirika had to do his full duty as before , and , be it said to their credit , not a sailor or <name> did any shirking .
gun drills and various exercises were kept up constantly .
one day the warship ran close to a big trading brig bound for hong-kong .
as was the custom , the brig stopped to allow the commander of the shohirika to make certain that she was not carrying <unk> of war for russia or had no intentions of running the blockade .
while this examination was going on , <name> and <name> chanced to come on deck , curious to have a look at the stranger .
" about as big a brig as i ever see in these parts , " was the yankee <unk> comment .
" she must <name> a <unk> cargo . "
" yes , and a lot of men to man her , " answered <name> .
" think of hoisting and <unk> such sails as she carries ! "
the two vessels had come fairly close to each other , and our friends continued to survey the brig with interest .
then <name> gave a cry .
" oh , <name> , i wish i had a glass ! "
" why ? "
" unless i am mistaken , there is shamhaven on the deck of that ship ! "
" no ! "
<name> pointed with his hand .
" does n't that look like him ? "
he continued .
" <unk> me , if i do n't think you 're right , lad .
wait , i 'll get a glass an ' make certain ! "
the old tar knew where he could borrow a glass , and in a minute more he returned , and both took a brief look through the instrument .
" it is shamhaven ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" and look , there is peterson coming from the <unk> ! "
" that 's so .
what ye goin ' to do about it ? "
" tell the officer of the deck .
they <name> n't get off with my money if i can help it . "
rushing away , <name> soon acquainted the proper officer with what he had discovered  telling as much about the robbery as seemed necessary .
the officer was interested , and , what was even more to the point , liked the young american .
" do you wish to go to yonder ship and confront the men ? "
he asked .
" try me and see ! "
answered <name> , excitedly .
" i mean , yes , sir , " he stammered .
" and <name> you let <name> striker go , too ? "
the officer agreed , and soon another small boat put off from the warship , and <name> and <name> , with the officer , were speedily landed on the deck of the brig .
" you 're a fine rascal , to <name> me ! "
cried <name> , rushing up to shamhaven .
" and to <name> captain ponsberry , too ! "
shamhaven had not expected this encounter , and for the moment he was <unk> .
he gazed from <name> to <name> as if they were ghosts .
" i  i  who are you , anyway ? "
he stammered .
" i do n't know you , " he added , striving to regain his composure .
" yes , you do know me , and you know <name> striker , too , " answered the young gunner 's mate .
" what does this mean ? "
asked the captain of the brig , while a number of others looked on with interest .
" i 'll tell you what it means , sir , " said <name> , and did so .
" he has got to give up my money belt and my money , and give up captain <unk> money , too . "
at this moment peterson came up and was promptly collared by <name> .
" stop !
do n't you vos touch me ! "
cried peterson .
" i ai n't noddings done , no . "
" you helped shamhaven to <name> me , " came from <name> .
" no , he done it all alone !
i no touch noddings ! "
" oh , shut up ! "
roared shamhaven , in disgust .
" i never robbed anybody .
if you lost your money peterson must have taken it . "
a quarrel ensued between the evildoers , in the midst of which came a cry from the shohirika .
" an enemy is in sight ! "
at once all attention was turned to the warship .
scarcely a minute elapsed when a signal was displayed : " a battleship , and she is trying to escape up the coast ! "
" to the boats ! "
roared the japanese officer on the deck of the brig .
" to the boats at once !
this investigation <name> have to be postponed .
we shall expect you to remain as you are "  the latter words to the captain of the big brig .
" as you <name> , " was the smooth answer .
a rush was made for the two small boats , <name> and <name> being hustled along with the crowd .
soon they put off for the warship , which was already preparing to follow the russian battleship that had been seen .
" i did n't get my money , after all , " grumbled the youth .
" but perhaps i 'll get it later  if that ship of the enemy does n't sink us , " he added .
as soon as they were on board of the shohirika again , the cruiser started after the battleship .
but the enemy had a good lead , and it was some time before the japanese warship could command a full head of steam , which meant everything to her .
then , when steam was to be had in plenty , there came a breakdown in the engine room , causing a delay of twenty minutes .
" we 'll never catch her ,  at least , not to-day , " said <name> , and he was right .
darkness found the battleship still three miles away .
half a dozen shots were fired at her , but none took effect .
then night ended the pursuit .
in the morning nothing was to be seen of the enemy and those on the japanese warship were much depressed , for they had fancied that an encounter might add greatly to their laurels .
but shortly before noon the lookout announced the approach of another ship .
" a russian cruiser ! "
was the cry .
this was correct  the vessel was the auxiliary cruiser , <unk> , formerly a steamer in the siberian trade .
she was manned by a fierce and <unk> body of sailors and marines , and carried a first and second battery of no mean proportions .
" i 'll wager we have got some work cut out for us now , " said <name> , and he was right .
finding she could not run away from the shohirika the russian auxiliary cruiser came steaming up and let drive at close range ,  a broadside that raked the japanese warship from end to end with deadly effect .
the shohirika answered immediately , and both the steering wheel and the rudder were smashed on the enemy 's ship .
" phew !
but this is hot work ! "
panted <name> , as all those around the gun worked like trojans .
" an ' it 's going to be hotter ! "
ejaculated <name> .
he sighted the piece with care .
" there , <name> <name> , let her go ! "
and he pressed the electric button .
bang !  went the gun with a roar that was deafening .
then the breech was thrown open and the smoke rolled out , filling the air with a smell that made them cough and sneeze .
but nobody stopped work .
in a trice the gun was cleaned and cooled and another shell pushed into place , and then the firing was repeated .
" she 's coming alongside ! "
was the announcement from on deck .
" all hands to repel boarders ! "
" a hand-to-hand fight ! "
cried <name> , and scarcely had the words been uttered when there came a bump that hurled half the sailors flat .
up they sprang , and as order after order was delivered the marines and others ran for their guns and cutlasses , while the officers saw to it that their pistols were ready for use .
a wild , maddening yell came from the deck of the russian ship , as marines and sailors poured over the side .
an answering <unk> issued from the japanese , and they met the first onslaught with vigor .
then came a fierce tramping over the deck , as the two conflicting parties moved first to one side and then the other .
" we are ordered up ! "
cried <name> , a few minutes later .
" here is where we have got to fight for it , <name> ! "
" right you are , lad .
do your best , and trust to heaven for the rest ! "
was the yankee tar 's reply .
and then , cutlasses in hand , both mounted to the deck , to engage in the <unk> hand-to-hand encounter either of them had ever experienced .
chapter xxxi a call to repel boarders it was a battle <name> from the start and for some time neither side had an advantage .
pistol shot was met by pistol shot , and a rifle gun placed on the upper deck of the russian warship was balanced in execution by a similar gun mounted on the shohirika .
the slaughter created by both weapons was frightful , a dozen or more going down on either side each time a gun was discharged .
when <name> and <name> came out on desk the spectacle was enough to make the blood of the youth run cold , and it was only his previous experience in warfare which rendered him capable of doing what he knew was his duty .
" charge on them ! "
came the cry in japanese .
" kill them , or drive them back to their ship !
<unk> !  " " <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !  " was the yell .
" hurrah for japan ! "
the japanese had not expected a hand-to-hand fight and the closing in of the enemy aroused them as they had never been aroused before .
for the first time <name> saw the sailors and marines awakened to their full fighting fury  a fury in which every japanese <unk> death and thinks that to die is <name> for himself , his family , and his emperor .
they leaped on the russians with a ferocity that was appalling , and that first shock sent the czar 's men back to the deck from which they had come .
but the russians were likewise aroused , and with cheers and yells they came on once more , leaping over the bodies of those who had fallen , and meeting shot with shot and cutlass stroke with cutlass stroke .
officers and men fought side by side , and many went down to a common death .
by instinct <name> and <name> kept close together , with the others from <name> 's gun near at hand , and <name> <name> and <name> <name> not far away .
each used his cutlass as best he could , <unk> off the blows of the enemy and dealing cuts whenever a chance appeared .
<name> was glad that he had learned to use a cutlass so well , and soon found himself the match of almost any russian who challenged him .
the fighting was now spread over the decks of both vessels , which were hooked together tightly and pounding broadside at every swell of the ocean .
to attempt to blow up either ship would have been fatal probably to both  one dragging down the other  so no such attempt was made .
while the fighting was at its height , <name> suddenly found himself face to face with a russian lieutenant of marines .
the fellow had a pistol in his hand , and as <name> raised his cutlass to strike , he dropped the weapon on a level with the youth 's head and pulled the trigger .
had the bullet sped as intended it is likely <name> would have been killed .
but just as the trigger fell , <name> , who was at <name> 's side , knocked the pistol to one side with his cutlass and the bullet merely grazed <name> 's hair .
then <name> leaped forward and gave the russian lieutenant a thrust in the side which put the fellow out of the fight instantly .
for fully fifteen minutes the battle had now raged and it was growing hotter each instant .
all of the available men on each ship were in the fray , and the cries and yells which resounded were deafening .
" we certainly ca n't keep this fight up much longer ! "
panted <name> .
he had a cut on his left hand and one in the shoulder , but kept on with dogged determination .
" well , we ai n't goin ' to surrender ! "
grunted <name> .
" it 's fight or die , i guess ! "
and he leaped forward once more .
two tall russians were directly in front of the old yankee gunner , and both fell upon him with their cutlasses at the same instant .
<name> was capable of <unk> off the weapon of one , but he was no match for the pair , and it speedily looked as if they would surely kill him .
" back with ye ! "
he yelled , and swung his cutlass as rapidly as he could , but they crowded him still closer and then one made a thrust at his face and another at his body .
it was at this critical moment that <name> , who had been engaged with somebody else , saw his old war chum 's predicament .
with a leap he gained <name> 's side , and down came his cutlass with a sweeping blow on the wrist of one of the enemy .
the russian dropped his cutlass to the deck and staggered back , his hand almost severed from his arm .
then <name> slashed the other russian across the cheek , and both of the enemy hurried back behind the other fighters .
" good fer you , <name> ! "
panted <name> , when he could speak .
" they had me about cornered ! "
" these fellows certainly know how to put up a stiff fight . "
" you 're wounded yourself .
better go below . "
" no , i 'm going to see it out .
why do n't you go down yourself ? "
" it ai n't in me , thet 's why , " answered the old yankee gunner .
again came a fierce onslaught from the russians .
but the japanese now had another rifle gun in place , and sharpshooters were crowding the fighting tops .
the latter picked off the russian officers , and this created a momentary confusion .
then came a sudden order to unlock the two ships and this was done .
" the russian ship is going down ! "
was the yell , and the news proved true .
an explosion below decks had torn a hole in the russian <unk> bottom and she began to sink rapidly .
the scene was now indescribable .
both the russians and the japanese on the doomed vessel endeavored to reach the deck of the shohirika .
in this struggle the majority of the russians received the worst of it , and fully fifty of them , including not a few wounded , remained on board when the doomed warship took her final plunge beneath the waters of the sea .
eighteen japanese were likewise drowned , including two under officers .
" surrender , or we <name> drive you over the side ! "
was the command from the japanese , and utterly disheartened by the loss of their ship , the russians threw down their arms ; and the fierce and bloody contest was at an end .
the common sailors were driven forward and chained together or bound with ropes , and the officers were grouped near the stern , where a formal surrender was made by the captain of the lost ship giving up his sword .
this formality over , the japanese set to work at once , cleaning up the deck and caring for the wounded as well as the hospital accommodations of the shohirika would permit .
" i never wish to see another fight like that , " was <name> 's comment , when he had washed up and had his wounds dressed .
" it was simply a slaughter ! "
" right you are , lad , " answered <name> .
" an ' i reckon i 'm a-goin ' to <name> the scars o ' it down to my grave . "
the old yankee gunner had received several severe wounds , and he was glad enough to have <name> swing his hammock for him and lie down to rest .
the battle over , the captain of the shohirika sailed away , to look for the big brig once more and to report to the flagship of the fleet .
but the brig had taken time by the forelock and left for parts unknown .
" i suppose that is the last of shamhaven and peterson and my money , " said <name> , when this news reached him .
" i wish we had met that brig a week ago . "
" oh , it 's possible we may see her again , " said <name> , cheerfully .
" but it gets me that she ran away , unless she had something to run for . "
" she must have been carrying some <unk> of war , <name> . "
" it ai n't unlikely , lad .
well , she 's gone , an ' it ai n't no use to cry over spilt milk .
when you write to captain ponsberry you can tell him ye saw them two rascals an ' thet 's all the good it did . "
" do you know what i 'm thinking ? "
" well ? "
" i 'm thinking that brig was bound for port <name> , and she 'll slip into that port some dark and <name> night . "
" it 's a risky piece o ' business .
either our ships or the mines are likely to blow her up . "
" that is true .
but the russians at the port must be getting desperate , and they 'll most likely pay any kind of a price for supplies .
a captain who ran the blockade successfully could make a fortune , " returned <name> .
the young gunner 's mate was right in his surmise .
the big brig was a russian vessel in disguise and loaded to her fullest capacity with supplies for the <unk> seaport .
she had been fitted out at <unk> , but had taken a wide sea course , so as to pretend to have set sail from nagasaki .
several russian shipping merchants were interested in the venture , which was a private one , and among the number was <name> snokoff .
from captain barusky , snokoff had heard that fabulous prices could be obtained for needed commodities at port <name> , and he had invested nearly every <unk> he possessed in the enterprise .
if the vessel succeeded in reaching port <name> , captain barusky was to undertake the disposal of the goods shipped in snokoff 's name , and then the two were to divide the profits .
the big brig had come close to being wrecked off the coast of japan and during a <name> had run down a fishing smack containing shamhaven , peterson , and two japanese .
one japanese had been drowned , and the three others from the smack had been made to join the crew of the big brig .
this was agreeable to shamhaven and peterson , who did not wish to remain near nagasaki or at any place where captain ponsberry or <name> would be likely to discover them .
chapter xxxii fall of port <name>  conclusion " open , in the name of the czar ! "
such was the command which startled both <name> and <name> <name> , and for the moment each gazed at the other in horror , not knowing what to say or do .
" i must get away from here ! "
whispered the young captain , but scarcely had he spoken when there came a crash , and the front door of the residence swung in .
then half a dozen russians poured into the house .
" there he is , as i suspected ! "
said one , an officer from the prison .
" we 'll see that you do not escape again , " he added to <name> , grimly .
in the midst of the excitement <name> <name> arrived .
but he could do nothing for the young captain , and was glad that he was left to protect his daughter .
" we ought also to take her , " said the prison official .
" she did wrong to harbor this prisoner . "
and then , without further ado , <name> was marched back to the place from which he had escaped such a short while before .
after that the time passed dismally enough for the young american .
for having run away he was put on the most miserable fare the prison afforded , the food being often so vile he could not touch it .
whenever he attempted to protest he was met with kicks and blows .
" they might as well kill me and be done with it , " he thought .
" oh , how i wish the japs would take the city and give me back my <name> ! "
in those days port <name> became a most uncomfortable place for all living there .
the japanese army was pressing forward steadily , and army and navy did everything possible to destroy the shipping in the harbor and make the various forts untenable .
shots and shells were hurled into the city at all hours of the day and night , until living there became worse than a nightmare .
among the soldiers scurvy became prevalent , until the hospitals could not accommodate the sick and the dying .
nothing was done to clean up the streets , and the rubbish lay many feet deep over the sidewalks .
practically all of the shops were closed , for they had next to nothing to sell .
the main article of food was rice , and to cook this many old buildings had to be <unk> in order to procure necessary firewood .
as <name> approached the suffering of the poor became so intense that riots broke out and to maintain order not a few were shot down .
such was the condition in the city .
outside , to the northward , the fighting went on week after week .
so many soldiers were killed upon both sides that to bury the dead became impossible , and thousands were left where they had fallen , to become the prey of vultures , or to <unk> and fill the locality with a stench that was as <unk> as it was deadly !
such are the horrors of modern warfare .
the demands for universal peace can not come any too quickly .
in the advance on port <name> , <name> did his full share of the fighting .
the japanese were now struggling for the possession of what was known as <unk> hill , a <name> elevation which was not fortified but which was in the direct line of russian fire .
the top of <unk> hill commanded a fine view of port <name> and its harbor , and it was this view the japanese needed , in order to make their shell fire most effective .
the battle for <unk> hill is one which <name> be long remembered .
the japanese fought with a desperation impossible to describe , and when the hill was captured , general <unk> sent out nearly all his available men to <unk> it .
but this could not be accomplished , and late in december the japanese stormed the inner defenses of the russian chain of forts , killing nearly all of the brave defenders who dared to oppose them .
then tons upon tons of shot and shell were sent into port <name> and over the harbor once again , until the locality became little short of an inferno .
nearly all the shipping was destroyed , and so many buildings were set on fire that to stem the conflagration became all but impossible .
the end came on new year 's day , 1905  ten months after the famous siege began .
to hold out longer seemed impossible , and to avoid further carnage general <unk> called a council of war and sent a message to general <unk> offering to <unk> .
" port <name> has surrendered ! "
the news flew from one japanese regiment to another , and soon the warships were sending the message from vessel to vessel .
for once the japanese showed their real feelings , and " <unk> !
<unk> !  " rent the air again and again .
" long life to the mikado !
port <name> is ours once more ! "
" it is a <unk> victory ! "
cried <name> , when he heard the news .
" yes , lad , and i trust it brings this bloody war to a close , " came from <name> .
" they say general <unk> blew up the warships remaining in the harbor . "
" he could n't have had many left , " returned the old yankee gunner .
" the army and the navy have about battered everything to bits . "
and in this surmise <name> was correct .
the fall of port <name> caused <unk> consternation in russia , while the people of japan were correspondingly elated .
because of the gallant defense of the place , the japanese made generous terms with those who had surrendered , much to the satisfaction of the world at large .
many had predicted a universal butchery , but nothing of the sort occurred , and the russian sick and wounded were given every possible attention .
after the fall of the port <name> was permitted to go ashore some miles above the town , and he managed to locate <name> , and then learned for the first time that <name> was a prisoner in the captured place .
" a prisoner ! "
he ejaculated .
" oh , <name> , we must find him and have him released ! "
" that is just what i have been thinking , but i do n't know exactly how to go at it , <name> . "
" there ought to be some way of doing these things .
we might interview one of the generals and   who is that coming this way ? "
" why , it 's <name> himself ! "
cried <name> .
" <name> ! "
screamed <name> , and ran forward to meet his brother .
soon they were in each other 's arms , and then <name> received an equally warm greeting .
" we were released this morning , " said <name> .
" i can tell you i was mighty glad of it .
i have n't had a meal fit to eat in weeks . "
" well , you shall have the best our larder affords , " said <name> .
" my , but you 're a sight for sore eyes ! "
he continued .
" do n't say a word ! "
came from <name> .
two tears were glistening in his honest eyes .
" it 's almost too good to be true ! "
* * * * * here let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this tale of the naval and military adventures " at the fall of port <name> . "
after the surrender of the city the army in that vicinity , and also the fleet near the harbor , had but little to do outside of caring for the sick and wounded and disposing of the thousands of prisoners .
the russian officers were allowed to go on parole and the prisoners were transported to japan .
many of the mines in the harbor were taken up , so that ships might come and go in safety .
<name> was anxious to learn what had become of shamhaven and peterson , and through the japanese guards stationed in port <name> located the rascally sailors at a cheap boarding-house .
both were made prisoners , and <name> got back a portion of the money stolen from captain ponsberry and himself .
it was learned that the big brig had been destroyed by the japanese shell fire , so that <name> snokoff lost everything he placed in the venture .
" well , it served him right , " said <name> , when he heard of this .
" he is responsible for the time <name> spent in prison . "
what had become of captain barusky was at first a mystery .
but at last it was learned that he had sneaked aboard of a transport filled with wounded soldiers and bound for <unk> .
he pretended to be wounded himself , and was given medical attention until the trick was discovered , when he was treated as a coward .
as soon as <unk> was reached he disappeared , and that was the last seen or heard of him for some time .
" we are well rid of that fellow , " said <name> .
" i <name> the russians read him out of their army .
he is n't fit to hold a commission . "
" what do you imagine <name> be the next move in this war ? "
questioned <name> .
" it is hard to tell .
i think they <name> try to take <unk> , for one thing . "
" russia is going to send out more warships , " put in <name> .
" if they come this way , it may mean more fighting for me . "
" well , i reckon you 'll do your duty , if you are put to it , " answered <name> , with a smile .
" and so <name> you do yours , " came from <name> .
" we 'll all try to do our duty , " broke in <name> .
" we did n't join the army and the navy to <name> back .
just the same , i 'd enjoy a bit of a rest just now . "
the others agreed that the rest would be beneficial all around .
it was given to them ; and here , for the present at least , we <name> leave them , wishing them the best of good luck in the future .

grosset & dunlap publishers new york copyright , 1901 , by the <unk> company [ illustration : defending the fort . ]
preface .
" boys of the fort " is a complete story in itself , but forms the fifth volume of a line of works issued under the general title of " flag of freedom series . "
in <unk> this tale i had it in mind to acquaint my young readers with the ins and outs of military life at one of our western forts of to-day , showing what both officers and privates are called upon to do , and what troubles the indians and the bad men of that locality are still in the habit of making .
the field is one about which little has been written , although abounding in interest , and one which is worthy the attention of all who have the proper development of our country at heart .
to some , certain scenes in this book may appear <unk> , yet such is far from being the case .
in this wild territory there are those who have lived all their lives beyond the pale of civilization , men who grow up dwarfed and crooked in mind , and who resent every effort made to better their condition .
the young captain is a fine specimen of the wide-awake american army officer , yet he is no more brave and dashing than are thousands of others , officers and privates , who serve under our flag of freedom .
he is trained to do his duty , and he simply does it , regardless of possible consequences .
once more i take this opportunity to thank my young friends for the kindness with which they have received my former stories , and i earnestly <name> this present tale merits equal commendation .

boys of the fort .
chapter i .
bound for the fort .
" how many miles have we still to ride , benson ? "
" about fifty , <name> .
but the last half is pretty much uphill , lad . "
" can we make the fort by to-morrow night ? "
" well , we can try , " answered the old scout , who sat astride of a coal-black horse and rode slightly in advance of his two youthful companions .
" it <name> depend somewhat on what the weather does . "
" why , do you think it is going to rain ? "
put in darry germain .
" i 'm sure it looks clear enough . "
" aint no telling what the weather <name> do in this valley , " answered <name> benson .
" it may stay clear for a week , but to me the signs do n't exactly p'int that way , " and he shook his head gravely .
" a little rain would n't hurt , " said <name> moore .
" a couple of miles back the road was fearfully <name> . "
" the trouble is , when it rains out here it rains , " answered the old scout .
" the clouds come <unk> over yonder mountains , and inside of half an hour you 'd fancy the water was going to drown out everything . "
" then if it rains we 'll have to put up somewhere , " said darry germain .
" aint no cabin on this trail short of <name> leeson 's place , twenty miles this side of the fort .
if we can get that far i reckon we can make the fort . "
" then where <name> we stop to-night ? "
asked darry with interest .
" at the <name> hotel  if the sky is clear , " said <name> benson , with a laugh at what he considered his little joke .
" you mean in the open , under the stars ! "
cried the boy ; and , as the old scout nodded , he went on : " that <name> be nice .
i 've been wanting to camp out in regular trapper style ever since we left <unk> . "
" so have i , " put in <name> moore .
" but i do n't know as i care to camp out and get soaked . "
" if it rains we 'll find some kind of shelter , " answered benson .
" but come , let us make the most of the daylight while it lasts , " and he urged his steed forward , and the two boys did the same .
the three were pursuing their way along a gap in the <name> mountains , where the so-called valley was broken up by <name> <unk> , walls of rock , and dense patches of forest and underbrush .
it was midsummer , and the hot air was filled with the scent of green growing things .
deep in the forest the song-birds sang gayly and the wild animals had full play to come and go as they pleased , for to get at them in those vast fastnesses was next to impossible .
the party of three had left the town of <unk> four days before .
they were bound for fort <name> ,  so named after <name> <name> , the celebrated scout and indian fighter ,  and <name> benson carried messages of importance to colonel fairfield , the commandant at the fort .
<name> moore and darry germain were cousins , and both were boys of sixteen , well built and well trained in outdoor athletic sports .
<name> came from chicago and darry from st. <name> , and each had graduated from his local high school but a few weeks before .
it was while darry was spending a brief vacation with his cousin <name> that a plan for visiting the fort was formed .
<name> 's older brother , <name> , was a west point graduate and a captain at the fort , and he wrote on stating that he had received permission to have <name> visit him , and darry could come too if he desired .
colonel fairfield was an old friend of both families , and promised to treat the lads well should they make the trip .
" hurrah !
just the thing ! "
<name> had cried .
" of course you 'll go , darry .
we could n't have a grander outing . "
" i 'll go if father and mother <name> let me , " had been darry 's answer , and he had at once written home concerning the affair .
two weeks later the boys were off , the parents of each <unk> them to be careful , and wishing them the best of luck .
the journey westward as far as the <unk> of <unk> had occurred without special incident .
they had been told to hire a guide at this point , and while looking for a man had fallen in with <name> benson .
benson knew captain <name> moore well , and he at once promised to take the boys along with him and do the best he could by them .
" you 'll want good hosses , " benson had said , and had aided them in selecting their animals and in getting together the necessary outfit .
the start was made one fine morning in <name> , and all three of the party were in the best of spirits .
the four days in the mountains had opened the eyes of both lads .
the traveling had been rather hard , yet they had enjoyed every minute of the journey .
they had stopped once to do some fishing , and benson had brought down a small mountain deer .
at night they had put up at the cabins of hunters and trappers , and before retiring had listened to thrilling tales of adventures with wild beasts and with the indians .
but now <name> was anxious to get to the fort and see his brother , from whom he had been separated for nearly two years .
darry was also anxious to reach the <unk> , to meet not only his cousin <name> , but likewise colonel fairfield , who was an old friend not easily forgotten .
once at the fort the two boys felt that a vacation full of fun and pleasure would follow .
never once did they dream of the perils which awaited them in that wild region , which was not as civilized as it was to become a handful of years later .
" it seems to me it is growing hotter , " remarked darry , after riding a quarter of a mile in silence .
" it is growing hotter , " answered the old scout .
" and that makes me more certain than ever that a storm 's at hand . "
" we 'll have to take what comes , " said <name> .
" but i did <name> we 'd reach the fort by to-morrow . "
on they went , around a bend of the trail and over some rough rocks , where the horses had to step with care , for fear of slipping into a gully on the left .
then they reached a patch of timber and plunged beneath the <unk> trees .
here it was both dark and cool , and darry breathed a long sigh of relief .
" how delicious ! "
he murmured .
" it 's almost like going into a cave .
benson , there must be lots of caves in these mountains , " he went on reflectively .
" there are , " answered the old scout .
" i 've been in a score or more . "
" i should like to explore a big cave , " came from <name> .
" it would be a novelty to me . "
" you may get the chance , lad , " said benson ; " and get it soon . "
" what do you mean ?
are we going to ride by a cave ? "
" there are a dozen or more ahead , and we may have to seek one of 'em for shelter .
do you hear that ? "
benson threw back his head to listen , and the two boys did likewise .
from a great distance came the rumble of thunder , echoing and <unk> throughout the mountains .
to the westward the sun was hidden by a dense mass of black clouds which grew more ominous each instant .
" the storm is coming , sure enough , " muttered <name> .
" what do you propose ? "
" we 'll ride on a bit , lad .
it wo n't hit us right away .
come ! "
the horses were urged forward at an increased speed , and soon they passed the patch of timber and came out to where a thick fringe of brush skirted a long , high <name> .
the sky was now dark on every side , and the wind was rising with a dull , humming sound .
" we 'll catch it in a few minutes ! "
cried benson ; and hardly had he spoken when the big drops came splashing down , hitting the broad leaves in the underbrush with resounding <unk> .
the old scout continued to lead , and presently he turned to the left , where the <name> parted .
here was an opening , lined on either side with rocks and dirt , and a short distance further was the entrance to a cave of unknown depths .
" we 'll stop here , " said the old scout , leaping to the ground , followed by the boys .
" this aint the best place in the world , but it 's better than the open , in such a blow as is coming . "
he was right about the blow  already the wind was rising , and hardly had the three led their horses into the cave , the entrance to which was over a dozen feet high , when there came a crashing through the timber left behind , which sent many a frail limb and sapling to the ground and carried the leaves and twigs in all directions .
" i 'm glad we did n't stay in the woods ! "
cried darry .
" we 'd be in danger of falling trees . "
" and lightning too , " added <name> .
" oh , my !
look at that ! "
he continued , as a blinding flash lit up the heavens .
" that must have struck somewhere . "
" we 'll go back a little , " said old benson .
" the lightning is just as bad here as it is in the woods .
wait till i get a torch . "
pine was plentiful in that locality , and soon he had a knot which was full of pitch and which burned well when a match was applied to it .
with the torch in hand , he led the way further into the cave , and the boys followed with their animals .
chapter ii .
caves in the mountain .
the two boys had expected to find the large cave damp and unwholesome , and they were surprised when they learned how dry the flooring and the sides were , and how pure the air was .
there was no breeze in the place , but a gentle draught kept the air stirring .
of course the atmosphere was much cooler than it had been outside .
hardly had the travelers gained the center of the first chamber of the cave , when the storm outside burst in all its fury .
the lightning and thunder were almost incessant , and the rain came down in broad sheets which completely obliterated the landscape .
" it 's little short of a flood , " said darry , after having gone to the mouth of the cave to investigate .
" the water is already two or three inches deep on the trail . "
" well , such a downpour ca n't last long , " returned <name> .
" it 's only a shower , or a <unk> . "
" no , it 's a regular rain , and it 's good for all night , " answered the old scout .
" all night ! "
" yes , lad , and we 'll be lucky if it do n't last through the morning , too .
it do n't rain very often out here , you see , but when it does it tries to make up for lost time . "
" then we 'll have to camp right here , wo n't we ? "
" to be sure .
even if it did let up , you would n't want to camp in the wet timber . "
" then we might as well start up a fire , " came from darry , in something of a disappointed tone .
" i was hoping we 'd be able to camp under the stars just once before we got to the fort . "
" perhaps you 'll get a chance to go out after you 're at the fort , " said the old scout , by way of comfort .
" yes , we 'll start a fire , if we can find any dry wood . "
the horses were tied up between some rocks , and then the three searched around .
at the entrance to the cave was a mass of brush and tree limbs which previous storms had sent in that direction , and from this they gathered enough for a good-sized fire .
it did not take long for the brush to blaze up , sending the sparks to the roof of the cave and throwing fantastic shadows all about them .
" i declare , the fire makes the cave look quite <unk> ! "
was <unk> comment , as he threw himself down on a flat rock with his blanket under him .
" staying here wo n't be so <unk> as i anticipated . "
" i 'm going to explore the cave , now i am here , " returned darry .
" who knows but what i might locate a gold mine ! "
" you be careful of where you go , " cautioned old benson .
" these caves are full of pitfalls , and now you two boys are with me i do n't want anything to happen to you .
if something did happen , neither captain moore nor colonel fairfield would forgive me . "
" to be sure we 'll be careful , benson , " answered darry .
" there 'd be no fun in getting hurt  even if we did locate a gold mine . "
" you wo n't find any gold mine here .
this ground was <unk> years ago  before even the fort was located .
i came out here once myself , with a miner named hooker brown .
hooker was dead certain there was gold here , but although we stayed here about two weeks nosing around we never got even a smell of the yellow metal . "
" well , we 'll have a look around , anyway , " said <name> .
" but we must get good torches first . "
pine knots were procured and lit ; and , with another caution from the scout to be careful , they set off , leaving benson to care for the horses and prepare such an evening meal as their stores afforded .
luckily the scout had brought down half a dozen good-sized birds , and these he now prepared to broil in true <name> style .
the front chamber of the cave was somewhat <unk> , and behind this were several other irregular apartments , running down to a passageway which wound in and out between jagged rocks almost impossible to climb or explore in any manner .
at a distance could be heard the trickling of water , but where this came from , or where it went to , nobody in the cave could imagine .
the boys advanced from one opening to another with care , one with his torch held high , that they might see ahead , and the other with the light close to the ground , to warn them of a possible pitfall .
" a regiment of soldiers could quarter in here , " observed darry , as they pushed on .
" what a defense it would make ! "
" an enemy could fire right into the entrance .
and , besides , supposing the enemy started to smoke you out ?
i can smell the smoke from the camp-fire away back here . "
at last the two boys reached the passageway back of the rear chamber , and here came to a halt .
the dropping water could be plainly heard , and <name> flashed his torch in several directions in the <name> of catching sight of the stream .
" i 'm going to climb the rocks , " he said , after a pause .
" perhaps there is another opening behind them . "
" remember what benson said , and be careful , " cautioned his cousin .
" there is no use in taking a risk for nothing . "
" yes , i 'll be careful , " answered <name> , and crawled forward with care .
darry held his torch as high up as possible , to light the way .
the youth had advanced a distance of fifty feet when he came to a turn in the passageway .
here the side walls were not over two yards apart , while the roof could be touched with ease .
thinking the walking better at this point , <name> struck out once more .
the flare from his torch showed him something of a chamber ahead , and the water sounded closer than ever .
but hardly had the lad taken a dozen steps when the smooth rock upon which he was advancing tilted up , sending him headlong .
as he went down the torch was knocked from his hand .
then he slid forward into the darkness .
" help ! "
he managed to cry .
" help ! "
" what 's up ? "
came from darry , but the words were drowned out in the crashing of one stone against another .
in the meantime <name> had fallen , he knew not whither .
he landed on some soft ground , turned over and slid along , and then took a second drop .
a stone fell beside him and pinned his jacket to the ground .
for the moment the lad was too dazed and bewildered to do anything but try to get back his breath .
then , as it gradually dawned upon him that he was not hurt in the least , he endeavored to arise .
" fast ! "
he muttered , and tore his jacket away from under the rock .
then he turned about , trying to locate his torch .
but that was missing , and all was dark around him .
" i 'm in a pickle now , " he thought .
" i wish i had taken old <unk> advice and remained around the camp-fire .
but who would have imagined that big rock would play a fellow such a trick ?
how in the world am i to get back again ? "
from a great distance he could hear darry shouting to him .
he tried to answer his cousin , but whether or not his voice was heard he could not tell .
with his hands before him , he moved around , and scarcely had he taken a dozen steps when he slid down a <name> incline .
here there was water ; and he shivered , thinking he might be dropping into an underground stream from which there would be no escape .
but when a pool was gained it proved to be but several inches deep .
as <name> stood in the pool there came a sudden rumble of thunder to his ears .
he listened , and by the sounds became convinced that an opening into the outer air could not be a great way off .
then came an unexpected flash of reflected light on the rocks by his side .
" hurrah , that light came from outside ! "
he cried .
" i 'm not buried alive , after all .
but i may be a good way from daylight yet . "
he had some matches in his box , and lighting one of these he discovered a passageway below him , running off to his left .
further on he picked up a bit of dry wood and lit this .
it made rather a poor torch , but proved better than nothing .
" now to get out , and then to find my way back to where i left old benson , " was his mental resolve .
with extreme caution he stole forward to where the lightning revealed a distant opening .
he did not leave one foothold until he was sure of the next , for he had no <name> to experiment with another moving rock .
the thunder now reached his ears plainly , and the lightning at times made the front of the cave as bright as day .
" it 's quite another place , " was his thought .
" that dangerous passage connects the two . "
suddenly , as <name> was advancing , he heard a clatter of horses ' hoofs , and into the cave ahead rode three rough-looking men , all armed with rifles and pistols and each carrying small saddle-bags across his steed .
at first <name> thought to call out to the newcomers , but he checked himself , for their appearance was decidedly against them .
" i 'll try to find out something about them first , " he muttered .
" perhaps they belong to that gang of bad men benson was telling us about yesterday . "
and then , as the three came to a halt in the center of the outer cave and dismounted , he crept closer , in the shadow of some sharp rocks , to overhear what they might have to say .
chapter iii .
an important conversation .
" who ever saw such a downpour before ? "
growled one of the three men , as he switched the water from his soft felt hat .
" i 'm wet to the skin . "
" i 'm no better off , " replied one of the others .
" i think we were fools to leave macklin 's place , gilroy . "
" just what i think , fetter , " said the third man .
" we could have waited as well as not . "
" yes , we could have waited , potts , " answered <name> gilroy ; " but , to tell the truth , i do n't want to trust macklin too far .
he might play us foul . "
" he would n't dare to do that , " returned <name> fetter .
" why not  if he thought he would get a reward ? "
came from nat potts , the youngest of the trio .
" one thing is certain , macklin is crazy to make money . "
" i know a thing or two of macklin 's past  that 's why , " went on <name> fetter .
" if he got us into trouble i would n't keep silent about him , and he knows it . "
" macklin is slippery , no two ways about it , " said <name> gilroy , as he took off his jacket and wrung the water out .
" i am not inclined to trust him , and that is all there is to it . "
" did he ever belong to the old gang ? "
questioned nat potts .
" some say he did , and some say he did n't . "
" he was a <unk> , that 's all , " came from <name> gilroy .
" he was always afraid to take the chances of being shot , but was on hand when the spoils were divided .
they used him as a messenger and a spy , but i don't believe he ever really helped to hold up a coach . "
" humph , then it 's a wonder the old crowd had anything to do with him ! "
" oh , they had to have messengers and spies , and they never gave macklin more than was coming to him , you can bet on that !
i understand that when the <unk> coach was held up six years ago , and the gang got twenty-two thousand dollars , they gave macklin five hundred , and he was glad to get that . "
" that was a big haul ! "
cried nat potts enthusiastically .
" i wish i had been in it . "
" the gang was followed for two days  by the soldiers under colonel fairfield , " went on <name> gilroy , as he threw himself on the rocks , leaving his companions to start up a fire .
" they had a hot time of it over to bear pass , i can tell you .
two men were shot , and one of them , <name> <unk> , my old chum , died from his wounds .
they say colonel fairfield himself fired the shot that took poor <unk> in the head , and if that 's so  well , i 've got an account to square with the colonel , that 's all . "
" you can square that after we 've had our little interview with the quartermaster , " returned <name> fetter with a hard laugh .
" that 's right  we 'll be sure to have the soldiers after us , " put in nat potts .
" they 'll be doubly mad when they learn that the <unk> resulted in the emptying of the box with their wages . "
" it <name> be a good haul if it goes through , boys .
the quartermaster <name> be carrying not less than twelve thousand dollars of the <unk> money besides his other stuff , " returned <name> gilroy .
here the conversation came to a temporary end , for nat potts had produced a black flask , from which each of the men took a deep draught .
then potts and fetter started in to build a roaring fire at which all might dry their clothing , leaving gilroy , the leader of the crowd , to do as he pleased .
<name> had listened to the talk with mingled interest and horror .
it did not take him long to realize the truth  that these men were thoroughly bad , and that they had been mixed up in road robberies of the past and were contemplating another robbery some time in the future .
" they mean to <name> the quartermaster of the fort , when he is bringing in the soldiers ' wages from <unk> , " he thought .
" and that leader is going to shoot down the colonel if he can .
who would imagine men could be so bad !
and that leader seems to be educated , too ! "
<name> would have been very much surprised had he known the truth , which was that <name> gilroy , often called the shadow , was a <unk> man , having passed through one of the leading <unk> of learning of the pacific coast .
but , following this college career , gilroy had forged checks and committed a burglary , in company with an old chum named <unk> , and then the two had left sacramento " between two days . "
<unk> had immediately joined the " knights of the road " and been shot down , as previously mentioned .
gilroy had drifted first to the mississippi and then to <name> , and had not gone into the mountains until later .
now he was at the head of a desperate gang , numbering ten or a dozen , who had already committed several " <unk> " of importance .
soon the fire was burning brightly , and the three men took off part of their wearing apparel , that the articles might dry .
they had brought some food with them , and as they sat eating and drinking they continued to discuss their plans .
nat potts , who was not over nineteen or twenty , was evidently something of a new member , and asked many questions regarding the organization , and as he took in what was told him , so did <name> , listening with " all ears , " as the saying goes .
" they must be as bad a crowd as can be found anywhere , " thought the youth .
" i wonder what they would do with me , if they found out i had been listening to their talk ?
perhaps they 'd kill me on the spot . "
and he gave a shiver .
the thunder and lightning had gradually abated , but with the coming of night the rain continued as steadily as ever .
fortunately for the desperadoes , however , the rocks sloped away from the entrance to the cave , so that no water came inside , while the fire made everybody quite comfortable .
hardly knowing what to do , <name> continued behind the rocks , taking care to remain in the shadow .
more than once he was afraid one or another of the men would start to investigate the surroundings and that he would be discovered .
" i wish they would go to sleep , " he said to himself .
" then i might get a chance to slip past them and their horses . "
with great impatience he watched the men finish up their supper , get out their pipes , and fall to smoking .
in the meantime the horses had been led to the opposite side of the cave and fastened to the rocks .
as <name> waited for a chance to get away he wondered what darry and old benson were doing .
more than likely they were looking for him .
but were they in that other cave , at the narrow passageway , or did the old scout know of this second cave and the secret entrance to it ?
" if benson leads the way around to here there may be trouble , " he mused .
" it would be better if i could get out and head him off .
but if i do get out , how shall i turn to find the trail we were pursuing ?
in this darkness a fellow could n't see his hand before his face . "
at last fetter threw himself down on a blanket to rest , leaving gilroy and potts still conversing earnestly by the fire .
the two desperadoes talked in a low tone , so that <name> now caught but little of what was said .
the backs of both men were turned toward the side of the cave where <name> was in hiding ; and , plucking up courage , the youth started forward on tiptoe , bent upon getting out of the cave before the men should make some move which would expose him .
step by step he advanced , until he reached a point where he was within a dozen feet of gilroy and almost as close to potts .
he hardly dared to breathe , and his heart thumped madly beneath his jacket .
but the men continued to smoke and talk , unconscious of his proximity .
at the entrance to the cave the rocks were somewhat rough and the mist had made them slippery .
<name> was crawling forward rapidly , when one foot slipped , and he pitched headlong , making considerable noise .
" what was that ? "
cried <name> gilroy , and leaped to his feet .
he had been gazing into the fire , and for the moment could make out little in the darkness .
" i do n't know , " returned nat potts .
" something moving around out there , i think . "
and the younger man reached for his pistol , which still remained in his belt .
as rapidly as he could <name> sprang to his feet .
a good bit of his wind had been knocked out of him , but he felt that he must not delay , and he ran for the outer air gasping for breath .
" hi !
stop ! "
roared <name> gilroy , catching sight of him at last .
" stop , i tell you ! "
" a boy ! "
ejaculated nat potts .
" he must have been hiding in here ! "
" if he was he overheard too much , " growled gilroy .
" come , we must catch him by all means , " and he ran after <name> , with potts following .
chapter iv .
lost in the forest .
" i must get away from them ! "
this was the one thought which surged through <name> moore 's <name> as he dashed from the cave in the mountain .
he felt that if he was captured it would go hard with him .
did the desperadoes learn that he had overheard their conversation , they might make his very life pay the forfeit .
forward he pitched , into the rain and the inky darkness , not knowing in what direction and just then caring but little .
his one idea was to put distance between himself and his pursuers .
" stop ! "
he heard the men call , and heard the clicking of a pistol hammer .
then he reached some brushwood , and , crouching low , continued to move on .
no shot came , for the reason that the desperadoes could not locate him with certainty .
at length <name> reached a clump of trees .
had he not had his hands before him he might have run into them head first .
he glided around them , and then continued onward , down a slope leading into a broad belt of timber .
still with his hands before him , he advanced through the undergrowth and between the stately trees for a distance of several hundred feet .
he was now exhausted with running and with fighting the <unk> vines , and had to halt to catch his breath .
as he came to a stop he listened attentively , to learn if the men were following , but the downpour of rain drowned out every other sound .
soaked to the skin , hatless , and still short of breath , he went on once more , feeling that he was not yet far enough from the cave for safety .
he tried to steer a course in the direction of the cave where he had left darry and the old scout , but whether he was successful or not he could not tell .
a hundred yards further and <name> came to another slope , covered with prairie grass .
down this he rolled in the darkness , to bring up in more brush below .
then he climbed out of the hollow at the opposite side , and , reaching a large fallen tree , sat down to rest and think over his situation .
the tree lay partly under one with <unk> branches , so the boy was somewhat sheltered from the storm .
it must be confessed that <name> 's heart sank within him as he reviewed the situation .
where he was he could not tell , nor could he form any definite plan for <unk> his cousin and old benson .
more than this , he was afraid that the desperadoes might come up at any minute and pounce upon him .
but as the minutes slipped by , and he neither saw nor heard anything of those in pursuit , he grew easier .
evidently they had given up the <name> .
" i <name> they have , " was what he thought .
" i never want to get so close to them again .
they are a hard crowd , if ever there was one .
if i can get to the fort and tell colonel fairfield of what i 've heard , i 'll be doing a good thing . "
an hour went by slowly , and then <name> looked around to find some means of making himself comfortable for the balance of the night , knowing it would be useless to pursue his course through the forest in the darkness .
" this is camping out with a vengeance ! "
he muttered grimly .
" darry ought to be along ; i guess he 'd soon get enough of it .
i 'll be lucky if i do n't fall in with some savage animal . "
the thought of wild beasts gave him another shiver , and he concluded to climb into a nearby tree , which was <unk> and had a spot where several branches made a sort of platform .
he was soon up in a comparatively dry place , and here he fell asleep , being too tired to hold his eyes open longer .
when <name> awoke the storm had cleared away and the sun was struggling through the scattering clouds .
the forest still dripped with the rain , and with this dripping were mingled the songs of the birds and the hum of insects .
stiff from the wet , he climbed slowly to the ground and looked around .
on every side were the tall trees and the dense undergrowth , shutting off the distant view of everything but a towering mountain to the westward .
this was the mountain he and the others had been ascending when the storm had overtaken them .
" i suppose i may as well head in that direction , " he mused .
" if i can strike the trail that <name> be something .
but i 'll have to keep my eyes open , or i may fall into the hands of that gilroy gang . "
he was hungry , but there were no means at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of his stomach , and so he had to move forward without eating .
getting into the forest had been difficult , but getting out was even more of a task .
the underbrush at certain points was positively impassable , and he had to make long <unk> , which took time and tired him greatly .
at noon he was still in the forest , and the mountain seemed as far off as ever .
" i am lost , that is all there is to it ! "
he burst out with a groan .
" i am lost , and perhaps i 'll never get out ! "
the sun shone down directly on his head , and even though still wet he was glad enough to seek the shelter the stately trees afforded .
here and there he saw some berries of various hues , but they were strange to him , and he did not dare touch them for fear of being poisoned .
toward the middle of the afternoon he reached a <name> <name> , flowing between the rocks , and here he again rested .
he reached the conclusion that the <name> came down from the mountain side and by following it up he must sooner or later run across the lost trail .
" i 'll follow it , anyway , " he told himself , and , hungry and footsore , set out along the water-course .
here the walking was somewhat better , for he had no brushwood and vines to tear aside .
the <name> was clear , and he often saw trout and other fish darting hither and thither .
this gave him an idea , and , picking some berries he had seen , he dropped them in .
at once some of the fish darted forward and swallowed the berries .
" hurrah , a good bait ! "
he cried , and quickly made himself a line out of threads from his clothing .
to this he attached a pin bent into shape with infinite care .
then he baited with the berries , and dropped the line in over a rock near a cottonwood .
hardly had his bait touched the water when a good-sized fish seized it , and in a twinkling he had his catch landed .
his heart gave a bound , for here was the material for at least one square meal .
" i 'll cook it right away , " he told himself , after feeling to see if he had any matches .
his hunger was beginning to make him desperate , and he did not much care even if the desperadoes did see his camp-fire .
with some trouble he got together a few sticks of wood and some moss which the <name> had dried out , and soon he had a respectable blaze between two rocks .
with his <unk> he cleaned the fish as best he could , and then broiled it on a green twig .
when done the meat was slightly burnt on one side and <unk> on the other , but to the <unk> lad nothing had ever tasted sweeter , and he continued to eat until the whole fish was gone .
" now i feel like myself , " he muttered , after washing down the repast with a drink from the <name> .
" on a pinch that meal ought to last me until to-morrow noon , and surely i ought to find my way back to the others by that time . "
with renewed energy he continued his tramp along the <name> , often wading in the water when the brushwood on either side was extra thick .
he kept his eyes and ears on the alert , but no human being came into sight , and presently a great feeling of loneliness swept over him .
" i 'm alone , " he whispered to himself .
" alone !
i must say i do n't like it much , " and he hurried on faster than ever .
the sun was shining over the distant mountain when he reached a bend in the <name> and came out upon a <name> trail which crossed the water-course at a right <name> .
as he looked at the trail he was tempted to shout with <name> .
" the place we crossed yesterday morning ! "
he exclaimed .
" there is the very spot where we got a drink and watered the horses .
now i ought not to have such a hard time finding the cave . "
he got down and examined the trail closely , hoping to discover some <unk> .
but the heavy rain had washed everything clean .
nevertheless , he felt certain that he was right , and hurried along as fast as his tired limbs permitted .
leaving the <name> , the trail wound in and out along a series of rocks and then through some heavy brushwood and along the edge of a jagged <name> .
the <name> was overgrown with heavy vines , which <name> down and brushed <name> 's head as he passed .
" i ca n't be more than three or four miles from the cave , " thought the boy .
" and if i hurry   " he stopped short , and then gave a cry of terror , and with good reason .
he had seen the vines ahead suddenly part , and now there came to view the shaggy head of a black bear .
as soon as the beast caught sight of the boy he leaped to the trail and advanced upon him .
chapter v. the big black bear .
<name> had never before met a black bear in the open air , but he had seen several in menageries and studied them at a safe distance , and he realized that he was in a perilous position .
the bear looked both <unk> and fierce and as if nothing would suit him better than to hug the lad to death and eat him up afterward .
<name> did not stand upon the order of his going , but went instantly , running as fast as his tired limbs would permit .
after him came the bear , and it was astonishing what good time the beast could make considering his size and his general appearance of <unk> .
looking over his shoulder , the lad soon saw that the beast was slowly but surely lessening the distance between them .
" shoo ! "
he yelled , and waved his arm threateningly , but the bear did not mind in the least .
he trotted on until less than two rods separated boy and beast .
then <name> reached some underbrush and rocks , with a <unk> tree in their midst , and without stopping to think twice he climbed into the tree and to one of the upper branches .
hardly had he reached what he thought might prove a temporary place of safety when he realized his mistake .
the bear came up the tree after him ,  slowly , it is true ; but still up ,  and this caused <name> 's hair to fairly stand upon end .
" i 'm a gone one now ! "
he groaned , and then espied another tree growing not far away .
a limb could just be reached , and as the bear almost gained the boy 's foot <name> swung himself from the first tree into the second .
as the lad gained a safe spot on the tree limb , the bear , coming to a halt on the branch opposite , set up a growl of rage and disappointment .
for a minute he surveyed the situation , then came out on the branch slowly , testing it inch by inch .
as it bent down he retreated , letting out a second growl , louder than the other .
<name> was wondering if he could drop to the ground and escape in that manner , when he saw the bear descend and come quickly toward the tree he was on .
he watched the beast closely , and waited until it was close to him .
then he made a leap back into the tree from which he had originally come .
again the bear came out as far as possible on a limb , and again he let out a growl of rage and disappointment .
in one way the situation was comical , and <name> might have laughed had he not felt so serious .
" we can keep this up a long time , i reckon , " thought the boy .
" and as long as you do n't try to leap after me i 'll be safe . "
finding he could not reach the boy by coming up one tree or the other , the black bear descended slowly to the ground .
then he walked around both trees several times , and at last came to a halt between the two .
here he sank down , as if to rest , but nevertheless kept one eye open and fixed upon <name> .
" he 's going on guard !
he means to keep me <unk> ! "
muttered the boy , and again his heart sank .
he remembered a story he had once read , in which a bear had starved a man to death and eaten him afterward .
would mr. bruin do so in this case ?
he wished he had a pistol , or a hunting-knife , or even a fair-sized stone .
but he had nothing except a thin club , which he had cut for himself with his <unk> .
this he kept in hand , and also kept the knife open and where he could get at it readily if needed .
half an hour went by ,  a time that to <name> seemed a whole day ,  and still the black bear remained between the two trees , dozing with one eye and watching with the other .
the sight of the beast taking it so easy was maddening under the circumstances , and at last the youth cut another club and hurled it down on top of the bear .
at once the beast flew up with a roar , and , standing on his hind legs , snapped his teeth at <name> .
then he flew up the tree once more , faster than ever before .
as the bear came up , <name> went higher than before , having seen another friendly limb over his head .
he was sorely tempted to reach for the beast with his club , but thought best not to run too much of a risk .
as before , the youth swung to the next tree , and again the bear gave a growl and went down .
then , being near the top of the tree , the lad took a good look around .
in a moment a sight caught his eye which caused his heart to jump with delight .
there on the trail were darry and old benson , riding along slowly .
" hi !
hi !
this way ! "
he shouted , with all the strength of his lungs .
" this way , darry !
this way , benson ! "
he saw his cousin and the guide bring their steeds to a halt and gaze around in wonder .
to them the voice appeared to come out of the very air itself .
" it 's <name> 's voice ! "
exclaimed darry .
" but i must say i do n't see him . "
both gazed around , and at last the scout caught sight of the boy's handkerchief fluttering among the tree branches .
" there he is ! "
he exclaimed .
" but what 's he doing up there ? "
" this way ! "
went on <name> , and as they turned in the direction , he added , " look out for the bear ! "
" a bear ! "
came from darry .
" he must be <unk> ! "
" i reckon you 've struck it , " muttered benson , and hastily unslung his rifle , at which darry did the same .
" follow me , but be on your guard , " went on the old scout .
he advanced with caution , his horse lifting his ears sharply as the neighborhood of the trees was gained .
presently the animal came to a sudden halt .
at the same moment benson caught sight of the bear .
" so that 's where ye are ! "
muttered the old scout .
the bear raised himself on his hind legs and let out a growl at the newcomers .
hardly had the sound arose upon the air when benson 's rifle cracked , and a bullet hit the beast in the breast .
down went the animal on all fours , but did not tumble further .
instead , he made a swift bound for the scout 's horse .
crack !
it was now darry 's rifle that spoke up , and the bear was hit again , this time in the right front knee .
he dropped , but quickly arose , shaking the wounded leg in the air and uttering a tremendous roar of pain and rage .
[ illustration : " now darry 's rifle spoke up , and the bear was hit again " ] neither horse would now stand still , and both danced around so lively that each rider had all he could do to keep his saddle .
but even while his steed pranced in this fashion , old benson managed to draw his pistol , and two additional shots rang out , both hitting the bear in the side .
the roars of the beast were now incessant , and the horses threatened to bolt in spite of all the riders could do to stop them .
" come ! "
cried the old scout , and turned from the scene .
thinking he meant to go off to reload , darry followed .
but when at a safe distance benson sprang to the ground and tied his horse to a tree .
" i 'd rather finish him afoot , " explained the old <name> , and slipped another cartridge into his rifle .
" you can stay here if you wish . "
" not much ! "
murmured darry , and came down also .
in a minute he was following the old scout .
when they came up a second time they found the bear crawling around , roaring in a lower tone .
evidently he was more than half exhausted .
" another good shot <name> finish him , " sang out <name> , from a bottom limb of the tree .
" why do n't you give it to him in the ear ? "
" i <name> , " answered the old scout , and circled around , watching his opportunity .
at length it came  the rifle cracked sharply , and bruin fell on his side , to rise no more .
" hurrah !
that 's a big haul ! "
cried darry , much delighted .
" i was wishing we 'd get a bear some time while we were out here . "
" it 's lucky the bear did n't get <name> , " remarked benson .
" they generally come up a tree after their victim . "
" i jumped from one tree to the other , " answered the youth .
" but i had quite an exciting time , i can assure you . "
" how in the world did you get here ? "
questioned darry , as <name> leaped to the ground .
" did you get through to another cave ?
benson thought that might be the case . "
" that was the case , darry .
and i 've had a wonderful adventure , too , " added <name> earnestly .
then he told his story , to which the others listened with close attention .
when he came to mention gilroy , fetter , and potts , old benson uttered a low whistle .
" so that gang has turned up again , eh ? "
muttered the old scout .
" this <name> be news to colonel fairfield .
i reckon he 'll be glad to be put on guard .
if the quartermaster was held up it would prove a big loss . "
" is it true that colonel fairfield killed this gilroy 's chum ? "
" perhaps he did .
the colonel was in that mix-up , and after it was over <name> <unk> was found dead in the bushes .
but it was a fair fight , and the desperadoes knew what to expect when they went in for it . "
" when does the quartermaster expect to come through with the money ? "
" i do n't know , <name> .
like as not it <name> be soon .
and that being the case , we had better not lose time here , but get to the fort just as soon as we can , " concluded the old scout .
chapter <name> .
darry makes a discovery .
as pressed as they were for time , darry and <name> begged that the <unk> be saved , and did all they could toward helping the old scout skin the beast .
with the pelt they took along about twenty pounds of the <unk> steaks .
" it 's a pity to leave the rest to the wolves ! "
sighed <name> .
" but it can't be helped .
what a feast they <name> have ! "
" i 'm going to sling the beast into a tree , " replied old benson .
" that may help save it until somebody else comes this way .
the soldiers from the fort use the trail yonder , you know . "
soon they were on the way to where benson and darry had left <unk> horse .
as <name> was tired from his night 's adventure , his cousin and the old scout took turns in carrying him behind them .
even then his eyes would occasionally close .
" we ca n't make the fort to-night , that 's certain , " said the old scout .
" not if we pushed on hard ? "
asked darry .
" <name> ca n't push on as fast as that , darry .
he 'll want to rest as soon as sundown comes . "
" perhaps i can get a nap at noon , while you two get dinner ready , " suggested <name> .
" i wonder if we 'll meet those rascals anywhere on the road ?
i <name> not , for they 'd be certain to recognize me . "
" we 'll keep an eye open for 'em , " responded benson dryly .
" and see to it that your <unk> are ready for use . "
" why  do you think they 'd attack us ? "
asked darry quickly .
" they might  if they thought we were carrying anything of value .
to such desperadoes all are fish that swim near their net . "
" it 's a pity the government ca n't stamp such a gang out , benson . "
" the government has stamped out lots of 'em , lad .
why , ten years ago none of these trails was safe .
nearly every horseman and stage-coach was held up .
to-day you do n't hear of a <unk> once in six months . "
" is this gilroy a very bad man ? "
" he is  in a way .
he 's a well-educated fellow , so i 've been told , and not as brutal as some .
but he 's committed some robberies that have no equal in the history of these parts .
once he painted himself as an indian and went to the agency , and there collected a lot of money which was coming to the redskins , the agent taking him for chief <unk> of the <unk> .
the trick was n't discovered until three days later , when the real <unk> turned up .
even then it was n't known who did the trick . "
" and how was gilroy found out ? "
" a fellow named <unk> , who belonged to the gang , was captured , and he gave the secret away .
but it cost <unk> his life , for he got away from the soldiers , and while he was in the mountains some of his gang shot and killed him . "
at this story both <name> and darry shuddered .
" what a lawless set ! "
muttered <name> .
" one could hardly believe it unless he saw it with his own eyes . "
" in a rough country the men are bound to be more or less rough , lad .
look at california , for instance .
to-day it 's as quiet and orderly as massachusetts or illinois .
but in the days of <unk> it was n't that way .
many a miner was held up for his gold dust , and many a miner 's secret of a <name> find was stolen from him and the miner himself murdered . "
" and how long do you think it <name> take to make this territory perfectly safe ? "
" there aint no telling about that , but probably when you are as old as i am now you 'll be able to travel anywhere without fear of being stopped .
the railroads are a-coming in , towns are building up , and one of these days the desperadoes and stage-coach robbers <name> all be a thing of the past  and a good job done . "
the third horse had been found , and now <name> was riding in his own saddle .
the rain of the night before had made the trail <unk> , and the air was as pure and sweet as one could wish .
by noon they calculated that they had covered ten miles of the worst portion of the distance to the fort .
the ride had been a strain to <name> , and when old benson called a halt he was glad enough to slip to the ground and throw himself in the shade of a tree to rest .
darry and the old scout lit a fire , and soon had a nice steak preparing for dinner .
" he 's asleep , " said darry , a little later , pointing to <name> .
" poor fellow !
supposing we let him rest for a couple of hours ?
i have n't the heart to wake him up . "
" all right , " answered benson .
the pair ate their dinner without arousing <name> , and after it was over the scout sat down near at hand to smoke his stumpy <unk> pipe , filling it with <unk> which was as black as coal , and puffing away with keen satisfaction .
darry was more restless , and having put away the things used in preparing the meal he began an inspection of the neighborhood .
" be careful , " said old benson , as the youth moved around .
" do n't get into trouble , as <name> did . "
" i 'll keep my eyes open , " replied darry .
opposite the trail was a tall spur of rocks with something of a series of natural steps leading to the top .
up these steps went the youth .
some of the climbing was difficult , but this he did not mind .
when the top was gained a magnificent panorama was spread out before him .
to one side were the tall mountains , hidden in a bluish mist , to the other the vast forests and plains .
northward was the continuation of the gap they were traveling , and southward was a series of foothills , with here and there a stream or waterfall glinting brightly in the <name> .
" how grand ! "
he murmured .
" what a vast country this is !
thousands upon thousands of people could live here , and nobody be crowded .
this would make splendid pasture for cows and sheep , and yet there is n't a single animal in sight . "
beyond the <name> spur was a similar elevation , and presently darry crossed to this .
here there was a lone pine with several low branches , and he <name> himself up and climbed to the top .
he could now see much further than formerly , and his view took in a portion of the trail passed several hours before , as it wound , <unk> , between the foothills .
" hullo ! "
he cried , as he caught sight of something moving on the trail .
" three people on horseback .
can they be the desperadoes <name> met ? "
he watched the riders with interest , and at last felt certain they were three men fully armed and wearing slouch hats and <unk> coats .
this description <unk> with that given by his cousin , and he hastened down to acquaint old benson with the news .
" must be the gang , " said the scout .
" are they moving this way ? "
" yes . "
" then we had better move on . "
<name> was awakened , and leaped to his feet , looking rather bewildered .
" i  i thought i 'd take a little nap , " he stammered .
" i suppose i've slept a good while , have n't i ? "
" about an hour and a half , " answered his cousin .
" here 's your dinner , " and he passed it over .
" we 've got to move on .
those rascals are behind us . "
" behind us ! "
" do n't get scared , " put in old benson .
" they are a good distance back .
darry discovered 'em from yonder p'int .
eat what you want , and then it <name> be time enough to start . "
the repast was quickly disposed of by <name> , and soon they were in the saddle once more .
the long nap had refreshed the lad greatly , and he said he would now be able to ride as far as anybody .
on they went , the trail growing more difficult as the top of the mountain was gained .
here there was a stiff breeze that at times was positively cold , and both boys were glad enough to button their jackets tightly around them .
if all went well benson calculated that they could reach <name> <unk> place with ease before dark .
this was the cabin of an old <name> and trapper who was known from one end of the territory to the other .
as mentioned at the beginning of this tale , leeson 's place was twenty miles from the fort .
" i could ride right through , " said the old scout .
" but you boys couldn't do it .
if you tried it , you 'd be so sore and stiff the next day you could n't stand up . "
chapter vii .
at <name> leeson 's cabin .
at first the boys were inclined to think that the old scout was mistaken  that they could ride as far as anybody .
but when , shortly after sunset , they came within sight of <name> leeson 's place both were glad to think that they would have to ride no more for the present .
" i 'm sore already , " whispered darry to his cousin .
" so am i  but i did n't want benson to know it , " was the low answer .
" that last mile of the trail was awfully rough . "
<name> leeson had seen them coming , and stood at the doorway of his cabin , rifle in hand .
he was a tall , thin man , with black eyes that were exceedingly sharp and shrewd .
when he recognized <name> benson he dropped his firearm into a corner and ran to meet the scout .
" downright glad ter see ye ! "
he said , shaking hands .
" <name> , <name> a sight fer sore eyes , thet 's wot ! "
" and i 'm glad to see you , <name> , " responded benson , just as warmly .
" how have things been with you ? "
" putty slow , to tell the truth . "
leeson looked at the boys .
" two <unk> along , i see . "
" yes .
this is <name> moore , brother to the captain up at the fort , and this is darry germain , his cousin .
boys , this is <name> leeson , the best trapper and <unk> shot in these parts . "
" oh , come , do n't be <unk> ' me so much ! "
cried leeson , as he took the boys ' hands in a grip that made them wince .
" as fer shootin ' , ye kin do thet yerself as good as anybody , <name> . "
he looked the boys over .
" glad to know ye , lads .
i know captain moore downright well , and he 's a good soldier . "
" i 've got news , <name> , " put in the old scout .
" <name> fell in with <name> gilroy 's gang down near <unk> run . "
" what ! "
roared the old trapper .
" do you mean to tell me thet measly crowd is around here ag'in ? "
" three of 'em are  gilroy , fetter , and a young fellow named potts .
i think potts comes from <name> . "
" i know him .
his father was <name> potts , the <unk> .
thet blood is about as bad as any in the gang .
what are they up to ? "
" they are laying a trap for the quartermaster when he comes through with the soldiers ' money .
<name> heard part of their talk by accident .
do you know when the quartermaster is expected ? "
" i do not .
ye see , ever since old cap'n <unk> was held up the army officers keep mum about the movements of the <unk> .
i reckon they have orders from washington to do it . "
" i want to warn colonel fairfield as soon as i can , " went on the old scout .
" yes , he ought to be warned . "
" can you lend me a fresh hoss ? "
" i can . "
" then i 'll be off as soon as i 've had a bit of supper .
the boys can stay with you all night , ca n't they ? "
" they can , an ' welcome , " replied <name> leeson .
" you are going to leave us ? "
queried <name> .
" do n't see any other way to do , lad .
the sooner i get the news to the fort the better .
i 'll come back in the morning after you  or send your brother or somebody else . "
" we can ride it alone , ca n't we ? "
questioned darry .
" i would n't try it , if i were you .
the trail is a rough one , and there are several forks where you might go astray . "
" better stay with me , lads , " put in leeson .
" i 'll treat ye well , never fear , " and he smiled broadly .
" thank you , " returned <name> .
" i was only thinking i 'd like to see my brother soon , that 's all . "
" a few hours more or less wo n't make much difference , " said darry .
he had looked around the trapper 's cabin , and was interested .
" let us wait . "
and so it was arranged .
it did not take long to get a bit of supper , and in less than half an hour <name> benson was off , astride of a powerful steed which had been <name> leeson 's pride for years .
" jest tell him to go to the fort , " said leeson , " and he 'll <name> ye thar with his eyes shet , " and he gave a parting salute to the old scout .
the cabin was a primitive affair of rough logs , with the chinks filled with dried <name> .
it contained two rooms , each about twelve feet square .
back of the cabin was a lean-to where leeson kept his horses , two in number .
there was room for more animals , so the beasts ridden by our friends were easily accommodated .
night had fallen by the time the horses had been rubbed down and fed and the boys had finished their evening repast , and it was dark when they gathered around the doorstep to rest .
<name> leeson sat on a <unk> , cleaning his rifle and smoking at the same time , and as the three rested <name> told of his adventure in the cave , and darry took up the tale of the bear .
" you had a lucky escape , lad , " said the trapper .
" a lucky escape , an ' no error .
like as not them desperadoes would have killed ye , had they caught ye . "
" i 've been thinking  do you imagine they 'll come here to-night ? "
asked darry .
<name> leeson shook his head .
" do n't allow as they <name> .
about a year ago i gave thet fetter fair warnin ' if he showed his face about my cabin i 'd plug him full o ' holes , an ' i sent gilroy the same message .
they know me , an ' know i wo n't stand any nonsense .
they 'll be likely to give me a wide berth .
they know i aint got much worth stealin ' . "
" then we ought to be safe until the soldiers get the news . "
" reckon you <name> be , lad , " answered the trapper .
he was very much of a quaint character , and for two hours the boys sat up , listening to his tales of encounters with wild animals , desperadoes , and indians .
" i 've had my own little fun with <unk> , " he said .
" got in a tree onct , and a b'ar kept me there fer a whole day .
i had wounded him in the leg , and in running over a <name> i dropped my gun . "
" how did you get away ? "
asked darry .
" i did n't know what to do fust .
the b'ar had me foul , and kept right at the bottom of the tree all the time .
with his wounded leg he couldn't come up , and i did n't dare to go down , and there we was  <unk> ' at each other , he <unk> ' and i <unk> ' all kind o ' unpleasant things about him . "
" did n't you have a pistol ? "
" no , all i had with me at the time was a <unk> , a <unk> , and my pocket-knife .
what to do i did n't know , and i was <unk> ' i 'd be starved out , when a thought struck me to blow him up with powder . "
" blow him up ! "
cried both boys .
" thet 's wot , lads  blow him up .
i had a handkerchief , ye see , an ' into this i dumped 'bout half my powder , an ' into the powder i put three matches , with the ends pointing out .
then i tied powder an ' matches into a hard lump and watched my chance .
there was a flat rock near the roots of the tree , and putty soon mr. b'ar squatted on this rock .
then i let drive fer the rock , an ' the powder an ' matches landed good an ' hard , i can tell ye . "
" and exploded ? "
put in <name> eagerly .
" yes , exploded with a noise ye could hear 'most a mile , i <unk> .
the powder flashed straight up into thet <unk> 's face , <unk> ' him and tearing his jaw half off , and the way he ran to save himself was a caution .
as soon as he was gone i dropped down and ran for my gun .
then i made after the b'ar and caught him between the rocks and finished him . "
this was the last story told that night , and soon after the tale was concluded leeson showed the boys into the inner room of the cabin , where there was something of a rough bed with a straw mattress .
" make <unk> ter hum , " he said .
" it aint no hotel , but it 's the best i 've got to offer ye . "
" but we do n't want to turn you out , " said darry .
" i 'll make myself comfortable near the door , " answered leeson .
" i want to sleep with one eye open  in case those rascals should take a notion to come this way . "
the boys were glad enough to rest indoors again and take off the clothing they had worn during the storm .
" camping out is well enough , " declared <name> ; " but i do n't want too much of it . "
" oh , we 've seen the worst side of it , " returned darry .
" i expect lots of good times when we get to the fort . "
" oh , so do i , for the matter of that . "
after turning in it did not take long for the cousins to get to sleep , and a little while later <name> leeson also threw himself down to rest .
but the old trapper remained close to the doorstep , and slept with his rifle near at hand .
an hour went by , and the darkness and silence continued .
there was no moon , and only a few stars were visible .
at a distance a few night birds were calling , and occasionally the howl of some lonely wolf could be heard , but that was all .
at last from out of the darkness of the trail came three men on foot .
they were <name> gilroy and his companions .
they had tethered their horses in the bushes some distance away .
they stole toward the cabin like so many grim and silent shadows .
chapter viii .
the stealing of the horses .
" go slow , men , " came softly from gilroy .
" you know what kind of a man leeson is . "
" reckon i do know , " came in a growl from fetter .
" and i 've got an account to settle with him , too . "
" i 'm pretty certain the boy is here , " went on the leader .
" but we must make sure if the others are here too , or if they have ridden off to the fort .
if they have gone to the fort   " " hist ! "
came in warning from potts .
" you 're talking too much .
i 've heard that this leeson sleeps with his ears wide open . "
" he does , " grumbled fetter ; and then the three desperadoes relapsed into silence .
they were advancing upon the cabin from the rear , and each held a ready pistol in his hand , while his rifle was slung over his back .
they had seen the boys and benson head for the trapper 's home while it was still light and they were on a high <name> ; but darkness had closed in on the scene , and they had come up to the spot in ignorance of what had followed .
tiptoeing their way they reached the lean-to where the horses had been <unk> , and with caution gilroy went inside .
by feeling the animals he soon learned that three had been in use but a few hours before , while the fourth was cool and comfortable .
" their horses are here , " he announced .
" and a fourth is here , too . "
" that 's leeson 's , " answered fetter .
" but i thought he had two or three . "
" might as well take them while we have the chance , " murmured potts .
" four <unk> <name> bring some money over at <unk> .
we can get <unk> to sell 'em . "
" let them out , " answered gilroy .
" without horses they 'll have their hands full trying to follow us . "
it was no easy task to untie the horses in a place that was pitch-dark , and it took some time to get even the horses belonging to our friends released .
as fetter and potts took the animals out , gilroy worked to untie the sturdy mare belonging to <name> leeson .
this was a pet animal , and not used to strangers .
as gilroy caught hold of the halter she gave a <unk> of suspicion .
" hush ! "
murmured the desperado , and ran his hand down the mare 's nose .
but this made her <unk> , and she stamped sharply half a dozen times .
" what 's up thar ? "
came in <name> leeson 's voice , and the trapper was wide awake on the instant .
" whoa , <name> , whoa ! "
" <name> the luck ! "
muttered gilroy , and ran outside after fetter and potts .
" he must have been on the watch . "
" we must get out ! "
responded fetter .
" he 's a <unk> , remember .
nothing but the darkness can save us . "
" i 'm going ! "
came from potts , and he leaped on the back of one of the horses  that which <name> had been riding .
" i 'm with you , " said fetter , and mounted old benson 's steed .
" come , <name> , and be quick about it . "
by this time <name> leeson was running around the corner of the cabin , gun in hand .
his call had aroused <name> and darry , and they were pulling on their clothing with all speed .
" something is wrong ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" it must be those desperadoes , " responded his cousin .
the boys were not yet dressed , when they heard a clatter of hoofs and a shot , followed by another .
then they came out , rifles in hand , to find leeson reloading near the stable .
" those desperadoes have been here ! "
exclaimed the old trapper .
" they ran off with your hosses , <unk> 'em ! "
" went off with the horses ? "
repeated darry .
" did you shoot at them ? "
" i did , but the light 's against me , and i do n't reckon as how i hit anything . "
<name> leeson meditated for a moment .
" i 've half a mind ter do it  yes , i have ! "
he muttered .
" do what ? "
asked <name> .
" go after 'em on my mare .
would you be afraid to stay here alone if i went ? "
" no ; go ahead ! "
cried both boys .
" we 'll keep watch while you are away , " continued <name> .
" if you can get the horses back it <name> be a great favor , " said darry .
" the three are worth over five hundred dollars . "
without further words , <name> leeson dashed into the stable , untied his mare and mounted her .
rifle over shoulder and pistol in hand , he dashed away on the back trail , whence the desperadoes had disappeared .
soon he was swallowed up in the darkness , although they heard the <unk> of <name> for several minutes after .
" this is the worst yet , " was <name> 's comment , when they were alone .
" those fellows are as daring as they are rascally .
i never dreamed they would come up in that fashion .
i wonder what they would have done if leeson had n't woke up ? "
" perhaps we would all have been murdered , " answered his cousin with a shudder .
" what shall we do , now we are dressed ? "
" that depends upon how long leeson remains away .
i move we remain on guard  one at the front of the cabin and the other at the rear .
if we keep our eyes peeled they ca n't come very close , even though it is dark . "
" all right , <name> .
keep your rifle handy . "
" do n't fear about that , darry . "
they were soon on guard , the one on the doorstep and the other near the lean-to , on a stump .
thus an hour dragged by .
to both it was an unusually long while .
" i do n't see a thing , " said darry , coming to where his cousin rested .
" nor i , and i 'm getting sleepy .
i hardly think leeson <name> be back until morning . "
" just what i was thinking .
let us take turns at watching .
the one on duty can walk around the cabin now and then , and that <name> give each of us some sleep . "
this was agreed upon , and they tossed up to see who should go on guard first .
it fell to darry 's lot , and <name> , hardly able to keep his eyes open , quickly retired , without undressing .
darry 's vigil was certainly a lonely one , doubly so because it was new to him .
as he tramped slowly around the cabin , he could not help but contrast this situation with the one he was used to at home .
" i do n't know as i 'd like to be a night policeman or a <unk> , " he reasoned .
" they must be awfully tiresome jobs .
and the city isn't near as lonely as this , either , even in the middle of the night . "
he <name> a long breath and looked at his watch .
" gracious , only three-quarters of an hour gone , and i 've got an hour and a quarter still to serve !
how awfully slow it is !
if leeson   what 's that ? "
he broke off short and came to a halt , with his rifle in his hands and his gaze fixed on some brushwood a hundred feet to the rear of the stable .
he had seen some dark object moving , but whether it was man or beast he could not tell .
" it was something , i 'm sure of that , " he told himself , after the object had disappeared from view .
" if it was a man he must have been crawling on hands and knees . "
he wondered if he had better awaken <name> , but hesitated , knowing how sleepy his cousin was .
perhaps the object would go away  if it was a wild beast .
keeping his eyes on the spot , darry waited what seemed to him a long time , but which was really but a few minutes .
then slowly the bushes parted and the object came forth , with eyes that gleamed fitfully even in that darkness .
" a mountain wolf ! "
muttered the boy .
" well , i 'm glad it is n't one of those desperadoes . "
taking up a stone he hurled it at the wolf , at the same time shouting to the beast to go away .
at once the wolf turned tail and disappeared whence it had come .
" did you call ? "
came sleepily from <name> .
" there 's a wolf in the bushes back of the cabin , " returned darry .
" does he want to attack you ? "
" i do n't know .
i just threw a stone at him , and he 's slunk out of sight . "
by this time <name> was also outside , and the two cousins waited for the reappearance of the wolf .
but the animal was cowardly , and did not show himself again , and presently <name> returned to bed .
the remainder of the night passed without anything unusual happening .
chapter ix .
arrival at the fort .
the morning found the two boys still alone .
the sun was well up over the eastern prairie before both were dressed , for they had taken turns at guarding , as agreed , and each had consequently lost half his regular sleeping time .
" well , what 's to do now ? "
questioned darry , while they were stirring around getting breakfast .
" i do n't know of anything to do but to wait here until we hear from benson and <name> leeson , " answered his cousin .
breakfast was soon disposed of , and then they sat down to wait , still keeping their firearms close to hand , in case of unexpected attack .
the meeting with the desperadoes had opened the boys ' eyes , and they did not intend to be caught " napping " no matter what else happened .
shortly before ten o'clock <name> espied three horsemen coming down the trail which led to the fort .
both watched the approaching riders with interest , and presently saw that they were soldiers .
one wore the uniform of a lieutenant , and the others were privates .
" you are from the fort ? "
cried <name> , running forward to meet them .
" yes , " was the answer from the lieutenant .
" which of you is <name> moore ? "
" i am . "
" i am glad to know you , moore .
your brother , the captain , and i are great friends .
i am lieutenant <name> <name> . "
" oh , i 've heard of you , " answered <name> , smiling .
" <name> has often mentioned his chum , <name> <name> , in his letters .
this is my cousin , darry germain .
did old benson reach the fort last night ? "
" he did , " answered lieutenant <name> , as he shook hands with both boys .
" and your brother and a detachment of company a have gone out to look for <name> gilroy and his gang .
benson went with them , and i was asked to come down here and escort you to the fort . "
" if my brother wants to round up gilroy 's gang he should have come here , " said <name> .
" the rascals were here last night and stole our three horses . "
" is it possible !
and where is <name> leeson ? "
" he went after them on his horse , the only one they did n't get .
we are looking for his return at any moment .
we promised to watch the cabin until he got back . "
" i see . "
the lieutenant turned to the privates .
" men , you may dismount and tie up the horses for the present .
we wo n't be going back just yet . "
lieutenant <name> leaped to the ground , and one of the privates took charge of his steed .
the young officer was a handsome fellow , with a smiling face , and both <name> and darry took to him at once .
" yes , captain moore and i are great friends , " he said .
" you see , we went through west point together , and we have been more or less together ever since .
he has often told me about you two fellows , so i feel as if i've known you for a long while . "
he looked at <name> .
" you must have had quite an adventure with those desperadoes at the cave . "
" i did have , " answered <name> .
" i <name> my brother and the others round them up .
do you know if they came anywhere near here ? "
" no , they struck off on another trail  the one the quartermaster is expected to use .
you see , he is to come in to-morrow with that money . "
" to-morrow !
then they 'll have time to warn him . "
" that depends upon circumstances .
the quartermaster is an odd sort of a fellow , and sometimes changes his mind about routes .
he may come in the way we expect , and he may take some entirely different trail . "
" we ca n't say when leeson <name> be back , " put in darry .
" but it seems to me it is our duty to stay here until he returns ; do n't you think so , <name> ? "
" i do , darry .
but he <name> probably be back before long . "
it was only a few minutes later when one of the privates came forward with the information that a man was coming through the underbrush skirting the timber .
it was <name> leeson , and he held his mare to a walk , for <name> was all but exhausted .
" mornin ' , lieutenant ! "
he called out , as he <name> closer and saluted .
" come for them boys , i reckon . "
" i did , leeson .
they tell me you 've been after the gang .
what luck ? "
<name> leeson shook his head dubiously .
" reckon i did n't have any luck , lieutenant .
got one shot , but if i hit it did n't count much .
they had the best o ' me in the timber , and they got away , not only with the hosses belonging to the boys an ' benson , but likewise with their own , which they had tethered in a hollow not far away . "
" then our horses are gone ! "
cried darry , his face falling .
" thet 's it , lad .
i 'm sorry , but i did my best . "
" oh , i do n't blame you , leeson .
but  but if we have n't any horses , how are we to get to the fort ? "
" we 'll take turns at carrying you , " replied lieutenant <name> .
<name> leeson was as worn out as his mare , and while one of the soldiers cared for <name> the old trapper sank down on his doorstep and told his story .
he had followed the desperadoes up hill and down for fifteen miles , and gotten one shot at fetter , which , he believed , had struck the rascal in the arm .
but the party had turned on the trail while passing through a wide patch of <unk> , and on coming out at the other side he had been unable to locate them again .
then , as it was almost morning , he had thought best to return to his cabin , to ascertain how the boys were faring .
" which road were they near when you saw them last ? "
asked lieutenant <name> .
" over at <unk> 's rock , " answered leeson .
" moving toward the knob . "
" humph !
then i am afraid captain moore wo n't round them up very quickly . "
" my brother did n't go near that trail ? "
questioned <name> .
" no , he 's on a trail three miles further north .
still , the desperadoes may turn north . "
" that 's so , " said leeson .
as there was nothing to keep them at the cabin , the boys were now anxious to move on to the fort , and a short while later lieutenant <name> set off .
one private carried <name> and the other darry ; and , as the horses were powerful beasts , good progress was made .
" hurrah !
the fort ! "
cried <name> , as he caught sight of a large flag waving in the distance .
he was right ; and soon they could see the tall stockade quite plainly .
it was three hundred feet long by two hundred feet wide , and surrounded by a ditch twelve feet deep .
inside of the stockade were the fort proper and a dozen other buildings , including the <unk> quarters , the men 's quarters , the <unk> , hospital , and the gymnasium , and also a good-sized stable .
" why , it 's a regular town in itself ! "
murmured darry , when they got inside .
" that 's right , a town of exactly two hundred and seventy-five people , " answered the lieutenant .
" and of that number two hundred and sixty are soldiers belonging to three companies , three are officers ' wives , two are indian scouts , and the rest are cooks and other helpers . "
colonel fairfield , a tall , dignified old officer , had been told of their approach , and now came from the officers ' quarters to meet them .
" i am glad to see you , boys , " he said , as he shook hands warmly .
" if the story benson told is true you have had quite a few adventures in reaching here .
i am sorry your brother is not here to meet you , <name> ; but he was anxious to go after the gilroy gang , and i let him have his way . "
" you have n't heard about all of our adventures , colonel , " said darry , and told of the stolen horses .
" worse and worse ! "
returned the colonel , stroking his mustache thoughtfully .
" that proves that the gang  or what is left of it  is as desperate as ever .
those fellows <name> never give up until they are either arrested or shot down . "
" i <name> my brother does n't get into trouble with them , " said <name> anxiously .
" well , a soldier has to take some risks , my boy .
but captain moore is as shrewd as he is brave , so you need not fear for his safety .
come right in ; mrs. fairfield <name> be glad to see you .
she wants to hear from all the folks at home . "
the boys followed the old officer into the quarters , and here received an equally warm greeting from mrs. fairfield , whom they had met in chicago .
dinner was soon served , and while the lads were satisfying the inner man they had to tell their whole story over again , and also tell all the news from home .
" while you are here , boys , you must make yourselves perfectly at ease , " said the colonel .
" i know your fathers <name> expect me to be a father to you .
as for captain moore , i <name> allow him to be with you as much as military discipline permits . "
chapter x .
the result of a swim .
to the boys , who had never visited a military quarters before , the fort proved of great interest , and they were glad , after the meal was over , to have lieutenant <name> take them around .
this occupied some time , and when they had finished it was time for the evening parade .
this was quite an affair , and the two lads joined the ladies of the place to witness it .
everybody turned out , in uniform as clean as possible , on inspection .
the drums rolled , the <unk> struck up a lively air , and the three companies , headed by a <name> , marched around the stockade several times and then to the parade-ground in front of the gates .
here the command went through the <name> of arms and through a number of fancy evolutions .
" it 's splendid ! "
murmured <name> .
" everything moves like clockwork . "
" it makes me almost wish to be a soldier , " answered darry .
" but if a fellow had this day in and day out i am afraid he would grow tired of it . "
" you are right , darry , " said mrs. fairfield .
" the colonel has to think up a great number of things whereby to interest his men .
they get up all sorts of contests , and <unk> and theatricals , and go hunting when they can get the chance  anything to keep them from growing too dull . "
" have they had any real military duty to do lately ? "
asked <name> .
" not for over a year .
then the <unk> indians got up a <unk> , and they had to march over to <unk> and stop it .
two indians were killed and one soldier was badly wounded .
since that time the indians have been quiet . "
" but the indians may rise again . "
" probably they <name>  one is never sure of them .
as one old general has said , 'the only safe indian is the dead indian . ' "
the boys were assigned to a small room next to that occupied by captain moore and lieutenant <name> .
the apartment was neatly furnished with iron cots , an iron washstand , and a small wardrobe for extra clothing .
fortunately the extra clothing they had carried had not been stolen , so they were not as bad off as they would otherwise have been .
<name> was anxious to hear from his brother <name> , but had to be patient .
yet he was not greatly worried , for he was almost certain that the soldiers would fail to fall in with the desperadoes , each having taken a different trail .
the day following their arrival the boys fell in with several soldiers who were going fishing up a mountain stream not far away , having obtained special leave of absence for that purpose .
the soldiers , who were named <unk> , ferry , and lambert , were glad enough to have the boys for company .
" we 'll show you some good sport , " said lambert , who proved to be something of a leader .
" no better fish in these parts than those you can catch in <name> pass river . "
the boys had no <unk> , but lieutenant <name> fitted them out , and soon the party was on the way .
the soldiers were to be gone but four hours , and so struck out at a gait that taxed <name> and darry to the utmost to keep up with them .
" it 's the air does it , " explained <unk> , when darry spoke about the speed .
" after you 've been out here a while you 'll eat like a horse and feel like walking ten miles every morning before breakfast .
i tell you , the air is wonderful . "
" it certainly is bracing , " answered darry .
" i noticed that as soon as we began to climb the foothills . "
a walk of half an hour brought them to <name> pass river , and they journeyed along the bank until they came to a favorite <unk> .
" here we are , " said lambert .
" now for the first fish ! "
" ten cents to whoever catches it ! "
cried <name> , and placed a shining dime on a nearby tree stump .
at this the three soldiers laughed .
" that dime is mine , " declared ferry , who was the first to throw in .
" perhaps , " answered <unk> .
" but i reckon i 've got just as good a chance now . "
" here i come , " put in lambert , and threw over his friends ' heads .
hardly had his bait gone down than he felt a tug and whipped in a little fish not over six inches long .
" mine ! "
he cried .
" it is n't worth ten cents ! "
cried <unk> and ferry ; nevertheless lambert pocketed the coin , amid a general laughing .
the boys now went to a spot a little above where the soldiers were fishing , and set to work on their own lines .
just as ferry announced a fine haul , they threw in , and soon everybody in the party was busy , bringing in several kinds of fish , big and little , including some fine trout of a variety the boys had not before seen .
inside of an hour everybody had all the fish he wanted , and then the soldiers said they were going to take a swim .
the boys were willing , and soon the whole crowd were in the water , calling out and laughing and having a good time generally .
" do n't go too far down the stream , " cautioned lambert .
" the falls are below , and you might get caught in the rapids . "
" all right , we 'll surely remember , " answered <name> .
" i 'll race you across the river and back , " said darry , a little later .
" done ! "
cried <name> .
" to what point ? "
" to that <name> hanging down near the big rock . "
so it was agreed , and in a minute both boys were off .
they were good swimmers , and the race interested the soldiers , so that they gave up sporting around to watch the result .
at this point the stream widened out to nearly two hundred feet , so the race was not a particularly short one .
the water ran quite swiftly , and they soon found they had to swim partly up stream to prevent being carried below the <name> .
darry made the <name> first , and , touching the <name> , started on the return .
<name> was close behind , and now it became a <unk> race between them .
" go it , boys ! "
shouted lambert .
" do your best ! "
" i bet on <name> , " said ferry .
" i bet on darry , " added <unk> .
hardly had the wager been made when <name> shot ahead .
slowly but surely he <name> away from his cousin .
while the sport was going on nobody had noticed a large tree that was drifting rapidly down the middle of the river .
now , however , lambert saw the danger .
" look out ! "
he cried wildly .
" look out !
a tree is coming down upon you ! "
<name> heard the cry , and looking up the stream managed to get out of the way of the big piece of driftwood .
but darry was not so fortunate , and in a twinkling the youth was struck and carried out of sight .
this accident came so quickly that for the moment nobody knew what to do .
" darry !
darry ! "
cried <name> .
" where are you ? "
" he went under ! "
shouted lambert .
" the tree branches struck him on the head . "
" he 'll be drowned ! "
gasped <unk> .
" what shall we do ? "
by this time the tree had drifted past the point where the soldiers were stationed .
<name> had now struck bottom with his feet , and at once went ashore .
" we must do something ! "
he panted .
" we ca n't let darry be drowned ! "
" he must be caught under the branches , " said lambert .
" as the tree hit him it turned partly over .
perhaps   there is his foot ! "
he pointed to the tree  and there , sure enough , was darry 's left foot , kicking wildly above the surface of the river .
then the boy 's head came up , but only for a moment .
" save me ! "
he spluttered , and immediately disappeared .
" this is awful ! "
groaned <name> .
" ca n't we throw a <unk> over the tree and haul it ashore ? "
" a good idea ! "
answered lambert .
" we 'll take two lines . "
he caught up the <unk> , and lines in hand ran along the river bank until he was below the tree .
the others followed , and helped him to get the lines into shape .
then a quick cast was made , but the lines fell short .
" too bad ! "
came from <name> .
" quick , try once more ! "
" the tree is turning over again ! "
shouted <unk> , and he was right .
as some other branches came into view , they beheld darry , caught in a crotch and held there as if in a <unk> .
another cast was made , and then a third , but all in vain .
then the tree , with its helpless victim , moved forward more rapidly than ever , in the direction of the roaring falls , which were but a short distance off .
chapter xi .
something about drilling .
" darry is lost !
nothing can save him now ! "
such was the agonizing thought which rushed through <name> 's <name> as he watched the progress of the drifting tree as it moved swiftly toward the falls of <name> pass river .
he knew the falls to be over thirty feet high .
at the bottom was a boiling pool which sent up a continual shower of spray .
nobody entering that pool could survive .
darry , too , realized his peril , and continued to call for help .
had he been able to loosen himself he would have leaped into the water , but he was weak and helpless , and his voice could scarcely be heard above the rushing of the rapids .
<name> and the three soldiers continued to run along the river bank , over rough rocks that cut their feet and through bushes which scratched them in scores of places .
at last they came out on a point directly above the falls .
the tree still spun on , and <name> closed his eyes to shut out the sight of what was to follow .
suddenly lambert let out a shout : " the tree is caught !
it has stopped moving ! "
again <name> looked , and he saw that what the soldier said was true .
the under branches of the drifting tree had hit some sharp rocks below the river 's surface , and one branch had wedged itself fast .
this catching of the driftwood bent down the limb that held darry , and soon they saw that the <unk> boy was free from the grip which had held him .
but what to do next the lad did not know .
to swim to the shore was out of the question .
" i  i ca n't make it , " he told himself , as he panted for breath .
he was so exhausted that he felt very much like fainting away .
but he knew he must keep his senses , or all would be over with him .
" darry !
darry !
are you much hurt ? "
called out <name> .
" not much , but i  i ca n't  swim  ashore ! "
was the gasped out answer .
" i 'll try the fishing lines again , " said lambert , and prepared them once more .
a first cast did not reach darry , but a second did , and he caught the <unk> to the lines with a good deal of satisfaction .
" <name> they hold ? "
questioned <name> .
" i <name> so , " answered lambert .
" anyway , it 's the best we can do . "
letting the lines run out as far as possible , the soldiers and <name> moved up the bank of the stream to where there was a series of rocks projecting into the water a distance of several yards .
" now brace me , and i <name> haul in , " said lambert .
then he called to darry to help them by swimming as well as he was able , with the lines caught around him , under the arms .
" all right , i 'm ready ! "
cried the boy , and dropped into the stream , taking care to steer clear of the tree .
lambert hauled in slowly but steadily .
the line straightened out and became taut , and looked as if it might snap at any instant .
<name> 's heart came up into his throat , and he breathed a silent prayer that his cousin might be saved .
" here he comes ! "
muttered lambert at length , and they could see that darry 's feet at last rested on the <name> bottom of the river .
they continued to haul in , and soon he was safe .
when on shore he pitched himself on the grass , completely exhausted .
" oh , how glad i am ! "
cried <name> , as he knelt beside his cousin .
" i was almost certain you 'd be drowned ! "
" it was a narrow escape ! "
answered dairy , when he could speak .
" when the tree first struck me i was almost stunned , and when i realized what had happened i found myself fast and hardly able to budge .
just look there ! "
and he showed a deep scratch on one side of his body and a heavy red <name> on the other .
" but never mind , " he went on .
" i am thankful my life was spared ! "
it was a <unk> party that dressed and journeyed back to the fort , <name> carrying both his own fish and those his cousin had caught .
" i am afraid that <name> end fishing and swimming for a while , " said <unk> .
" the soldiers never go near the falls , for they all know the danger , but colonel fairfield is too strict to run any chances . "
" do n't say anything about the adventure on the tree , " said darry .
" <name> you keep mum ? "
" i <name> , and so <name> you , wo n't you , <name> ? "
" yes . "
so it was arranged that nothing should be said , that the <unk> little recreation might not be interfered with , for both boys saw that they had little pleasure at the best .
" a fine haul for you boys ! "
said lieutenant <name> , as he surveyed the catch .
" i must go myself and try my luck .
i have n't been fishing this summer . "
" it 's a splendid place for bites , " said <name> .
" i know it .
but you have to be careful up there .
there 's a nasty fall in the river .
if you went over that you 'd never come out alive . "
" yes , we saw the fall , " answered darry , and gave a shudder in spite of himself .
again at sunset there was a parade , similar to that of the day before .
after it was over the boys procured guns and had lambert put them through their " paces , " as he called it .
" first we 'll drill a bit without guns , " said the old soldier , for lambert had seen sixteen years of service .
" toe this line , heads up , chest out , and little fingers on the seams of your trousers .
that 's all right .
now then , eyes right !
when i say that turn your eyes to the right , but do n't move your faces .
now , eyes front !
that 's good .
eyes left !
eyes front !
that 's first-rate . "
" but we 're not moving , " said darry .
" now we 'll move .
watch me .
right face !
do you see how it 's done ?
balance on the heel , this way , and swing around .
now then , right face ! "
the two boys came around like <unk> old soldiers .
" good , boys , good .
now then , front face !
good .
left face !
that 's not so well .
front face !
now here 's another , about face ! "
so the drilling went on , until the boys could move as lambert wished them to .
then they began to march and to wheel right and left .
at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces , and then showed them the <name> of arms .
[ illustration : " at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces . " ]
" you 'll learn in no time , " said the old soldier , when his off time came to an end .
" you 've crowded a dozen lessons into one . "
" and i feel it , " said darry .
" i 'm going in to rest . "
and he went , followed by <name> .
all told , the boys had enjoyed the drill very much .
<name> was somewhat worried when bedtime came and still nothing had been heard of his brother .
yet colonel fairfield told him not to mind the prolonged absence .
" but should not your quartermaster be here ? "
asked the boy .
" he may come in to-morrow morning , " answered the colonel .
the next day dawned cloudy , and by noon a steady rain was falling .
the boys hardly knew what to do , and , after watching a drill and some performances in the gymnasium , went back to the living quarters .
they had hardly entered when there came a shout from the guard at the stockade .
" captain moore is coming , with the quartermaster ! "
was the cry .
" hurrah , it 's <name> ! "
shouted <name> , and ran out despite the rain to welcome his brother .
soon the soldiers came up , <unk> and tired .
they embraced half of company a , and in their midst was the quartermaster of the regiment , with two attendants .
each of these three carried heavy saddle-bags , filled with government money for the soldiers , for <unk> was now due .
" <name> ! "
cried captain moore , as he dismounted and caught his brother by the hand .
" i am glad to see you safe and sound . "
" and i am glad to see you , " answered <name> .
" i <name> be with you soon  i must first report to colonel fairfield , " went on the young officer , and lost no time in seeking the commandant .
his story was soon told , and it speedily spread to all parts of the fort .
along with his men and old benson he had looked in vain for the gilroy gang for a whole day .
then he had come upon them just as they were preparing for an attack upon the quartermaster and his escort .
the gang had numbered eight , and in the fight which had followed two of the crowd had been wounded , although all had made their escape by swimming their steeds over a dangerous mountain torrent .
of the soldiers three had been wounded , one man quite seriously .
the young captain had received a bullet through his hat .
" it was <name> gilroy himself who fired that shot , " said captain moore .
" and i wo n't forget it when next we meet . "
old benson had been in the thickest of the fight from beginning to end , and it was he who had wounded one of the desperadoes while the fellow was in the act of carrying off one of the <unk> .
the rascals had fought hard over that <unk> , but in the end had been compelled to drop everything and ride to save their lives .
as soon as captain moore had made his report , another detachment was sent out , to follow the desperadoes , if they could be found .
this detachment was fifty strong and under the leadership of lieutenant <name> .
the lieutenant was a man who had met numerous desperadoes in his time , and it was felt that he could do the work much better than the average soldier .
chapter xii .
deer hunting .
with his brother at hand , <name> felt much more at home than formerly , and the captain 's presence also made a difference to his cousin .
old benson remained at the fort for the time being , and did what he could to please the boys .
he took an especial interest in their shooting , and would often set up a target on the prairie for them to practice on .
" you 'll do first-rate in a little while , " he said .
" and as lambert says you take to drilling , it wo n't be long afore you 're both out-and-out soldiers . "
" i do n't know as i care to be a regular soldier , " answered darry .
" i would n't mind it for a while , but to enlist for five years  why , that's another thing . "
" lambert has enlisted four times .
when his time is out he 'll be in service twenty years . "
" and yet he is only a private , " put in <name> .
" he is content , and does n't want to go any higher .
he likes the life , and he told me not long ago that he would n't know what to do with himself if he was out of uncle <name> 's employ . "
one day after another passed , until the boys had been at the fort a little over a week .
they now knew the drills and the " <unk> " as well as anybody , and often practiced on the apparatus in the gymnasium .
" it 's not so bad , after you once get used to it , " said <name> .
" the men are a good deal of company for each other . "
" it 's odd to see so many men and so few women , " returned darry .
" some of the men do n't want any women around , so i 've been told .
they are like some of the old-time miners who used to move out of camp as soon as a <unk> showed itself . "
one day captain moore and old benson got permission to go off on a hunt , and took the boys along .
all of the party were mounted , and each carried a <unk> with part of the necessary camping outfit .
" if it 's possible to do so , i 'll show you some big game , " announced the old scout .
" although i 'll allow big game is mighty scarce , even in these parts . "
" have the hunters shot down everything ? "
asked <name> .
" a good bit , lad .
you see , many used to come out here just to shoot for the sake of killing .
i 've known a party of six men to kill twenty or thirty buffalo and then leave the carcasses to the wolves .
that was a shame . "
" so it was ! "
cried darry .
" one or two buffalo would have been enough . "
" some hunters never know when to stop , " put in captain moore .
" they shoot as long as anything shows itself .
if it was n't for that these hills would be filled with buffalo , deer , bears , and all other kind of game . "
the morning was clear and cool , and everybody in the party was in the best of spirits .
the course was down into a broad valley , in the middle of which flowed the <name> pass river , and then up a series of hills leading to <name> long mountain  a favorite resort in this territory for sportsmen .
" do you think we 'll see or hear anything of those desperadoes ? "
asked <name> of his brother , as they rode along side by side .
" it 's not likely , " answered the young captain .
" as soon as they learn that the soldiers are after them they 'll take to their heels in double-quick order .
they have n't any taste for meeting our regulars . "
" it 's queer that this <name> gilroy should go in for this sort of life  if he is as well educated as you say . "
" some men do n't like anything better , <name>  they would n't earn their living honestly if they could .
it 's queer that this is so , but it 's a fact .
those men have no regular homes , although many often talk of settling down .
generally they die with their boots on , as the saying goes . "
by noon the party had covered fifteen miles and were well into the hills .
they came to a rest beside a fine spring which flowed from a split in the rocks .
near at hand was some dense brushwood , and old benson rightfully guessed that it would not be difficult to beat up some birds .
" you can now try your luck at aiming , " he said to the boys , and led the way into the dense growth .
soon a flock of birds arose directly before them , and both darry and <name> took a quick shot , bringing down seven of the quarry .
then the scout fired , and five other birds dropped .
" pretty good for a starter ! "
cried old benson , as they stalked around picking up the game .
" that target practice has made you both pretty steady .
just a round dozen , all told .
that 's <unk> for dinner , i reckon . "
captain moore was also pleased when told of what his brother and his cousin had accomplished .
" you 'll make great hunters in time , " he said .
" the main thing is to keep your nerve when big game <unk> you .
you know you have the best of a bird or squirrel , or anything like that .
but when it comes to a buffalo , or a bear   " " i know all about bears , " interrupted <name> , and at this there was a general laugh .
" if i ever meet another bear i want to be well prepared for him , " he continued .
" generally a wild animal wo n't fight , " went on the young captain .
" but when one is cornered he is apt to get very ugly ; eh , benson ? "
" right you are , captain .
i was once cornered by a buffalo , and had all i could do to save myself . "
the old scout calculated that they would strike some game that afternoon , and he was not mistaken .
about two o'clock they sighted several deer far up the hillside .
" fine , plump animals , " said benson .
" if we get a couple of them we can be well satisfied . "
it was decided that they should move around in a semicircle , so as to get to leeward of the herd .
" if we do n't do that , the deer <name> scent us and be off in no time , " explained captain moore .
their horses were tethered in the brush , near some trees , and the party of four started out on foot .
the way was rough , but the boys did not mind this .
their sole thought was upon the deer , and each resolved to bring down one of the game , no matter at what cost .
it was no light task to reach a spot from which to shoot .
they had to cross several depressions on the hillside , and here the undergrowth was so heavy that progress at times seemed impossible .
once darry went into a hole up to his waist , and came out with several rents in his coat , where the thorns had clung to him .
" oh ! "
he muttered .
" oh ! "
" are you hurt ? "
questioned <name> quickly .
" not much , but i reckon i 'm a good deal scratched up , " answered darry , with a wry face .
at last they gained a point well to leeward of the quarry , and benson brought the party to a halt .
" we 'll creep in as far as we can , " he said .
" but keep your guns ready for use , and as soon as one fires the others had best fire too , for the deer wo n't wait after one shot .
which <name> you take , captain ? "
" i 'll take the one near the big rock , " answered captain moore .
" <name> , you had better take the one on the knoll . "
" i <name> . "
" i 'll take the one rubbing his side with his <unk> , " put in darry .
" and i 'll take the one coming through the brush , " finished old benson .
" now then , forward .
make no noise , and be sure your gun does n't go off and hit somebody else instead of the deer . "
rifles in hand , they crept through the underbrush and down toward the glade in which the deer were feeding .
the animals did not become suspicious until they were less than a hundred yards away .
then , of a sudden , the leader threw up his head and began to sniff the air .
" now fire , " said benson in a low tone .
at once the four rifles came up , and each <name> took steady aim .
darry and <name> fired at the same instant , and the young captain and benson discharged their pieces immediately after .
the aim of the two older hunters was true , and two deer fell dead after going less than six steps .
but the other game was only wounded , <unk> deer in the side and darry 's in the flank , and they bounded away up the hillside .
" missed ! "
groaned <name> , and slipped another cartridge into his firearm .
darry did the same , and both fired a second time .
then , seeing how badly the deer were wounded , they ran after the animals .
the course of the deer was straight for the timber down the mountain-side , and through the brush crashed quarry and boys until another hundred yards were covered .
then , coming to a <name> <name> , and being unable to leap to the top , the deer came to a halt .
" do you see 'em ? "
panted darry , almost out of breath with running .
" yes  there they are ! "
returned <name> .
" see ? "
" i do .
they ca n't get up the rocks .
<name> , we 've got 'em after all .
we must shoot   gracious ! "
the boy broke off short , and with good reason .
the deer had spotted them , and now without warning turned and ran straight for both , as if to gore them to death !
chapter xiii .
a fish and a snake .
" look out , darry , or he 'll kill you ! "
" look out for yourself , <name> ! "
these cries were followed by two shots , as both the young hunters discharged their weapons .
but in their haste the aim of each was poor , and the bullets flew wide of the <name> .
then the maddened deer came closer , and both boys took to their heels , running as they had never run before .
" hi !
what 's up ? "
came in old benson 's voice .
" the deer are after us ! "
yelled <name> .
" shoot 'em quick ! "
hardly had the lad spoken when he felt one of the deer close behind him .
he leaped to one side , and the animal charged past with great vigor , considering how badly he was wounded .
but that charge was his last , for benson 's rifle spoke up , and the animal fell lifeless where he stood .
in the meantime darry was having his hands full with the second deer .
the youth had been unable to reload , and now he found himself in a thicket , with the deer fairly on top of him .
he caught his firearm by the barrel and hit the animal a resounding blow on the head .
this made the deer stagger back and pause .
" help !
help ! "
yelled the boy .
" somebody shoot this beast ! "
" i 'm coming ! "
came in captain moore 's voice .
" where are you ? "
" here , in the bush !
quick , or he 'll stick me to death ! "
the deer was now charging with lowered head .
he was in a fearful rage .
as he came on there was a sharp report , and the young captain burst into view , his rifle barrel still smoking .
then the deer gave one last leap into the air , and came down upon darry .
the fall knocked the boy senseless .
while captain moore was removing the weight from darry 's body , the old scout came up , followed by <name> .
" hullo , he got it , did he ? "
said benson .
" is he badly hurt ? "
" i <name> not , " answered the young captain .
" you see , the deer didn't touch him until i fired .
then he leaped up and knocked my cousin down . "
" <name> there aint any bones broken . "
the deer was removed , and benson went off to get some water .
when he came back captain moore and <name> were rubbing darry 's wrists .
the water was dashed into the unconscious youth 's face , and soon he gave a gasp and opened his eyes .
" the deer ? "
were his first words .
" you are safe , " said the captain <unk> .
" the deer is dead . "
" oh ! "
darry uttered a sigh of relief .
" i was thinking he was <unk> me to pieces . "
" you had a narrow escape , " put in old benson .
" if it had n't been for the captain he would have mauled you for certain .
did n't you hear me yell to be careful ? "
" i thought it would be an easy matter to bring him down , after he was wounded , " said darry , still gasping for breath .
" any bones broken ? "
questioned captain moore .
" i  i guess not . "
darry gave a sigh and sat up .
" how did <name> make out ? "
" i am all right , " answered that individual .
" benson did the trick for me though .
benson , i owe you a good deal . "
" and i owe you a good deal , " said darry , turning to his cousin .
" i 'm glad i came up , darry , " answered the young captain .
" after this both you and <name> must be more careful .
if either of you had been killed i would never have forgiven myself for bringing you out on the hunt . "
" i want to give you both a bit of advice , and i want you to remember it too , " came from the old scout .
" never get too close to big game until you are certain of what you are doing , and be extry careful of big game that is wounded and cornered .
even a sneaking fox <name> turn on you if he sees there is no other way out of his difficulty . "
" i 'll remember that , " answered both <name> and darry , and they did remember , and thus was one peril of <unk> hunting abolished .
darry felt too weak for the time being to do much , so <name> led him back to where they had left the horses , while captain moore and old benson took upon themselves the task of bringing in the four deer .
each was a beautiful prize , and the <unk> made an imposing sight when <name> up on a couple of tree branches .
" the colonel <name> like this haul , " said the young captain .
" it <name> mean prime venison for some days to come .
benson , i wish we could get some of it back to the fort without delay  so we can put it on ice and keep it nice . "
" i 'll take 'em all to the fort to-night , if you say so , " answered the scout .
" i can take one on my horse , and load the other three on one of the other animals . "
" then do that , and while at the fort ask the colonel if he <name> give me permission to remain out until saturday .
tell him we think we can bring in something for all hands to enjoy . "
" i 'll do it , " said the old scout .
soon the deer were packed on the horses , old benson having first cut some steaks from the smallest of the game , to leave behind .
" take good care of yourselves while i am gone , " he said on departing .
" and you , <name> and darry , mind what i told you about getting cornered . "
then he was off , and a turn in the mountain trail soon hid him from view .
" a fine old fellow , " was <name> 's comment , when benson was gone .
" he is that , " answered the young captain .
" i liked him from the first time i saw him , and i have never had cause to regret it .
he is a good <name> , an excellent scout , and has done us many a good turn . "
" what shall we do while he is absent ? "
questioned darry .
" oh , we can try our hand at small game and we can fish ! "
answered the young captain .
" as it is , i reckon both of you would just as lief take it easy until morning . "
" i would .
that deer on me has made me feel sore all over . "
they were soon in camp again , and while the boys rested captain moore stirred around and showed them how the soldiers prepared their meals .
he cooked the steaks to a turn , and boiled a pot of coffee , and these , with some crackers they had brought along , made a most excellent meal .
being in no hurry , they took their time over the repast , and it was dark long before they finished .
" it 's going to be a fine night , so we can sleep under the trees without fear , " said the young captain .
" do n't you think some wild animals <name> attack us ? "
" not if we keep our camp-fire burning . "
the boys brought in plenty of brush and some heavier wood , and arranged it so that it would burn for a long while , doing this by forming the stuff into something of a circle .
then the horses were looked after , and each retired , with his blanket rolled around him to keep off the mountain dew , which was already showing itself .
when the boys awoke the sun was shining brightly into their faces .
for a moment each stared at the other .
" gracious , i never slept so soundly in my life ! "
cried <name> .
" i couldn't have done better in a bed at home . "
" nor i , " returned his cousin .
" i can tell you , sleeping in the open air when it does n't rain is all right . "
but when darry got up on his feet he changed his tune .
the fall of the day previous , combined with the night air , had made him <unk> stiff , and it was a good half-hour before he became <unk> up .
they found captain moore already stirring , and the kettle over the fire was boiling merrily .
the captain himself was trying his luck at a <name> not a great distance off .
" i saw some fish in here some weeks ago , " he explained .
" i thought i might get a couple for breakfast .
but you lads <name> have to wait until i strike luck . "
" i 'm willing to wait , " said <name> .
" there is nothing to do , is there , until benson gets back ? "
" nothing that i know of , unless you want to fish or go after some small game .
i want to hear what he has to say .
if the colonel wo n't let me stay out , i 'll have to return to the fort to-night . "
it did not take long for captain moore to land several good-sized specimens of the <unk> tribe , and these the boys took turns at preparing for eating , while the captain continued to fish .
the balance of the morning was passed at the <name> , and , strange to say , the captain and <name> were both quite successful , while darry hardly got a bite .
" i 'm going to try my luck further up the stream , " announced the boy .
" i believe we are all fishing too closely together . "
" that does n't seem to hurt my luck , " said <name> .
darry was soon climbing the rocks leading up the <name> .
the way was rough , but he was growing used to this life in the open air and he enjoyed even the hardship , if such it can be called .
" that ought to make a good <unk> , " he said to himself , as he reached a point where several big rocks <name> over the water 's edge .
" it 's dark down there , and that 's what some fish like . "
he prepared his bait with care , and then dropped his line into the hole .
almost immediately he felt a nibble , and , giving a jerk , found he had caught something that was both large and powerful .
" gracious , it must be a whopper ! "
he muttered , as the fish darted hither and thither .
then he braced back on the rock , to play the game , for bringing in the catch at once seemed out of the question .
the pole bent greatly , and he was afraid it would snap on him .
he could not stand on the slippery rock very well , and so stepped behind it , on a number of loose stones .
hardly had he done so when he heard a strange hissing .
looking down , he saw a snake glide from under the rock .
in a moment more the angry reptile faced him .
chapter xiv .
over the mountain top .
darry was much alarmed , and with good reason .
never before had he faced such a snake , and the reptile looked ready to spring upon him at any instant .
what to do the boy did not know , yet instinctively he leaped back to the top of the rock .
then the fish gave a jerk which almost took him from his feet .
" <name> !
<name> ! "
he shouted .
" come this way !
i 'm in a pickle ! "
" what 's the matter ? "
shouted captain moore , and soon he and his brother were coming forward as quickly as they could .
in the meantime darry was having his hands full , for the big fish was bound to get away .
at the bottom of the rock lay the snake , with head raised and mouth wide open .
its eyes shone like diamonds .
" a snake !
kill it ! "
shrieked darry .
" a snake ? "
echoed <name> .
" where ? "
" at the bottom of this big rock .
oh , my , he 's going to come up ! "
" i see him , " put in captain moore .
as he spoke the snake made a leap for the top of the rock .
as the reptile went up , darry went down , and ran along the <name> 's edge , still with his <unk> in his hand .
catching up a sharp stone , captain moore flung it at the snake , hitting the reptile in the tail .
at once the thing whirled around , and now forgetting darry it turned on its assailant .
" he 's coming for you ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" run , <name> , or you 'll be bitten sure ! "
" i 'm not running from a snake , " answered the young officer , and in a trice he whipped out his pistol .
as the snake came on he let drive .
his aim was true , and the snake dropped with its head half severed from its body .
" good for you ! "
said <name> , and now he picked up a stone as large as his hand .
this he dropped directly on the quivering head , and thus ended the battle , although the body of the snake continued to wriggle for a long while afterward .
with white face and set teeth , darry continued to play his catch and he was still at it when <name> and his brother came rushing up .
" did the snake bite you ? "
questioned the young captain .
" why did n't you pull in ? "
" i 've got something big on , " answered darry .
" i did n't want to miss it . "
" well , i never ! "
gasped captain moore .
" and you did n't let go even with that snake at your heels ?
well , you like a fish better than i do , i can tell you that . "
again the pole bent and threatened to break , but darry knew what he was doing , and promptly let the fish have more line .
then he wound in , and as the fish unexpectedly came close to shore he gave a sudden strong , steady sweep , and up came the prize on the rocks , flapping and <unk> violently .
" my , what a whopper ! "
cried <name> .
" he must weigh at least seven or eight pounds ! "
" he felt as if he weighed about forty when he was in the water , " returned darry , a little <unk> that the catch was not larger .
" that 's the biggest fish i 've ever seen taken out of this stream , " said the young captain .
" you can be proud of it , darry .
but to hold on when that snake was behind you   " he shook his head .
" oh , i knew you 'd come up and take care of that , cousin <name> . "
" but i might have been too late . "
" was it a poisonous one ? "
" some claim they are poisonous , but the surgeon up at the fort says not .
still i would n't want to risk a bite . "
" perhaps there are more around , " suggested <name> .
" no , the peculiarity of this variety of snakes is that they always travel alone .
if they meet they fight until one or the other is dead . "
" did you ever see such a fight , <name> ? "
" i did , when i first came to these parts .
i was riding over a <name> trail when my horse suddenly stopped , nearly throwing me .
on looking ahead to find out what had frightened my animal , i discovered two of these snakes .
they were facing each other , with mouths wide open and fangs showing .
each was so interested in the other that neither noticed me or the horse .
they faced each other for fully a minute , and during that time began to hiss louder and louder .
suddenly they sprang at each other , and one snake was stung in the eye .
he curled himself around the other snake 's neck , and in an instant both were in a tight ball .
they rolled around and around among the rocks .
once in a while a head would show itself , and then there would be more hissing .
after ten minutes the ball fell gradually apart , and then one snake crawled slowly away , more dead than alive .
the other snake proved to be dead , with both eyes torn from its head . "
" did n't you kill the other snake ? "
asked darry .
" i did .
that 's the first and only battle i ever saw between snakes , and it was terrible while it lasted , i can tell you that . "
fishing over , they went into camp , and here rested until old benson came back .
" the colonel was tickled to death to receive so much deer meat , " said the old scout .
" and he says you can stay until saturday night if you wish .
his <name> said she had been wanting some venison for several weeks . "
captain moore felt glad to think he could be out four days more .
" we 'll have a grand time now , " he said .
" benson , we can go right over yonder mountain , ca n't we ? "
" to be sure , " answered the scout .
" is the hunting good over there ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , lad .
there used to be some buffalo there . "
" good !
let us get a buffalo by all means ! "
cried darry .
" you go slow about <unk> a buffalo , especially a bull , " said the young captain .
" if we do sight a buffalo you let benson manage the whole affair . "
it was not long before the party were off once more , up a trail which led directly to the mountain top .
here traveling was difficult , and both riders and horses were glad to rest at frequent intervals .
when the top was gained the sun was just sinking in the far west .
the sight on every side was a glorious one , and as the captain had a small <unk> with him , they could see for miles .
" there is the fort , " said <name> , after looking through the glass .
" i can see the flag quite plainly . "
in the west were more mountains , and between these the valley for which they were bound .
timber and underbrush were dense in spots , while at other points the mountain sides were covered with bold , blackish rocks , with here and there luxuriant moss of several hues .
springs and <name> were numerous , so there was no danger of a water famine .
" i can make out some game over yonder , " said darry , when he had the glass adjusted to his sight .
" what is it ? "
" i ca n't see very plainly . "
" hand over the glass , " said old benson , and took a careful look .
but the setting sun now cast a deep shadow between the mountains , and he was unable to tell what it was .
" mountain deer , most likely , " he said .
" we 'll find out to-morrow  if the good weather holds out . "
" do you think we 'll have a storm ? "
asked <name> quickly .
" we 'll have something ; do n't you think so , captain ? "
" i think we 'll have more wind than rain , " returned captain moore .
" if we have a high wind , <name> it be safe right on the mountain top ? "
questioned <name> .
" we wo n't stay here , " said old benson .
" i know of a much better <unk> .
come , while it is still a little light . "
and they set off once more .
the place the old scout had in mind was close beside a <name> .
the wall of rocks was twice as high as their heads , and on either side was a growth of heavy timber .
there was a spring at hand and a grassy patch which promised them an easy bed , providing it did not rain .
" if it storms we can seek the shelter of the <name> , " said old benson .
" it wo n't be as comfortable as a house or cabin , but it <name> be a good deal better than being right in the open . "
the boys were glad enough to rest after the wearisome ride over the top of the mountain , and hungry for the meal the old scout took upon himself to prepare .
when the fire was lit it burned up lively , blowing the sparks in several directions .
as soon as he finished cooking the meal benson put out the blaze .
" too much wind , " he said , in reply to a question from <name> .
" i do n't want to set the whole mountain side on fire . "
benson was right about the wind , which was now sweeping strongly through the tops of the tall trees .
presently it came lower , and shook up the brushwood .
the night birds began to fly around , uttering their shrill cries .
the old scout listened to the birds with some concern .
" it 's going to be a big blow , " he said to darry .
" you are sure ? "
" yes .
the birds are afraid of it .
see how they flutter around ?
that 's a sure sign . "
" birds must know a good deal , benson . "
" they do , lad  a heap sight more than folks gives 'em credit for .
we could learn a good deal from them , if we 'd only set our minds to it . "
they took their time about eating , having nothing else to do .
then benson cared for the horses , putting them in the shelter of the brush , but away from the big trees .
at last it began to blow in <name> , and presently they heard a tree limb here and there snap with a loud report .
then the wind became so furious they were glad enough to huddle under the <name> for shelter .
" it 's coming now ! "
shouted old benson suddenly .
" hold fast to your hats , boys , or you 'll never see them again .
and sit down on the traps ! "
and in a moment more the fury of the wind storm was upon them .
chapter xv .
the result of a hurricane .
both <name> and darry had witnessed many a blow , but nothing to compare to that which now swept through the valley and up the mountain side .
the velocity of the wind was simply terrific , and it was well that old benson had cautioned them to hold on to their hats and sit on their traps , otherwise all would have been blown away to parts unknown .
" say , but this is fierce ! "
gasped darry , after several minutes had passed .
" it 's a regular hurricane , " said captain moore .
" i 've been out in them before .
fortunately they do not last over a quarter or half an hour .
down on the prairies of kansas they would call it a cyclone .
here , however , it ca n't get the sweep that it can on the level . "
" hark !
what is that ? "
put in <name> , as a tremendous crashing reached their ears .
" that 's a tree in the forest going down , " answered old benson .
" there goes another , " said darry , as more crashing was heard .
" i am glad we did n't go into the timber .
it 's more dangerous than lightning . "
" so it is ! "
shouted benson .
it was with difficulty that he made himself heard .
" here comes the worse of it ! "
he added .
a strange humming now filled the air , followed by twigs and flying branches .
overhead it was unusually dark , and they could scarcely see one another .
<name> and darry kept close together and clasped hands .
captain moore was on one side of them and old benson on the other .
as the wind struck the <name> it sent a shower of loose stones in all directions .
then it tore through the undergrowth where the horses were tethered .
next it seemed to hit the trees fronting the <name> .
one tall monarch of the forest was twisted completely from its roots and began to <unk> .
" see , the tree is coming on top of us ! "
shrieked <name> .
his words were drowned out in the fury of the wind and the crashing of the tree .
the next moment the monarch of the forest came down on the <name> with a bang , cracking the stone in several places .
the bottom limbs caught those under the <name> and pinned them fast .
to both boys it seemed as if the end of the world had come .
they rolled over , one on top of the other , and for several seconds lay dazed .
then they tried to get up , but found themselves unable to do so .
" get off of my chest ! "
gasped <name> , who was underneath .
" i ca n't  i 'm pinned down ! "
panted darry .
" boys , are you safe ? "
came from old benson , who was also caught .
" i  i guess so ! "
answered <name> .
" but it 's a tight squeeze . "
then the youth called out to his brother , but no answer came back .
" <name> must be hurt ! "
he exclaimed , his heart rising in his throat .
" <name> !
<name> !
where are you ? "
he continued .
still there was no answer , or if so the fury of the wind drowned it out completely .
the boys tried their best to move , but could only budge a few inches .
in five minutes the fury of the blow spent itself and the last of the wind sent the fallen tree rolling along the <name> a distance of several rods .
this released <name> and darry , and they arose to their feet dazed and bewildered and scarcely knowing what to do next .
it was now raining and darker than ever .
" benson ! "
called out <name> , " where is my brother ? "
" the captain must still be under the tree , " replied the old scout .
" he was next to you when the tree came down , was n't he ? "
" he was , but i believe the wind carried his hat off , and he made a dive for it .
that 's the last i saw of him . "
staggering to his feet , <name> looked around , trying to pierce the darkness .
darry followed him , and old benson also got up .
the scout had received a nasty cut on the shoulder , from which the blood was flowing .
in a few minutes <name> found his brother .
the captain lay on the rocks unconscious , a big lump on his forehead , where the largest of the <unk> branches had struck him .
kneeling at his brother 's side , the boy made a hasty examination .
" he 's alive ! "
he said .
" but he must have been struck a terrible crack . "
there was little to do excepting to bathe the unconscious <unk> head , and this was done .
in the meantime darry assisted old benson at binding up the wounded shoulder .
" take the tree off ! "
such were the first words captain moore uttered when he returned to consciousness .
it was some time before he could sit up .
" you are all right , <name>  the tree is not on you , " said <name> soothingly .
" but it came down right on top of me . "
" yes , it came down on all of us . "
" anybody killed ? "
" no .
benson has a cut on the shoulder , and you were knocked out .
feel the lump on your head . "
the young captain did so .
" phew !
but that 's a regular <unk> , is n't it ? "
he muttered .
" i suppose i can be thankful that i am alive . "
" we can all be thankful for that , <name> . "
" it was the greatest blow i ever experienced  in more ways than one , " said the captain .
" i see it is raining .
we had better go back to the <name> for protection . "
" do n't do it ! "
cried old benson , from out of the darkness .
" the tree struck the <name> a heavy blow , and we do n't want that down on our heads next . "
" no , let us give the <name> a wide berth , " said darry .
" i 'd rather remain right out in the open and get soaked than take any more risks . "
" the rain wo n't amount to much , " said benson .
" it never does after such a hurricane . "
the scout was right , and in less than half an hour after it had begun the downpour was over and the stars were struggling forth in the sky .
without delay a camp-fire was lit , and the blaze did much toward making them comfortable .
it was found that benson 's wound was by far the worst , yet the old scout said it would not interfere with his outing .
" i 've had lots of 'em in my time , " was the way he expressed himself .
" lots , and i aint dead yet .
'pears to me i 'm about as tough as a <unk> . "
it was found that the horses had not suffered in the least from the storm , although they had been much frightened .
soon they calmed down , and by midnight all was as quiet as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred .
but captain moore and old benson carried the marks of the adventure for many days after .
on the following morning no one felt much in the humor for hunting , and half a day was lost in " <unk> around , " as <name> expressed it .
this gave all a good rest and put the horses in fine <unk> , and when they started out after the midday meal all were once again in high spirits .
that night found them on the edge of what old benson called the buffalo ground , a broad valley where the grass was thick and of a peculiar richness .
on the way they had shot a number of birds and also a few small animals , but nothing of importance .
once some deer had been sighted , but the game was too far off to be pursued .
as they expected to remain at this point until ready to return home , the old scout proceeded to put up a shelter of brush , which , when completed , was almost as comfortable as a cabin .
on the bottom were strewn pine boughs , which gave the shelter a peculiar odor .
" best thing in the world for colds and weak lungs , that smell , " said benson .
" i 've never known it to fail . "
the boys declared that the odor made them sleep " like logs . "
" it 's queer we have n't seen any indians , " remarked darry .
" i thought these mountains were full of them . "
" they were full , before the fort was established , " answered benson .
" but the kind that are in this neighborhood do n't like white men very much , and they only come around the fort when it 's necessary .
but we may meet some after buffalo .
an injun <name> do a heap to get a critter like that . "
the old scout said it would be useless to go out in a body to look for buffalo , and so it was arranged that he should first go over the ground alone , leaving the captain and the two boys to look for smaller game .
this settled , benson soon set off , and a little later captain moore , <name> , and darry took their way along some bushes skirting a small water-course .
they went on foot , leaving their horses tethered near the shelter .
" i <name> go up one side of the stream , and you can go up the other , " said the captain .
" by doing that we 'll be sure to stir up anything within a hundred yards of the water . "
the boys agreed , and soon each member of the party was hard at work , on the hunt for any small game the vicinity might afford .
it was not long before they gained a spot where the underbrush along the <name> was thick .
here the stream divided into two branches , and , without knowing it , the captain and the boys became gradually more and more separated , the brush and small trees hiding each from the other .
" i do n't see much , " said <name> , after half a mile had been covered .
" those little birds are n't worth wasting powder and shot on . "
" it looks to me as if somebody had gone over this ground , " returned darry .
" see here , are n't those fresh footprints ? "
" i believe they are .
and see , here are the prints of several <unk> hoofs .
benson did n't come this way , did he ? "
" i do n't think he did . "
" then there must be other hunters not far off . "
they continued on their way , coming to a halt where the branch of the <name> entered a small , <name> canyon .
" no use of going further , " said <name> .
" let us retrace our steps . "
" where can your brother be ?
i have n't heard him for some time . "
<name> set up a yell , and both listened attentively .
no answer came back .
then both called in concert .
still the silence continued .
" it 's mighty queer , " was <name> 's comment " let us go back .
perhaps he 's in trouble . "
chapter xvi .
captain moore 's adventure .
in the meanwhile , never dreaming of the danger at hand , captain moore pursued his way up the other branch of the water-course .
here the underbrush was even more dense than where the boys were , and consequently he did not think it strange that he heard nothing of his brother and his cousin .
the fact that he stirred up no game nettled him , and he pushed on , determined to bring down something before he went back .
suddenly he espied something moving in the patch of wood ahead of him .
rifle in hand , he moved cautiously in the direction .
as he did this , a man glided out from the bushes to his right and followed him as silently as a shadow .
the man was <name> fetter .
the desperado was fully armed , and his face was black with hatred of the young army officer .
as the wood was gained , captain moore paused to locate the object he had seen .
but before he could do this , he was caught from behind and his rifle was wrenched from his grasp .
" fetter ! "
he ejaculated , as he caught sight of the desperado .
" up with your hands , captain moore ! "
growled the rascal savagely .
" up , i say !
i 've got the drop on you ! "
fetter had thrown the captain 's rifle to the ground , and now stood upon it .
in his hands he held his own weapon , and the muzzle was aimed at the young officer 's head .
realizing that discretion was the better part of valor , captain moore threw up his hands promptly , at which the desperado grinned wickedly .
" where did you come from , fetter ? "
demanded the captain .
" from not far away , captain . "
" what do you mean by treating a united states army officer in this fashion ? "
" i 've got a score to settle with you , captain .
do n't forget that . "
" are the rest of the gang around ? "
" they are . "
following his last words , <name> fetter gave a long , clear whistle , followed by two shorter ones .
at once an answer came back from the woods , and in a few seconds <name> gilroy appeared .
" hullo , so you 've got him , " sang out the leader of the desperadoes .
" a good haul .
how are you , captain moore ?
delighted to see me , i suppose . "
" not at all glad to meet you  considering the circumstances , " answered the young officer , trying to keep cool , although he realized that he was in a dangerous situation .
" well , you 're honest about it , anyway , " said gilroy with a brutal laugh .
" have you been following our party ? "
" you had better not ask too many questions , captain . "
by this time potts and two other men were coming up .
one of the latter carried his left arm in a sling .
captain moore 's recognized him as a fellow who had been wounded in the raid on the quartermaster 's party .
the desperadoes consulted among themselves for a few minutes , and then captain moore was ordered to march on .
" to where ? "
he asked .
" you 'll see when you get there , " answered fetter .
" now move , or , by the boots , i shoot you down where you stand ! "
seeing it would be worse than useless to resist , the young officer did as ordered , and the whole party moved away from the water-course and took to a trail leading back to the side of the mountain .
presently they came upon a number of horses , and here they mounted .
there were two steeds without riders , and captain moore was ordered to the back of one of these .
all rode off in a bunch , the prisoner being kept in the center of the party .
he had been searched and his pistol taken from him , also his pocket-knife , <unk> , and his money and jewelry .
in less than quarter of an hour a split in the mountain side was gained .
to the rear was something of a cave , the entrance overgrown with brush and vines .
at the mouth of the cave the party came to a halt , and were met by several other desperadoes .
" now you can get down , " said gilroy .
" fetter , i guess we had better bind his hands behind him . "
" you are going to bind me ? "
queried captain moore .
" and why not ?
you are such a nice chap , captain , we do n't want to part with you just yet . "
" why are you going to keep me a prisoner ? "
" well , do n't forget that we hold you responsible for that little mix-up when we were after the quartermaster 's <unk> . "
" i only did my duty , gilroy . "
" perhaps ; but if it had n't been for you and your men our gang would have been about twenty thousand dollars richer than we are to-day . "
" and i would n't have this lame arm , " growled the fellow who had been wounded .
" as i said before , i only did my duty , " repeated the captain calmly .
" even if i had n't arrived , do n't you suppose the quartermaster would have done all he could to defend himself ? "
" certainly ; but his party numbered only three .
however , we wo n't talk now .
we have other things to do .
get into that cave .
and do n't try to escape , or it <name> be the worse for you . "
with a downcast heart the young officer entered the cave , which was an old rendezvous of the desperadoes .
inside were a rude table and a couple of benches , and he threw himself down on one of the latter .
one of the gang , potts , put himself on guard outside , rifle in hand .
the others separated into two parties , and went off again .
" can they be going after <name> and darry , or after benson ? "
was the question the captain asked himself .
he waited until the <unk> outside had entirely ceased , then called to potts .
" where are they going ? "
he asked .
" that 's captain gilroy 's business , " was the answer .
" oh , so you call gilroy captain now ? "
" we do . "
" how many men is he captain of ? "
" about thirty , if you 're anxious to know . "
" thirty !
there are not that number of desperadoes within three hundred miles of this place . "
" all right , if you know better than i do . "
" has the captain gone off for the rest of my party ? "
" perhaps he has . "
" it wo n't do him any good to make them prisoners . "
" i reckon he knows his own business best , captain moore . "
" and what <name> you get out of this affair , potts ? "
" me ?
i 'll get my share when we make another haul . "
" do you expect to make another haul soon ? "
" as i said afore , better ask the captain .
we 're organized into a regular company now , and all the privates like me have to do is to obey orders .
you know how it is in the regular army . "
" a company of desperadoes , " mused captain moore .
" that 's something we have n't had out here in years . "
potts would talk no more after this , but sat down on a rock to smoke his pipe and continue his guard duty .
the young captain had had his hands bound tightly behind him , and , try his best , he found himself unable to either break or slip his bonds .
he was anxious concerning himself , but he was even more upset concerning his brother and his cousin .
" if they kick up a fuss , more than likely gilroy and the others <name> shoot them down ! "
he groaned .
" it 's too bad !
i thought we would have a splendid time hunting , and here we are , falling into all sorts of difficulties . "
as impatient as he was , he could do nothing but stalk around the cave .
the place was five yards wide by over a hundred feet long .
to the rear was a rude fireplace , the smoke drifting through some wide cracks overhead .
a small fire was burning , and he kicked a fresh log on the blaze , which soon gave him more light .
then he sat down again .
as he rested , his eyes roamed around the <name> apartment , and presently fell upon a sheet of paper lying under the table .
curious to know what it might contain , he bent down backwards , and by an effort secured the paper and placed it upon the table .
then , by the flickering flames , he tried to make out the writing it contained .
the letter  for such the sheet proved to be  was a communication which had been sent to <name> gilroy by a writer who signed himself <name> .
it ran as follows : " the plan <name> work perfectly , and all we must do is to wait until the money is at the fort .
i am sure the soldiers <name> leave as requested , and the defense <name> amount to little or nothing .
<name> see to it that colonel fairfield is drugged , and <name> treat captain moore and the other officers the same way , if i can get the chance . "
chapter xvii .
three prisoners .
it did not take <name> and darry long to retrace their steps at the water-course .
they continued to call to the young captain , and once <name> shot off his rifle as a signal , but , as we know , no answer came back .
" i ca n't understand this at all , " said <name> , when they halted near the shelter .
" i did n't hear him do any firing , did you ? "
" not a shot , " answered darry .
" he must have gone away from the <name> instead of along the bank . "
the two boys <name> around the shelter for some time , and then decided to follow up the trail left by the young officer .
this was easy for part of the distance , but soon the footprints became so indistinct that they came to another halt .
" stumped ! "
muttered <name> .
" we might as well go back to the shelter and wait till he returns .
one thing is certain , he has n't found any game , or we would have heard the firing . "
tired by their long tramp the boys sat down in the shelter , thinking that captain moore would return at any moment .
thus an hour was passed .
it was now noon , and <name> and darry set to work to prepare dinner for themselves .
the repast was just finished when <name> let out a cry of alarm .
" <name> gilroy ! "
he was right .
the captain of the desperadoes had appeared , followed by several others .
the boys were taken completely off their guard .
darry made a clutch for his rifle , but on the instant gilroy had him covered .
" leave the gun alone ! "
cried the rascal .
" leave it alone , or it <name> be the worse for you . "
" what do you want ? "
questioned <name> .
" we want you to behave yourselves , " answered fetter , who was in the crowd .
" you played us a nice trick that time you escaped from the cave , " growled gilroy , eying <name> darkly .
" do you blame me for wanting to get away ? "
" hardly .
but i 'll warrant you wo n't get away again . "
" then you consider me your prisoner ? "
" i do . "
" oh , <name> , do you think they met <name>   " began darry , and then stopped short .
" yes , your brother is waiting to meet you , " said fetter , addressing <name> .
" then he is also a prisoner ? "
" yes . "
<name> 's heart sank within him .
" if old benson was only here ! "
he muttered .
still guarding the boys , the desperadoes took their guns and also a pistol the young captain had loaned his brother .
" now get on your horses , " commanded gilroy .
" and mind , if you try to play us foul both of you <name> get shot . "
" are you going to take us to captain moore ? "
asked darry .
" perhaps . "
the desperadoes would answer no more questions , and in a few minutes the whole party was off for the cave .
both darry and <name> wished to leave behind some sort of message which benson might pick up , but they were watched so closely they could do nothing .
when the cave was gained the boys were told to go inside and keep quiet .
" <name> !
and you too , darry ! "
cried captain moore .
" i was afraid of this . "
" no wonder we could n't find you ! "
said <name> , and told of the hunt he and his cousin had made .
" these rascals are up to some deep game , " whispered the young captain .
" i just picked up a message which gilroy must have dropped , " and he told what the sheet contained .
" if i were you i 'd burn the paper , " said darry .
" then he wo n't know you have seen it . "
" no , i would like to keep the sheet   to show to colonel fairfield if i can manage to get away . "
" who wrote the message ? "
" i have no idea .
there used to be a half-breed around here whom the soldiers called <name> , but i thought he was dead .
he was thick with the <unk> indians . "
" then if he was the writer that would show that the indians are going to help the desperadoes , would n't it ? "
asked <name> .
before his brother could answer , <name> gilroy stalked into the cave .
" i told you not to talk , " he growled , as he cast his eye on the table and then around the <name> floor .
" you ca n't get away , so it wo n't do you any good to plot against me and my men . "
he was evidently looking for the sheet of paper , for presently he lit a torch and went over the whole cave carefully .
" see anything of a bit of paper around here ? "
he asked presently .
" what kind of a paper ? "
questioned darry .
" something with writing on it . "
" i have n't seen anything . "
" what was the writing about , gilroy ? "
asked captain moore .
" that 's my business .
then you have n't seen the paper ?
all right , " and the desperado stalked from the cave again .
" that was a close shave , " whispered the young captain .
" and it proves that the paper is valuable and that he is worried about it . "
slowly the balance of the day wore along , and at nightfall one of the men brought them a scanty supply of food .
they ate sparingly , fearing the food might be drugged , but no evil effects followed the meal .
at the mouth of the cave sat two of the desperadoes on guard , each with his rifle across his knees .
" a dash into the darkness might save us , " suggested darry , but the captain shook his head .
" no , those fellows are too good shots , " he said .
" we <name> have to remain as we are until something turns up in our favor . "
our friends wondered if the desperadoes would remain about the cave all night .
the other party which had gone off when gilroy went for <name> and darry had not yet returned , and the leader of the gang seemed to grow anxious concerning them .
" something has happened to them , " he said to fetter .
" perhaps we had better send somebody off on the trail to find out what 's up . "
so it was agreed , and fetter was the man chosen for the mission .
as may have been surmised by some of my readers , the other party had gone off to watch for old benson and make him a prisoner .
the crowd numbered three , and were desperadoes well acquainted with that territory .
the old scout had spent several hours in a vain endeavor to locate some buffalo , when , on resting in the crotch of a tree , he saw the desperadoes approaching .
the rascals were tired out with their search for the scout , and came to a halt directly under the tree .
" it 's a fool errand , " old benson heard one of the men say .
" <name> gilroy ought to have been satisfied with <unk> captain moore and those boys . "
" the captain wants to make a grand round-up , " answered another of the men .
" he told me that if we missed benson the scout might make trouble . "
benson listened to this conversation with intense interest , and soon learned the truth  that captain moore was already a prisoner , and that another party had gone off to bring in <name> and darry .
" this is a nice state of affairs , " he thought .
" these rascals mean mischief .
i wish i could get the drop on them .
i 'd soon teach them a thing or two . "
he watched the men as a cat watches mice , and , when the party of three moved on , stole after them like an indian on the warpath .
the desperadoes skirted the brushwood , but did not go out on the grassy slope of the valley , fearing that the old scout might be near by in hiding and see them .
they were a shiftless lot , and soon came to another halt , under some small trees .
here they threw themselves on the ground , and while two of them smoked their pipes the third indulged in a nap .
not a great distance off was a spring of pure cold water , and presently one of the men got up and walked over to this to get a drink .
" my chance for number one ! "
muttered old benson , and crawled after the desperado .
as the man turned the corner of a number of rocks , he came up behind , clapped his hands over the fellow 's mouth , and bore him to the earth .
chapter xviii .
benson puts some men in a hole .
the man whom old benson had attacked was taken completely by surprise , and he went to the ground easily .
but , once down , he struggled fiercely to release himself , and at the same time did his best to cry out for assistance .
" silence ! "
commanded the scout in a whisper .
" if you yell , it <name> go hard with you . "
the desperado now saw who had attacked him , and his face changed color .
but he continued to struggle , and was on the point of breaking away when the old scout hit him a heavy blow on the ear , which bowled him over and rendered him partly unconscious .
" hi !
did you call ? "
came from the other man who had been smoking .
old benson looked at the man before him , and saw that the fellow would be unable to do anything for several minutes to come .
" yes , " he answered , in a rough voice .
" here 's something funny to look at .
come quick . "
at once the second man leaped up , and without stopping to pick up his rifle came to the spring .
old benson quickly stepped behind a bush , out of sight .
" hullo , <name> , what 's the trouble ? "
cried the second man when he beheld his prostrate companion .
he bent over <name> , and while he was making an examination old benson came behind him and threw him as he had thrown the first desperado .
but the second man was " game , " and the struggle lasted for several minutes .
at one time it looked as if the old scout would get the worst of the encounter , but in the end he triumphed and the rascal was disarmed .
all the time the struggle was going on benson had been afraid the third man would rouse up , especially as the second called several times for help .
but the rascal had now fallen into a heavy sleep , and heard nothing .
what to do with the two desperadoes before him the old scout did not know , until he suddenly thought of a big <unk> hole he had discovered that very morning , while hunting for buffalo tracks .
the hole was fifteen to twenty feet in diameter and twice as deep , and once at the bottom he felt certain the desperadoes would have considerable trouble in getting to the top .
" come with me , " he said to the second fellow .
" and no monkey shines , if you know when you are well off . "
" wot <name> goin ' to do wid me ? "
growled the desperado .
" you 'll see .
your blood is so hot it needs cooling off , " answered the old scout .
he forced the man along , and soon the big hole was reached .
much against his <name> , the rascal was forced to drop to the bottom .
" now , if you try to climb up i 'll shoot you , " said benson , and ran back swiftly to where the second rascal was just getting out of his unconscious state .
before the other desperado could realize what was coming he , too , was down in the big hole .
old benson made certain that each of the men was relieved of all his weapons .
" now , i 'm going to keep watch on you , " he said , as a warning .
" be careful of what you try to do . "
" do n't leave us here ! "
pleaded <name> .
" a buffalo or a bear might fall in on us . "
" you 've got to take your chances on that , " answered benson .
the next movement of the old scout was to go back to where the third man was sleeping .
it was an easy matter to secure all the weapons belonging to this fellow .
then benson procured a rope from their outfit , and bound his feet together and then his hands .
during the latter operation the rascal awoke .
" wot <name> doin ' ? "
he demanded sleepily , and then , seeing the old scout , stared in open-mouthed astonishment .
" let go o ' me !
wot did <name> tie me up fer ? "
" you keep quiet , " said benson , with a broad smile over the trick he had played .
" whar 's <name> an ' <unk> ? "
" not far off . "
" did they go ter sleep too ? "
" you can ask them when you see them , <name> . "
" so you know me , do <name> ? "
" i do , and i have n't forgotten that affair at mountain meadow , " went on old benson , referring to a shooting in which <name> had been the guilty party .
at these words the desperado winced .
" well , now ye have got me fast , wot <name> goin ' to do with me ? "
he questioned .
" i 'm going to ask you a few questions , <name> , and i want you to answer me straight , too .
if i learn you 've given it to me crooked , i'll fix you for it , remember that . "
" wot do <name> want to know ? "
" where are gilroy and the rest of your crowd stopping ? "
" wot do <name> want to know that fur ? "
" answer the question  and tell me the truth , " and old benson looked sternly at his prisoner .
" at a cave near bald top , " returned <name> sulkily .
" but i do n't know how long they were goin ' ter stay there . "
" where were they going to take captain moore ? "
this question came as a surprise to the desperado .
" wot do <name> know about dat ? "
he cried .
" answer the question . "
" goin ' ter take him to dat same cave , first . "
" and then ? "
" dey was bound fer lone creek , up to where old <unk> onct had a claim . "
" you are telling me the truth ?
remember , if you put me on the wrong trail   " " it 's the truth , benson .
but , say , do n't be rough on me .
i aint such a bad egg .
dat shootin '   " " i know all about you , <name> .
now come with me . "
reaching down , the old scout untied the rascal 's feet , that he might walk , and then forced <name> to journey to the big hole .
here they found the other two desperadoes sitting at the bottom , growling over their luck and speculating upon what old benson intended to do next .
" if you leave us here we 'll die of hunger and thirst , " said one .
" no , you wo n't , " answered the old scout .
" you 've got your hands to work with , and if you aint lazy you can dig your way to the top inside of twenty-four hours . "
" and our hosses ? "
" i 'll take care of them , <name> .
if you want 'em again you can get 'em by applying at the fort . "
" at the fort ! "
" exactly , and in the meantime we 'll keep them in exchange for the animals <name> gilroy stole , when i and my friends were stopping at <name> leeson 's cabin . "
with the desperadoes safe for the time being at the bottom of the hole , old benson set off without delay for the cave near bald top mountain , as it was called for years by <name> mountain pioneers .
he rode his own horse , leading the others by his lariat , which he always carried with him .
he fully realized that there was danger ahead , and that if he wanted to assist his friends he must move with caution .
he knew that captain moore had been made a prisoner , but whether or not <name> and darry had been captured also was still a question .
coming in sight of the spot where the cave was located , he dismounted and tied all the horses in the woods at the foot of a slope .
then he crawled forward until he was within a hundred feet of the entrance to the cave .
he was just in time to see fetter depart on his mission .
the desperado passed within fifty yards of where the horses were stationed , and for several minutes benson was fearful that the animals would be discovered .
but fetter was looking in another direction , and so saw nothing of the steeds .
as darkness had come on , the desperadoes had lit a camp-fire near the entrance to the cave .
two men still remained on guard .
the others took it easy , and did very much as they pleased .
all waited for <name> and the others to return with fetter , bringing in old benson as a prisoner .
as the scout heard the talk about himself he chuckled grimly and grasped his rifle tighter than ever .
" reckon you 'd be surprised to know i was so close , " he muttered .
" well , if it comes to a mix-up , i 'll try to hold up my end , just you see if i do n't ! "
chapter xix .
escaping in the darkness .
it was after midnight when the camp settled down to rest .
fetter had not returned , and <name> gilroy was much worried in consequence .
yet he was tired out , having lost a good portion of the night previous in traveling , and he lay down with the others .
the guards at the entrance to the cave had been changed .
those now there were two young men , recruits to the desperadoes ' organization .
inside of the cave captain moore , <name> , and darry , having untied each other 's bonds , held a long consultation , the upshot of which was that they intended to escape if the deed could be accomplished .
" there is no use in telling you that we <name> run a big risk , " said the captain .
" but as for myself , these rascals are plotting against colonel fairfield and the soldiers at the fort , and i feel it my duty to do my best toward getting away and warning my commander . "
" whatever you do , <name> , i <name> back you up , so far as i am able , " was his brother 's answer .
" and i <name> back you up , too , " came from darry .
" but we must be cautious , for these desperadoes <name> not hesitate to shoot , and shoot to kill . "
and the boy shivered in spite of himself , for no matter how brave a person may be he seldom cares to run the risk of losing his life .
the prisoners had been ordered to keep to the back of the cave , but after all but the guards had retired captain moore made bold enough to walk carefully to the mouth of the place .
" hi , you want to keep back there , " growled one of the guards , promptly raising his rifle .
" do n't be hard on us , " pleaded the captain .
" let me get a little fresh air .
it 's vile in the back of the cave . "
" orders were to keep you out of sight , " growled the second guard .
" all right , i 'll go back as soon as i 've cleaned out my lungs . "
while the captain was speaking he was peering around sharply , trying to locate the other desperadoes and ascertain what the chances of escape really were .
as he gazed first to one side and then the other , he caught sight of a hand waving in the air .
a second later he made out the head and shoulders of old benson , as the scout rose to his feet behind some brushwood .
the thought that the scout was at hand to assist them cheered the young officer wonderfully , and he <name> a deep breath of satisfaction .
" are you going back soon ? "
growled one of the guards .
" yes , " answered the captain .
" but i say , " he went on , " why ca n't we come to terms ? "
" do n't want to make any terms with you , " growled the other guard .
" it might be better for you to do so . "
" we know our own business best , captain .
you just go back as you was ordered to do .
if you do n't   " " i do n't feel safe in the cave , men , to tell the truth .
what is that pounding overhead ? "
" pounding overhead ? "
" yes . "
" do n't know of any pounding .
do you , <name> ? "
" nary a bit , " replied the other guard .
by this time <name> and darry were just behind the young officer .
" watch out , " whispered captain moore .
" old benson is outside , in the bushes on the left . "
" good for him ! "
whispered <name> joyfully .
" what are you talking about ? "
demanded one of the guards .
" i want to know about that pounding overhead , " said captain moore .
" i do n't want the roof to cave in on us . "
he spoke so decidedly that both of the guards were deceived .
" nobody is up there , " said one of the two .
" it must be some wild animal . "
" ca n't one of you go up and look ? "
asked the young officer .
" you want the chance to get away , " was the suspicious answer .
" how can we get away , when we are unarmed and you have that rifle , " went on the captain , speaking loudly , for old benson 's benefit .
" it won't take you a minute to look . "
the men , however , refused to budge .
" we 'll stay right here , " said one , and the other nodded <unk> .
in the meantime old benson had crawled closer , until he was directly behind the pair .
now of a sudden he leaped between them , and as quick as a flash caught their rifles and twisted the weapons from their grasp .
[ illustration : " he leaped between them and caught their rifles . " ]
as the old scout did this , the young captain also leaped in , followed by <name> and darry .
the guards struggled , but with four against them could do little or nothing .
one , however , had a powerful pair of lungs , and before he could be stopped , set up a loud cry of alarm .
" come with me ! "
cried old benson .
" be quick , or it <name> be too late ! "
he led the way to the wood where the horses were tethered , and the captain , <name> , and darry came close behind him .
hardly had they gotten away from the guards when the whole camp was in alarm .
" what 's the trouble ? "
demanded <name> gilroy , leaping to his feet and catching up his rifle .
" the prisoners have escaped ! "
answered one of the guards .
" we were attacked by some men from behind .
there they go ! "
" stop ! "
roared the leader of the desperadoes , and raised his rifle .
but before he could take aim our friends were behind the shelter of the trees .
it took but a few seconds to loosen the horses , and as the captain and the two boys had long since relieved themselves of their bonds they were soon in the saddle and following the old scout , who seemed to know the way perfectly , despite the darkness .
" it was lucky you came up , benson ! "
cried <name> , as they dashed along .
" wait , we are not yet out of this trouble , " answered benson .
" hark !
they are following ! "
he was right .
gilroy and several of his men had rushed to their horses , and were now coming along the forest trail at a good rate of speed .
but their horses were no better than the animals our friends rode , so the desperadoes did not succeed in cutting down the distance between the two parties , and at last gave up the <name> .
" it has been a most stirring adventure from start to finish , " said captain moore after each had told his story .
" and it brings to an end this outing .
i must now get to the fort without delay . "
" and i am perfectly willing to go along , " said darry .
" there is no fun in hunting in a country where the desperadoes are so thick . "
" this <name> open colonel fairfield 's eyes , " went on the young officer .
" i should n't be surprised if he organized another expedition against gilroy 's gang and did n't let up on them until they were all either in prison or shot down . "
" it 's what they deserve , " came from old benson .
" i 'll go on such a hunt with pleasure . "
our friends continued in the saddle all night and until ten o'clock the next morning .
then , tired and hot , they went into camp by a cooling stream .
here they went fishing , and soon caught enough fish for dinner , after which they took a nap lasting several hours .
" and now for the fort ! "
cried captain moore ; " and the sooner we get there the better . "
the nap had done the boys a world of good , and as they rode along their spirits rose so high that darry proposed a race .
<name> was willing , and away they went , along the well-defined trail , before either the young officer or the old scout could stop them .
" they are full of life , " said <name> 's brother .
" let them go .
we 'll make the fort to-night , even if they do tire the horses a bit . "
" it 's all right if they do n't get into trouble , " answered benson .
on and on went the two lads , down something of a slope and then along a level stretch .
the bushes grew thick upon both sides , and here and there were numerous wild flowers .
at last they reached a glade <name> with green grass .
<name> was slightly ahead when he came to a sudden halt .
" back , darry ! "
he cried .
" get back behind the bushes . "
" what 's up ? "
queried his cousin , as he brought his steed to a standstill .
" buffaloes ! "
" buffaloes !
where ? "
" right around the <name> on our right .
see , they are coming this way !
here 's luck . "
<name> was right ; they had come most unexpectedly upon a herd of seven buffaloes .
the shaggy beasts were all large and <unk> .
they were not in the least alarmed , and came toward the boys at a slow but steady walk .
chapter xx .
something about white ox .
" what shall we do , <name> ; wait until your brother and old benson come up ? "
asked darry , as they surveyed the approaching animals .
" i suppose we ought to wait , " answered <name> .
" but if they take alarm , they 'll be off in double-quick order , i am afraid . "
each of the boys brought around his rifle , which had been picked up on leaving the desperadoes ' rendezvous , and saw that it was ready for use .
" if we could only signal to the others ! "
suggested darry impatiently .
" one of us might go back , " began <name> , when he gave a sudden start .
" they see us !
see , they are turning away ! "
he cried .
hardly had he spoken when darry fired , aiming at the largest of the buffaloes .
<name> followed , with a second shot , aimed at the same beast .
both bullets reached their <name> , and the animal was hit in the breast and in the right <unk> .
" we hit him ! "
ejaculated darry .
" let us fire at him again ! "
and he started to reload with all speed .
when struck the buffalo uttered a bellow of pain and went down on his knees .
but he quickly arose , and now came straight for the boys , his head down , as if to gore them to death .
crack !
it was darry 's rifle which spoke up , and the buffalo staggered , hit on the head , a glancing blow , however , which did little damage .
by this time <name> had reloaded , but he did not fire at once , hoping to get a closer shot at the beast .
in the meantime the others of the herd had disappeared completely .
soon the buffalo was less than fifty yards off , and not daring to wait longer <name> took steady aim and let drive .
his <unk> had been pointed at one of those gleaming , <unk> eyes , and the bullet sped true , entering the <name> of the beast .
with a roar and a grunt the buffalo went down , tearing up a great patch of grass in his fall .
" hi !
what 's all the shooting about ? "
the cry came from benson , as he rode down the trail at a breakneck speed , rifle ready for use .
" a buffalo ! "
cried darry .
" a buffalo ?
look out for yourselves . "
" yes , take care , " came from captain moore , who was behind the old scout .
" we 've fixed him , " said <name> , not without a good deal of pardonable pride .
" fixed him ? "
old benson looked out upon the glade .
" by the great <unk> ! "
he roared .
" gone and shot a buffalo all by your lone selves !
or maybe he was dead when you got here ? "
he added suspiciously .
" you would n't think he was dead , if you could have seen him come toward us , " said darry .
" but who shot him ?
i heard four shots . "
" and every one of 'em went into the buffalo , " answered <name> .
" two for darry and two for myself . "
" but <name> finished him , with a shot in the eye , " said darry quickly .
" but darry hit him in the leg , and that lamed him , " said <name> , just as quickly .
" i guess honors are even . "
" certainly remarkable shooting , " was captain moore 's comment .
" old hunters could n't do better , could they , benson ? "
" not much better , captain .
i never would have dreamed of it , boys .
and to think i could n't get a smell of 'em when i was out looking 'em up , " benson said , shaking his head dubiously .
" this buffalo was n't alone , " said darry .
" the others went in that direction .
you might follow them up . "
" it would n't be any use now , lad .
they are gone , and that 's the end of it . "
" we must n't lose too much time , " put in the young captain .
" i must make the fort to-night , no matter what comes . "
" but , <name> , we ca n't leave this magnificent buffalo behind , " pleaded his brother .
" darry and i <name> want the skin , and we 'll want to mount the head and horns , eh , darry ? "
" to be sure . "
" how long <name> it take to skin the beast , benson ? "
" an hour and over , if i want to make a good job of it , " was the slow reply .
" it 's too nice a hide to ruin by quick cutting . "
" supposing i ride ahead then , and you follow with the boys as soon as you are ready ? "
this was agreed to , and in a minute the young officer was off once more , urging his horse forward at the animal 's best speed .
" now i can take my time , " declared old benson .
" sorry i aint got my hunting-knife . "
" where is it ? "
" it was lost in the shuffle with those desperadoes i put in the hole . "
the old scout chuckled .
" my !
my !
how they must love me for putting 'em down there ! "
" they 'll have it in for you when they get out , " remarked darry .
" oh , i 'm not afraid , lad . "
the buffalo had fallen into something of a heap , and it took their combined efforts to turn the huge carcass over .
then old benson got out his <unk> , sharpened the blade upon the leather of his boot , and set to work , the boys assisting him as much as possible , which was not much , since the process was entirely new to them .
" that <name> be a load , " said <name> , when they had the skin and a part of the head free .
" how much do they weigh , benson ? "
" close on to a hundred pounds . "
" and how shall we <name> that load ? "
" we 'll tie it up into something of a long bundle and take turns at <unk> it behind our saddles .
of course we wo n't be able to move along as fast as before , but that wo n't be necessary , now the captain has gone ahead to break the news . "
the trail now led toward the river where darry had almost lost his life by being hit with the drifting tree .
the path was uncertain in spots , and they had to be careful for fear of getting into some <unk> hole .
" what a splendid place for a ranch home ! "
suggested darry .
" benson , i am surprised that there are so few cabins in this neighborhood . "
" there used to be quite a number through here , lad ; but the <unk> and other indians burnt them all down .
i suppose new settlers <name> come in , now the indians are behaving themselves . "
" but are they behaving themselves ? "
questioned <name> .
" they are doing a good deal better than formerly , <name> .
there is only one old chief in this neighborhood who seems to want to cause trouble . "
" and who is that ? "
" white ox .
he is some sort of a relative to sitting bull , so i 've been told , and he wo n't give in that the white man is master of the situation .
he has tried to get his warriors to rise against us several times , but so far he has n't accomplished much . "
" where is white ox now ? "
" over behind yonder mountain to the north .
he is chief of a band that <name> between a hundred and a hundred and fifty people .
he himself is one of the best indian shots in the west . "
" it 's a pity they ca n't become citizens as well as other folks , " remarked darry .
" that 's the whole trouble , lad .
the united states did n't treat them right in the first place , and we are bound to suffer in consequence .
but in the end the injun <name> be wiped out completely . "
as night came on , countless stars shone in the sky , making the trail fairly light .
old benson rode in advance , with darry next and <name> bringing up the rear .
presently the old <name> <name> rein , and motioned the others to do the same .
" somebody ahead , " he said in a low voice .
" four or five men on <unk> .
if i aint mistaken they 're injuns , too . "
" indians ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" do they come this way often ? "
" no , lad .
fact is , they have n't any right over here , so close to the fort .
it 's against colonel fairfield 's rules . "
" then what can they be doing here ? "
" that 's for us to find out . "
old benson led the way to a side trail , and then into the shelter of a number of trees .
he quickly passed the pelt over to darry .
" both of you stay here until i get back , " he said .
" i 'm going to find out what those redskins are up to . "
" you wo n't be gone long , <name> you ? "
asked <name> .
" do n't expect to be gone over an hour at the most .
if i aint back in two hours , make up your mind something has happened .
then you 'll have to get back to the fort the best way you can , " concluded the old scout .
a moment later the darkness of the night hid him from their view , and they were left alone in the bit of <unk> .
chapter xxi .
a trick of the enemy .
" i must say i do n't fancy this much , " observed <name> , after the sounds of benson 's departure had lost themselves in the distance .
" nor do i like it , <name> , " came from darry , with a long-drawn sigh .
" but i guess we 'll have to make the best of it . "
" with what was on that message my brother found in the cave , and what benson said about this indian chief , it looks as if the folks at the fort might have trouble in the near future . "
" that 's true , too .
i <name> <name> got through in safety . "
dismounting , the two boys sat down under the trees to wait in the darkness .
the horses were glad enough of the rest , and fell to cropping the short grass which showed itself in spots in the vicinity .
thus half an hour passed .
the silence was oppressive , broken only by the occasional note of a night bird or the dismal croaking of a frog in some hollow and the answering squeak of a lizard .
" somebody is coming ! "
cried <name> at last , and both of the boys stood on the defensive , rifles in hand .
the party came closer and closer , and at last they made out the form of the old scout .
he was riding at the top of his speed .
" quick !
follow me ! "
he exclaimed , as he dashed up .
" there is not a moment to lose ! "
the boys needed no second bidding , and in a trice they were in the saddle once more and riding after old benson , who now took to another trail leading somewhat to the south of that formerly pursued .
" you saw the indians ? "
questioned <name> , as they dashed on .
" i did .
white ox is ahead , with sixty or seventy of his best warriors .
from what i could learn he and lieutenant <name> have had a fight , and half a dozen of the soldiers were either killed or wounded .
now white ox is marching for the fort . "
" to attack it ? "
" i ca n't say about that , but i think he is going to hide in the vicinity , to wait for the coming of the desperadoes . "
" and what of my brother ? "
questioned <name> anxiously .
" did he get through all right ? "
" nothing was said about the captain , lad .
i suppose he got through . "
it was hard to talk while riding at such a rate of speed , and soon the conversation came to an end .
the horses now showed plain evidence of their long journey , but each rider kept his steed at his best .
it was after two o'clock in the morning when the fort came into view , dark and silent in the midst of the plain surrounding it .
benson now rode in advance .
" halt ! "
came the sudden command , while the scout was still a hundred yards from the stockade .
the command was loud and clear , but the speaker was invisible .
" it 's all right , friend , " answered the old scout .
" it 's me , <name> benson .
let me in , quick , i 've news for the colonel . "
" all right , benson , " was the answer .
" but who is that behind you ? "
" <name> moore and darry germain .
is the colonel sleeping ? "
" the colonel is very sick . "
" sick ? "
" yes . "
" what 's the trouble ? "
" the surgeon ca n't make out exactly .
he 's in a sort of stupor , and they ca n't rouse him . "
by this time the stockade gate was open , and all three of our friends lost no time in entering the yard .
then the gate was closed and barred again .
" has captain moore returned ? "
asked <name> , as soon as he could get the guard 's attention .
" i have n't seen him . "
" how long have you been on duty ? "
" came on about an hour ago . "
" has lieutenant <name> come in ? "
came from benson .
" not that i know of ; reckon not , " answered the guard .
" worse and worse ! "
groaned the old scout .
" who is in command here ? "
" captain <name> .
but he 's about half sick , too . "
" it 's a trick of the enemy ! "
cried darry .
" a trick ? "
queried the guard with interest .
" yes , a trick , " put in <name> .
" benson , had n't they better sound the alarm ? "
" yes , and i 'll interview captain <name> . "
no more was said , and , while the sentinel called the corporal of the guard , the old scout hurried off to find the captain in command .
with him went <name> and darry .
<name> 's heart was like a lump of lead , for he was much concerned over the <unk> of his brother .
had the captain met the indians and been killed or taken prisoner ?
captain <name> was in a sound sleep , but quickly roused up when told that an important message awaited him .
he met the party in one of the living rooms of the fort .
his head was tied up in a wet towel , and his eyes showed that he was suffering .
" this is certainly a <unk> plot , " he said , when all had told their story .
" the desperadoes and indians intend to combine in an attack on the fort .
<name> is undoubtedly that wily old half-breed who is still alive and who is very thick with white ox .
but i did n't know he could write . "
" but what about this money at the fort ? "
asked <name> .
" the money is here , in a chest that is hidden away .
it amounts to forty thousand dollars in gold , and is the property of the <unk> mining company .
it was left for <unk> until mr. <unk> could have it transported to <name> .
you see , <unk> is a brother-in-law to colonel fairfield . "
" the colonel must be drugged , " said benson .
" that 's the reason he acts so queerly . "
" i suppose so , and that is what has affected me , i presume , " answered captain <name> .
" last night my head ached as if it would split open .
we must tell the surgeon of this .
perhaps he can then do something to relieve colonel fairfield . "
the captain lost no time in issuing the necessary orders , and in a few minutes the whole place was in alarm and the soldiers were on the watch for the first appearance of the indians .
" my poor husband drugged ! "
cried mrs. fairfield , when she heard the news .
" what villains those indians and desperadoes are !
doctor , can you do nothing ? "
" i think i can , madam , " answered the surgeon .
" much depends upon what drugs were administered and how much the colonel has taken .
rest assured i <name> do my best for him . "
upon examination it was found that out of all the officers at the fort only four were fit for duty , all the others being sick , either through being drugged or otherwise .
of the privates not more than sixty-five were in a condition to fight should an attack come .
" and the worst of it is , the men wo n't know what to eat or drink after this , " said captain <name> to benson .
" who can tell what has been drugged ?
perhaps it 's in the very bread we eat and the water we drink . "
strict orders were given to the men to touch nothing until the surgeon had passed upon it .
then the doctor got out his medicines to counteract the drugs , and set to work to bring the colonel and the other sufferers out of their stupor .
hour after hour went slowly by , and still captain moore did not return .
what had become of his brother , <name> could not imagine .
he feared the worst , and when morning came it was all he could do to keep back the tears .
" do n't take it so to heart , <name> , " said darry sympathetically .
" it may be all right . "
" but he said he was going to ride straight here  you heard him , darry . "
" so i did , but he may have seen the indians or met lieutenant <name> , and that might have changed his plans .
anyway , i would n't worry too much just yet . "
with the coming of daylight captain <name> brought out his <unk> glass and swept the surroundings of the fort with extreme care .
" some camp-fires are burning to the northward , " he announced .
" any injuns ? "
questioned old benson laconically .
he had been told to come along to the top of the fort for consultation .
" nobody in sight , benson . "
" humph !
well , i do n't calculate they are far off . "
" nor i , from what you and the boys told me .
how long <name> it take those desperadoes to reach here ? "
" they ought to arrive this morning , if they are not with the injuns already . "
" all told , we have about seventy officers and men available for duty , " went on the captain thoughtfully .
" what is worse , they must know how greatly our garrison is reduced , since they have had that skunk of a <name> do the <unk> for them . "
" the injuns number over sixty , and if there are thirty desperadoes , that <name> give them a force of almost a hundred , or twice as many as we have , captain .
but then , we hold the fort .
they ca n't come anywhere near us without being cut down  if we set out to do it . "
" of course .
but white ox may send off for more indians  when he hears how small the available garrison is . "
" does he know much of affairs here ? "
" i am afraid he does .
there were two indians here yesterday , to lodge a complaint against a miner who had stolen a horse from them .
i think , now , that the complaint was a blind , and the indians were here merely to size up the situation , " concluded captain <name> .
chapter xxii .
in the hands of the enemy .
little dreaming of all the adventures in store for him , captain moore left the scene of the buffalo shooting and rode forth swiftly in the direction of fort <name> .
he felt that he carried news of great importance and the sooner he gained the fort the better .
should anything happen to colonel fairfield the command of the post would fall upon himself , as next in rank .
as he dashed along the trail , over hill and valley , he reviewed the situation with care , and the more he thought of it , the more worried did he become .
" something is going to happen  i can feel it in the air , " he muttered .
the thought had scarcely crossed his mind when something did happen , but not exactly what he anticipated .
a shadow fell across his path , and as he <name> rein he found himself confronted by several indians .
" white officer , stop ! "
cried the leader of the red men sternly .
" hullo !
what do you want ? "
demanded the captain .
the meeting was a complete surprise .
" want to have a talk . "
" who are you ? "
" me red wolf , belong to white ox tribe , " returned the indian with a scowl .
" and what are you doing out here at this time of night , red wolf ? "
" indians on a big hunt .
see buffalo yesterday . "
" yes , i saw one of the buffaloes myself . "
captain moore paused , not knowing how to go on .
" you are pretty close to the fort . "
" red wolf and warriors get on the wrong trail , " was the slow reply .
" but want to talk now .
come along . "
as the indian concluded he caught the captain 's steed by the bridle .
" let go the horse . "
" want to talk to white officer . "
" you have n't any right to touch my horse . "
hardly had the words been spoken when two indians rushed up behind the captain and dragged him to the ground .
the fellows were large and powerful , and they disarmed him before he could even fire a shot .
without further ado captain moore was forced to march along , between two of the red men , while a third led his horse .
a route around the rocks was taken , and presently they came to a dense bit of <unk> .
in the midst of this was a clearing , and here was the camp of some ten or a dozen indians .
the indians at hand were a guard over several white soldiers , and to his intense surprise the young captain recognized some of lieutenant <name> 's men .
" what are you doing here ? "
he asked .
" had a mix-up and came off second best   " began one of the soldiers , when an indian guard clapped a dirty hand over his mouth and ordered him to be silent , under penalty of death .
then the captain was taken to another part of the glade , and here he was made a close prisoner by being bound , hands and feet , to the trunk of a blasted tree .
red wolf wished to know what the captain had been doing away from the fort .
" i 've been on a hunting expedition . "
" alone ? "
" no . "
" where are the others ? "
" safe , by this time .
what do you intend to do with me , red wolf ? "
" white ox shall decide that , " grunted the red man .
" then he is on this hunt , too ? "
" he is . "
" when <name> he be here ? "
" soon . "
" do n't you know that i am an army officer , and that you are laying up a good deal of trouble for yourself by making me a prisoner ? "
" the white man has not treated the indians right . "
" this is no way to redress wrongs , red wolf .
why do n't you go to colonel fairfield and make a complaint ?
he <name> send the story to the great father at washington . "
" the great father <name> not listen .
we have sent many complaints  as the white captain knows . "
" he <name> listen  if the complaint is a just one .
the trouble is , the indians <name> not obey colonel fairfield 's orders . "
" and why should they obey the white man ?
is not white ox their chief ? "
" that is true .
but the land is now the white man 's , and the indians must obey the great father at washington , or in the end it <name> go hard with them . "
" not so ! "
cried red wolf savagely .
" in the end the white man <name> be driven eastward , where he belongs .
no one shall rule in these mountains but the red man .
white ox and the other great chiefs have spoken . "
" what !
you are going on the warpath ? "
" the hatchet may be dug up , if the white man <name> not listen to the red man . "
" i know what the trouble is , red wolf .
<name> gilroy and that <unk> half-breed , <name> , have set you up to this .
they have filled your ears with false stories about our cruelty and about much money at the fort . "
by the look on the indian 's face the young officer saw that he had struck the truth , at least in part .
but the red man would talk no more , fearing he had already said too much , and he stalked off , warning a guard to be careful and not let the captain escape .
when left to himself , captain moore 's reflections were very bitter .
" if the redskins are out in force they 'll probably fall in with benson and the boys , " he told himself .
" and if they do there <name> surely be trouble .
benson wo n't allow them to take him alive , and that <name> mean a good deal of shooting all around . "
he listened attentively for shots in the distance , but none came , and this caused him to be more perplexed than ever .
just before daybreak several additional indians came in , and the young officer and the soldiers were told to march .
their feet were unfastened , but their hands were not , and they were forced to move with the red men on all sides of them , and each of the enemy fully armed and ready to shoot them down at the first show of resistance or escape .
from one of the privates captain moore learned that lieutenant <name> and the other soldiers had escaped , but what had become of them nobody knew .
the little body of whites and indians marched over a mountain trail for fully four hours .
the step was a lively one , and when the party came to a halt even the soldiers used to a hard march were tired out .
" those redskins can walk the legs off of anything i know of , " was the way one old soldier expressed himself .
" they are like some of these wiry mustangs who do n't know the meaning of rest . "
" this region is strange to me , peck .
do you recognize it ? "
" i do , captain moore .
yonder is <unk> fall , and this trail leads to silver gulch . "
" then we are about six miles from nowhere in particular . "
" you 've struck it , captain .
why they brought us to such a forsaken spot is more than i can guess  unless they are going to shoot us down like dogs and leave us for the wolves to feed on .
the wolves are thick around here , so leeson told me . "
" i do n't believe they 'll shoot us down .
they are not desperate enough yet .
but they may do it , if they attack the fort and lose heavily .
that <name> open their eyes , and make them as mad as hornets . "
a little later silver gulch , a wide opening in the rocks of the mountain , was gained , and here the soldiers were again made fast to several trees .
then the indians prepared their midday meal .
they took their time about eating , and did not offer the white men anything until they had finished .
" they do n't intend to treat us any too good , " was peck 's comment .
" captain , ca n't we fix it to get away ? "
" i intend to escape if i can manage it , " returned the young officer .
" but we must be careful , for they are fully armed , and they watch us like so many foxes . "
slowly the afternoon wore away , and with the coming of night it grew darker than usual , as though a storm was brewing .
" a storm ought to help us , " said the captain .
some of the indians had departed , so that now the guard consisted of but four warriors .
these red men walked around each prisoner , seeing to it that all the bonds were tight .
as the men passed peck the old soldier watched his chance , and , unknown to the red men , caught a hunting-knife from the belt of one of the number .
this knife was concealed up his sleeve , and then the soldier waited for his chance to use the blade , which was as sharp as a razor .
the indians decided that two of their number should sleep , while the other two remained on guard .
soon those to retire turned in , while the others sat down to smoke their pipes .
this was peck 's opportunity , and with a slash of the hunting-knife he released his hands .
a moment later the lariat around his ankles was likewise severed .
watching his chance , peck passed the knife to captain moore , and then went back to his position by the tree as if still fastened .
thus the knife was passed from soldier to soldier until all were liberated .
all told , the party numbered six , and nobody was armed , excepting peck , to whom the hunting-knife had been returned .
motioning to the others to keep quiet , captain moore picked up a stick of wood lying near and threw it in some bushes a distance away .
this made considerable noise , and instantly the two guards gazed in the direction .
" a wolf , perhaps , " said one of the indians , in his native tongue , and walked over to the bushes .
his companion started to follow , when captain moore leaped upon him and bore him to the earth .
chapter xxiii .
a panther in camp .
as captain moore fell upon one of the indians , peck the private stole after the guard who had walked toward the bushes .
the other soldiers jumped to where the remaining indians were sleeping , to gain possession of the firearms .
the indian the captain had tackled was a young but powerful brave , and he put up a hard fight to release himself .
but he had been taken unawares , and after he was on the ground the captain saw to it that he did not get up .
in the meantime the indian near the bushes turned just in time to see peck raise the hunting-knife .
crack !
went the red man 's rifle , and the bullet clipped the soldier 's ear .
the shot was so close that to the day of his death peck carried in his face some traces of the burnt powder .
the shot was the last the indian ever fired , for in the midst of the smoke peck hurled himself at the warrior , and a second later down came the hunting-knife , piercing the red man 's back and entering his right lung .
the stroke was a fatal one , and before the fighting in the glade came to an end the indian had breathed his last .
when the sleeping indians awoke they could not for the moment realize what was going on .
in his bewilderment one leaped up and rushed at a soldier , who promptly laid him low by a heavy blow from a rifle stock , which almost cracked the warrior 's skull .
seeing this , the other brave became frightened and ran for the bushes .
" do n't let him escape ! "
cried captain moore , who was still holding his man down .
at once two of the soldiers ran after the fleeing indian , and presently two rifle shots rang out , followed by a scream from the red man .
" he 's done for , " said one of the soldiers , after the smoke had cleared away .
" he has gone to his happy <unk> . "
after this turn of affairs it did not take the soldiers long to make prisoners of the two indians who remained alive .
these fellows were in truth much frightened , but tried their best to suppress their feelings .
from one of the indians , captain moore learned that more indians were expected early the next morning .
" that 's all right , " said he .
" they <name> come in time to release you and save you from starvation . "
" going to tie 'em up , captain ? "
asked peck .
" yes .
there is nothing else to do . "
" better shoot 'em . "
" i ca n't shoot them in cold blood , peck .
that would not be human . "
" the wretches do n't deserve to live , captain .
the indians and those desperadoes are plotting to wipe out everybody left at the fort . "
" i know that .
still , i can not bring myself to take their lives  and we ca n't stop to take them along as prisoners .
the sooner we get back to the fort the better . "
" if we can get back , " put in another soldier .
" i do n't believe the fort is surrounded just yet , " returned the young officer .
" but if it is ? "
" then , perhaps , it <name> be better for us to be out than in . "
" you would n't desert the crowd at the fort , would you ? "
" you know me better than that , <unk> .
we might be able to ride to the next fort and obtain re-enforcements . "
" that 's so , captain !
i did n't think of that . "
leaving the dead indians in the bushes and the others tied to the trees , the captain and his companions now lost no time in striking out for the fort .
fortunately , peck was well acquainted with every foot of the territory to be covered , and he led the way by a route which was fairly easy and as direct as could be expected , considering the wild region to be covered .
as he hurried along , the young captain 's thoughts were busy .
where were <name> , darry , and benson , and how were things going at the fort ?
