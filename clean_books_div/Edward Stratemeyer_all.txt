preface the life of <name> <name> is one well worth studying by any american boy who wishes to make something of himself and mount high on the ladder of success .
the <unk> president of our country is a fine type of the true american of to-day , full of <unk> and vigor , quick to comprehend , and equally quick to act , not afraid to defend his opinions against all comers when satisfied that he is in the right , independent , and yet not lacking in fine social qualities , physically and morally courageous , and with a <name> in himself and his god that is bound to make for good so long as he clings to it .
<name> <name> comes from countless generations of fighting stock , both in this country and abroad .
and yet as a youth the future hero of san <name> hill was a delicate lad , and many fears were entertained that he might not live to manhood .
but life in the open air , with judicious athletic exercise , accomplished wonders , and he became strong and hardy to an astonishing degree .
the boyhood days of the future president were spent in new york city and at the family 's country home , oyster bay , long island .
from there he went to harvard college , from which he graduated with high honors .
still somewhat delicate in health , he travelled in europe , studied for a short time at dresden , and took to climbing the alps and other noted mountains .
his mind had <unk> toward literature , and he was writing a naval history of the war of 1812 when something prompted him to take up politics , and almost before he knew it he was elected a new york state assemblyman .
he served in this capacity for three terms , and many are the stories told of how he fought against corruption first , last , and all the time .
the death of his first wife and of his beloved mother were at this time a great blow to him , and leaving his one little daughter with relatives , he struck out for the great west , where , in the bad lands , so called , he located as ranchman and <name> , filling in his spare hours by studying and by writing on various outdoor subjects , works which have become decidedly popular , and which show well his gifts as an author and as an observer of nature .
while still in great part a successful ranchman , he ran for mayor of new york and was defeated .
he now devoted himself with increased energy to his literary labors until , soon after , he was appointed by president <name> a member of the civil service commission .
he served on this commission with marked ability for six years , when he resigned to become police commissioner of new york city .
<name> <name> 's work as a police commissioner <name> not be readily forgotten .
the whole tone of the service was at once raised , and for the first time in many years the metropolis had " dry " sundays , when every saloon in the city was tightly closed .
this strict compliance with the law made him some enemies , but to these he paid no heed , for he was doing only his duty .
when <name> <name> was nominated for the presidency the first time , <name> <name> was one of his most enthusiastic supporters .
upon the election of <name> , <name> d. long was appointed secretary of the navy and <name> <name> became the first assistant secretary .
ever since writing his naval history the newly appointed assistant had made a close study of naval matters , and now he applied himself with vigor to the duties of his office ; and it was primarily through his efforts that when the war with spain came , our war-ships and our coast defences were in much better condition than they had been at any time previous in our history .
with the outbreak of the war , <name> <name> resigned .
" my duty here is done , " he said .
" my place is in the field . "
and without loss of time he and his intimate friend , dr. <name> wood , began the organization of that body of troops which was officially designated as the first united states volunteer cavalry , but which speedily became known everywhere as the rough riders ,  a body as unique as the world has ever seen , being made up of men from all over the union , but principally from four territories , and including hunters , cowboys , soldiers of fortune , <unk> and <unk> champions , college graduates , <unk> , with american , <name> , dutch , <name> , mexican , and indian blood in their veins ,  truly a remarkable collection , but every man and officer strong and hardy , full of courage , a good horseman , and a fine shot .
from the very start , the rough riders were anxious to get into the fight , and the opportunity was not long in coming .
from <name> the command was transported to <unk> , on the southern coast of cuba , and then began the advance upon the city of <name> , which brought on the engagement at la <unk> , followed by the thrilling battle of san <name> hill , in which the rough riders distinguished themselves in a manner that <name> never be forgotten .
in the very thickest of this fight was colonel <name> , urging his men forward to victory , regardless of the shot and shell falling upon all sides .
a hero truly , and such heroes are not forgotten .
upon the close of the war <name> <name> thought to retire to private life , but this was not to be .
arriving at new york , he was hailed with delight by thousands , and at the next election was made governor of the empire state .
as governor he made friends in both of the leading political parties by his <unk> and his <name> honesty .
men might differ with him politically , but they could never accuse him of doing that which he himself did not firmly believe was right .
his term as governor had not yet expired when president <name> was nominated for a second term .
again the people at large <unk> for <name> , and against his <name> protestations he was forced to accept the nomination for the <unk> .
he was elected , and at the proper time took his seat as presiding officer of the senate .
it was at this time a blow fell upon our nation from which we have scarcely yet recovered .
president <name> was struck down by the cowardly hand of an assassin .
the vice-president was at this time off on one of his favorite outings , but with all possible speed he came back and was sworn in as president .
it was a great responsibility , and many feared that great changes in our government might result .
but the fears proved groundless .
young as he was ,  and he is the youngest of all of our presidents ,  he took upon himself the duty of carrying out the intentions of his predecessor , and proving to the world once again that , even though a president die , " the government at washington still lives . "
there is another side to the character of our president which must not be overlooked .
he is of strong religious convictions and a member of the dutch reformed church .
it is seldom that he is given to preaching , but when he does his words have a sincerity that proves much for the foundation of his character .
he stands for what is honest and upright in political and private life , and although , being but human , he may make mistakes , he remains a chief magistrate well deserving the highest honors our nation can bestow .

the twentieth century looms before us big with the fate of many nations .
if we stand idly by , if we seek merely swollen , <unk> ease and ignoble peace , if we shrink from the hard contests where men must win at hazard of their lives and at the risk of all they hold dear , then the bolder and stronger peoples <name> pass us by and <name> win for themselves the domination of the world .
let us therefore boldly face the life of strife , resolute to do our duty well and manfully ; resolute to uphold righteousness by deed and by word ; resolute to be both honest and brave , to serve high ideals , yet to use practical methods .
above all , let us not shrink from strife , moral or physical , within or without the nation , provided that we are certain that the strife is justified ; for it is only through strife , through hard and dangerous endeavor , that we shall ultimately win the goal of true national greatness . "
these words , taken from president <name> 's remarkable speech on " the strenuous life , " show well the character of the man , his lofty ideals , his <name> courage , his absolute honesty , and <unk> patriotism .
he is a typical american in the best sense of the word , and his life is worthy of careful study .
from it american boys of to-day , and in generations to come , may gain lessons that <name> do them much good .
<name> <name> , the <unk> president of our country , was born in new york city , october 27 , 1858 .
the place of his birth was the old family mansion at 28 east twentieth street , in a neighborhood which , at that time , was the abode of wealth and culture .
the building is one of a row , of a type to be seen in hundreds of other places , of brick and stone , four stories and a basement high , the upper floor being an attic .
a heavy railing runs from in front of the basement up the broad front steps to the doorway .
inside , the rooms are large and comfortably arranged , and there was , in those days , quite a nice garden in the rear .
[ illustration : <name> <name> 's birthplace .
28 e. 20th street , new york city . ]
it can truthfully be said that <name> <name> comes from a race of soldiers and statesmen , and that dutch , scotch , french , and <name> blood flows in his veins .
this being so , it is no wonder that , when the <unk> war broke out , he closed his desk as assistant secretary of the navy , saying , " my duty here is done ; my place is in the field , " and went forth to win <name> on the battle-field of san <name> hill .
five generations of <unk> lived in or near new york previous to the birth of <name> <name> , the father of the president , in 1831 .
nearly all were well-to-do , and many served the city and the state as aldermen and members of the legislature .
during the revolution they followed under washington 's banner , and their purses were wide open to further the cause of independence .
<name> <name> the elder was a merchant and banker ; a man broad in his views and filled with the spirit of genuine philanthropy .
he founded one of the hospitals of the city and was at one time chairman of the state board of charities .
a story is told of him which is probably true .
one day <name> loring brace came to him for financial assistance in establishing homes for the little <unk> of the city .
" i <name> see what i can do , " said mr. <name> .
" but you know that just at present i am busy with other charitable works . "
" i know that , " said mr. brace .
" but what i ask for is very much needed .
the <unk> and poor , homeless newsboys have no shelter . "
the next day , when returning from the establishment in which he was a partner , mr. <name> came upon a newsboy sitting on a doorstep , crying bitterly .
" what is the matter , my little man ? "
he asked .
" i lost me money ; it dropped down into de sewer hole ! "
sobbed the ragged urchin .
" every cent of it is gone . "
mr. <name> questioned the lad and found out that the boy had no home and that his only relative was a <unk> who was hardly ever sober .
he gave the lad some money to replace the amount lost , and the next day sent word to mr. brace that he would do all he possibly could toward establishing the <unk> ' shelters that were so much needed .
the <unk> lodging house of new york city is one of the results of mr. <unk> practical charities .
he also did much to give criminals a helping hand when they came from prison , stating that that was the one time in their lives when they most needed help , for fear they might slip back into their previous bad habits .
in 1853 <name> <name> the elder married miss <name> bullock , of <unk> , <unk> county , <name> .
miss bullock was the daughter of <name> <name> s. bullock and a direct descendant of <unk> bullock , the first governor of <name> .
it <name> thus be seen that the future president had both northern and southern blood in his make-up , and it may be added here that during the terrible civil war his relatives were to be found both in the union and the confederate ranks .
mrs. <name> was a strong southern <unk> , and when a certain gathering , during the civil war , was in progress at the <name> city home , she insisted upon displaying a confederate flag at one of the windows .
" i am afraid it <name> make trouble , " said mr. <name> ; and he was right .
soon a mob began to gather in the street , clamoring that the flag be taken down .
" i shall not take it down , " said mrs. <name> , bravely .
" the room is mine , and the flag is mine .
i love it , and nobody shall touch it .
explain to the crowd that i am a southern woman and that i love my country . "
there being no help for it , mr. <name> went to the front door and explained matters as best he could .
a few in the crowd grumbled , but when mrs. <name> came to the window and looked down on the gathering , one after another the men went away , and she and her flag remained unmolested .
<name> <name> , the future president , was one of a family of four .
he had a brother <name> and two sisters .
his brother was several years younger than himself , but much more robust , and would probably have lived many years and have distinguished himself , had he not met death in a railroad accident while still a young man .
in the years when <name> <name> was a boy , new york city was not what it is to-day .
the neighborhood in which he lived was , as i have already mentioned , a fashionable one , and the same may be said of many other spots near to union square , where tall business blocks were yet unknown .
the boys and girls loved to play in the little park and on the avenue , and here it was that the rather delicate schoolboy grew to know <name> <unk> , who lived in fourteenth street and who was his school companion .
little did they dream in those days , as they played together , that one day he would be president and she his loving wife , the mistress of the white house .
mr. <name> was a firm believer in public institutions , and he did not hesitate to send his children to the public schools , especially his boys , that they might come in direct personal contact with the great outside world .
so to a near-by institution of learning <name> and <name> trudged day after day , with their <unk> under their arms , just as thousands of other schoolboys are doing to-day .
but in those days there were few experiments being tried in the schools , and <name> training and the like were unknown .
the boys were well grounded in reading , writing , and arithmetic , as well as spelling , history , and geography , and there was great excitement when a " <unk> " was in progress , to see who could spell the rest of the class or the gathering down .
it is said upon good authority that <name> <name> was a model scholar from the start .
he loved to read cooper 's " <unk> tales , " and works of travel , and preferred books above anything else .
but when he found that constant studying was ruining his constitution , he determined to build himself up physically as well as mentally .
in the summer time the family often went to the old <name> " out of town " mansion on long island .
this was called " tranquillity , " a fine large place near oyster bay , set in a grove of beautiful trees .
the journey to " tranquillity " was in those days a tedious one , but the <name> children did not mind it , and once at the old place they were certain of a good time so long as their vacation lasted .
here it was that <name> <name> learned to ride on horseback and how to handle a gun .
and here , too , the boys would go boating , fishing , and bathing , to their hearts ' content .
mr. <name> <name> the elder was a member of the dutch reformed church , and the religious teaching of his children was not neglected .
at an early age the future president became a member of that denomination and has remained a member ever since .
the church was on the east side , and had <unk> pews , and here were delivered sermons that were as long as they were full of strength and wisdom .
that these sermons had their full effect upon the future president is shown by his addresses delivered before the young men 's <name> association of new york city and a church community of the west , years later .
in addressing the young men 's <name> association mr. <name> , who was then governor of the state , said :  " the vice of envy is not only dangerous , but also a mean vice , for it is always a confession of inferiority .
it may provoke conduct which <name> be fruitful of wrong to others ; and it must cause misery to the man who feels it .
it <name> not be any the less fruitful of wrong and misery if , as is often the case with evil motives , it adopts some <unk> alias .
the truth is , gentlemen , that each one of us has in him certain passions and instincts which , if they gain the upper hand in his soul , would mean that the wild beast had come uppermost in him .
envy , malice , and hatred are such passions , and they are just as bad if directed against a class or group of men as if directed against an individual . "
golden words , well worth remembering .
a person who believes in them with all his heart can not go far wrong in his actions , no matter what his station in life .
chapter ii <unk> <name>  goes to harvard college  member of many clubs  death of mr. <name>  anecdotes of college life the instincts of the <name> must have been born in <name> <name> .
his first gun was given to him when he was ten years of age , and for the time being his books and his studies were forgotten , and he devoted his whole time and attention to shooting at a target set up in the garden of the country home and in going out with the older folks after such small game as were to be found in that vicinity .
the horses on the place were his pets , and he knew the peculiarities of each as well as did the man who cared for them .
riding and driving came to him as naturally as breathing , and the fact that a steed was <unk> did not <unk> him .
" my father often drove <unk> , " he has said .
" i liked very much to go with him , and i liked to drive , too . "
<name> <name> 's schoolboy days were not far out of the ordinary .
he studied hard , and if he failed in a lesson he did his best to make it up the next time .
it is well said that there is no <name> road to learning , and even a future president must study just as hard as his classmates if he wants to keep up with them .
sometimes he was absent from school on account of sickness , and then it was a sharp struggle to keep from dropping behind .
" in those days nobody expected <name> <name> to amount to a great deal , " some one has said .
" he was thin , pale , and delicate , and suffered with his eyes .
but he pulled through , and when he took to athletics , it was wonderful how he got stronger . "
by his intimate companions , and indeed by nearly everybody who knew him , he was called <name> , and this nickname clung to him when he went forth into the great world to become a governor and a president .
how the nickname came first into use is not known .
since those schoolboy days mr. <name> has been asked this question :  " what did you expect to be , or dream of being , when you were a boy ? "
" i do not recollect that i dreamed at all or planned at all , " was the answer .
" i simply obeyed the injunction , <unk> thy hand <unk> to do , do that with all thy might , ' and so i took up what came along as it came . "
in 1876 , while the great centennial exhibition was being held at philadelphia in commemoration of one hundred years of national <name> , <name> <name> took up his residence at cambridge , massachusetts , and became a student at harvard college .
during the previous year his health had been poor indeed , but now he had taken hold of himself in <name> .
" i determined to be strong and well , and did everything to make myself so , " he has said .
" by the time i entered harvard i was able to take part in whatever sports i liked . "
as perhaps some of my readers know , harvard college ( now termed a university ) is the oldest and largest institution of learning in the united states .
it was founded in <unk> , and among its graduates numbered <name> <name> adams , sixth president of our country .
the college proper is located in cambridge , but some of the attached schools are in boston .
<name> <name> was <name> enough to have lived in elegant style while at harvard , but he preferred unostentatious quarters , and took two rooms in the home of <unk> .
h. richardson , at what was then no .
16 and is now no .
88 winthrop street .
the residence is a neat and comfortable one , standing on the southwest corner of winthrop and <unk> streets .
the young student had two rooms on the second floor ,  one of good size , used for a study , and a small bedroom .
in the whole four years he was at the college he occupied these rooms , and he spent a great deal of time in fixing them up to suit his own peculiar taste .
on the walls were all sorts of pictures and photographs , along with <unk> and <unk> , and the horns of wild animals .
on a shelf rested some birds which he had himself stuffed , and books were everywhere .
[ illustration : house in which <name> <name> <unk> while at harvard . ]
" it was a regular den , and typical of <name> to the last degree , " a student of those times has said .
" he had his gun there and his fishing <name> , and often spoke of using them .
he was noted for trying to get at the bottom of things , and i remember him well on one occasion when i found him with a stuffed bird in one hand and a natural history in the other , trying to decide if the description in the volume covered the specimen before him . "
when <name> graduated from college , he was one of a very few that took honors , and the subject of his essay was natural history .
how his love of natural history continued <name> be shown later when we see him as a ranchman and <name> of the west .
<name> <name> had decided to make the most of himself , and while at harvard scarcely a moment was wasted .
if he was not studying , he was in the gymnasium or on the field , doing what he could to make himself strong .
he was a firm believer in the saying that a sound body makes a sound mind , and he speedily became a good boxer , <unk> , <unk> , and runner .
he wrestled a great deal , and of this sport says :  " i enjoyed it immensely and never injured myself .
i think i was a good deal of a <unk> , and though i never won a championship , yet more than once i won my trial heats and got into the final rounds . "
at running he was equally good .
" i remember once we had a stiff run out into the country , " said a <unk> .
" <name> was behind at the start , but when all of the others got played out he forged ahead , and in the end he beat us by several minutes .
but he never <unk> about it .
you see , it was n't his style . "
with all his other sports , and his studying , the young <unk> did not give up his love for driving .
he had a good horse and a fancy cart ,  one of the elevated sort with large wheels ,  and in this turnout he was seen many a day , driving wherever it pleased him to go .
sometimes he would get on the road with other students , and then there was bound to be more or less racing .
with a strong love for natural history it was not surprising that he joined the natural history club of the college , and of this he was one of the most active members .
he also joined the athletic association , of which he was a steward , and the <name> club , the rifle corps , the <unk> .
society , and the finance club .
in his senior year he became a member of the <unk> club , the hasty pudding , and the <name> <name> <unk> club , and also one of the editors of a college paper called the advocate .
on sundays he taught a class of boys , first in a mission school , and then in a <unk> <name> school .
it was a life full of planning , full of study , and full of work , and it suited <name> <name> to the last degree .
as he grew older his love of natural history was supplemented by a love for the history of nations , and particularly by a love of the history of his own country .
the war of 1812 interested him intensely , and before he graduated he laid plans for writing a history of this war , which should go into all the details of the memorable naval conflicts .
it was while in his third year at harvard that <name> <name> suffered the first heavy affliction of his life .
on february 9 , 1878 , his father died .
it was a cruel blow to the family , and one from which the faithful wife scarcely recovered .
the son at harvard felt his loss greatly , and it was some time before he felt able to resume his studies .
the elder <name> 's work as a <unk> was well known , and many gathered at his bier to do him honor , while the public journals were filled with <unk> of the man .
the poor mourned bitterly that he was gone , and even the newsboys were filled with regret over his taking away .
in speaking of his parent , president <name> once said : " i can remember seeing him going down broadway , staid and respectable business man that he was , with a poor sick kitten in his coat pocket , which he had picked up in the street . "
such a man could not but have a heart overflowing with goodness .
while at college <name> <name> often showed that self-reliance for which he has since become famous .
to every study that he took up he applied himself closely , and if he was not at the head of the class , he was by no means near the foot .
when he was sure of a thing , no amount of argument could convince him that he was wrong , and he did not hesitate at times to enter into a discussion even with some of the professors over him .
although a close student , and also a good <unk> athlete , <name> <name> did not forget his social opportunities .
boston was but a short distance from his rooms in cambridge , and thither he often went to visit the people he had met or to whom he had letters of introduction .
he was always welcome , for his manner was a winning one , and he usually had something to tell that was of interest  something of what he had seen or done , of the next <unk> or <unk> game , of the coming boat races , of his driving or exploring , or of how he had added a new stuffed bird to his collection , or a new lizard , and of how a far-away friend had sent him a big turtle as a souvenir of an ocean trip in the south seas .
there is a story that this big turtle got loose one night and alarmed the entire household by crawling through the hallway , looking for a pond or <unk> in which to wallow .
at first the turtle was mistaken for a burglar , but he soon revealed himself by his angry snapping , and it was hard work making him a prisoner once more .
chapter iii marries miss <name> <name>  travels in europe  bold <unk>  studying law in new york  elected to the assembly  personal encounter with the enemy it was a proud and happy day for <name> <name> when , in the summer of 1880 , he was graduated from harvard .
he took scholarly as well as social honors , and came forth a <unk> beta <unk> man .
his <unk> wished him well , and his family greeted him most affectionately .
yet with it all there was just a bit of melancholy in this breaking away from a place that had been as a second home to him for four long years .
the students were scattering to the four points of the compass , and he might never see some of them again .
but others were there whom he was to meet later , and who were destined to march under him up the <unk> slopes of san <name> in far-away cuba .
but at that time there was no thought of war and carnage , only good-fellowship , with addresses and orations , music , flying flags , and huge bonfires and fireworks at night .
happy college days were they , never to be forgotten .
[ illustration : <name> <name> at graduation , 1880 . ]
while a student at harvard , <name> <name> had become intimately acquainted with miss <name> <name> , of boston , a beautiful girl who was a member of an aristocratic family of that city .
the young college student was a frequent visitor at the home of the <unk> , and on <name> 23 , 1880 , the two were married .
it had been decided that <name> <name> should travel in europe after <unk> .
his father had left the family well provided for , so there was no rush to get into something whereby a living might be earned .
yet <name> <name> had long since determined not to be an <unk> .
he would travel and improve his mind , and then settle down to that for which he seemed best fitted .
to europe then he went , accompanied by his bride , to study a little and to visit the <name> galleries and museums , the palaces of kings and queens , and the many great cities of that continent .
he travelled through italy , switzerland , germany , <name> , and the british isles , taking note of everything he saw and comparing it with what he had seen in his own country .
when in lower europe , the spirit of adventure seized him , and he climbed those lofty mountains of the alps , the jungfrau and the matterhorn , and for those deeds of daring was made a member of the alpine club of london .
it may be mentioned here that climbing the mountains mentioned is a very difficult feat , and that more than one traveller has lost his life in such attempts .
the peaks are covered with snow and ice ; the path from one <name> to the next is narrow and uncertain , and a fall into some dark and fearful hollow usually means death .
but the danger only urged <name> <name> on , and added zest to the undertaking .
he was intensely interested in all he saw , both in europe proper and in the british isles , but wrote that he was glad to get back home again , among his own people .
to him there was no country like <name> , the land of golden opportunity , as one of our most noted writers has called it .
in europe there was more or less a lack of personal <name> ; here a man could try to make what he pleased of himself , be it cobbler or president .
the young college graduate had an uncle in new york , named <name> b. <name> , who was a well-known lawyer .
on his return to this country <name> <name> entered his uncle 's office , and likewise took up the study of law at columbia university , attending the lectures given by professor <name> .
here again his search after what he termed " bottom facts " came to light , and he is well remembered as a member of the law class because of the way he frequently asked questions and called for explanations  accepting nothing as a fact until it was perfectly clear in his own mind .
the interruptions did not always suit the professor or the other students , yet they were often the means of clearing up a point that was hazy to many others who had not the courage to thrust forth their inquiries as did <name> <name> .
" he wants to know it all , " said one student , in disgust .
" well , never mind ; i wish i knew it all , " answered another .
" i guess he knows what he is doing . "
and in this he was right ; <name> <name> knew exactly what he was trying to accomplish .
the young man was now twenty-three years of age , broad-shouldered , and in much better health than ever before .
he had not abandoned his athletic training , and would often run out to the old home at oyster bay for a tramp into the woods or on a hunting tour .
while still studying law , <name> <name> entered politics by taking an active part in a republican primary .
he lived in the twenty-third assembly district of the state .
the district included a great number of <name> and influential citizens , and on that account was called the " <name> back district . "
" let us put up young <name> for assembly , " said one of the politicians .
" he 's a clever fellow . "
" that may be , " said another .
" but i do n't know that we can manage him .
he seems a fellow who wants his own way . "
" yes , he 'll want his own way , but i reckon that way <name> be the right way , " put in a third speaker .
no sooner had <name> <name> 's name been mentioned as a possible candidate than there was a storm of opposition from some politicians who had in the past ruled the district with a <name> of iron .
it was a republican district , so that the contest for the place was entirely in the primary .
" if he is nominated and elected , our power <name> be gone , " they told themselves ; and set to work without delay to throw the nomination into the hands of somebody else .
<name> <name> suspected what was going on , but he said nothing to those who opposed him .
with his friends he was very <name> , and told them that if he was nominated he would do his best to win the election and serve them honestly in the legislature .
his <unk> won him many friends , and when the primary was held , those who had opposed him were chagrined to see him win the nomination with votes to spare .
some at once predicted that he would not be elected .
" those who opposed him at the primary <name> not vote for him , " they said .
" they would rather help the democrats . "
but this prediction proved false .
at the election <name> <name> was elected with a good majority .
it was his first battle in the political arena and if he felt proud over it , who can blame him ?
the state capitol of new york is , as my young readers must know , at albany , on the upper hudson , and hither the young assemblyman journeyed .
the <unk> poured in from all over the state , and were made up of all sorts and conditions of men , including bankers , farmers , merchants , contractors , liquor dealers , and even <unk> .
many of these men were thoroughly honest , but there were others who were there for gain only , and who cared little for the passing of just laws .
the party to which <name> <name> belonged was in the minority , so that the young assemblyman found he would have to struggle hard if he expected to be heard at all .
but the thoughts of such a struggle only put him on his mettle , and he plunged in with a vigor that astonished his opponents and caused great delight to his friends .
" he is fearless , " said one who had voted for him .
" he <name> make things warm for those who do n't want to act on the square . "
and he certainly did make it warm , until a certain class grew to fear and hate him to such a degree that they plotted to do him bodily harm .
" he has got to learn that he must mind his own business , " was the way one of these <unk> reasoned .
" but what can we do ? "
asked another .
" he 's as sharp on the floor of the assembly as a steel trap . "
" we 'll get stubby to brush up against him , " said a third .
stubby was a bar-room loafer who had been at one time something of a <unk> .
he was a thoroughly unprincipled fellow , and it was known that he would do almost anything for money .
" sure , i 'll fix him , " said stubby .
" you just leave him to me and see how i polish him off . "
the <unk> and their tool met at the <unk> house , an old-fashioned hotel at which politicians in and around the capital were wont to congregate , and waited for the young assemblyman .
<name> was not long in putting in an appearance and was soon in deep discussion with some friends .
" watch him , stubby , " said one of the young assemblyman 's enemies .
" don't let him get away from you to-night . "
" i have me eye on him , " answered stubby .
<name> was on the way to the buffet of the hotel when the crowd , with stubby in front , pushed against him rudely .
the young assemblyman stepped back and viewed those before him fearlessly .
" say , what do <name> mean , running into me that way ? "
demanded stubby , insolently .
as he spoke he aimed a savage blow at <name> <name> .
but the young assemblyman had not forgotten how to box , and he dodged with an agility that was astonishing .
" this fellow needs to be taught a lesson , " <name> <name> told himself , and then and there he proceeded to administer the lesson in a manner that stubby never forgot .
he went down flat on his back , and when he got up , he went down again , with a bleeding nose and one eye all but closed .
seeing this , several leaped in to his assistance , but it was an ill-fated move , for <name> turned on them also , and down they went , too ; and then the encounter came to an end , with <name> <name> the <name> .
" and that was n't the end of it , " said one , who witnessed the affair .
" after it was over young <name> was as smiling as ever .
he walked straight over to some of his enemies who had been watching the mix-up from a distance and told them very plainly that he knew how the attack had originated , and he was much obliged to them , for he had n't enjoyed himself so much for a year .
phew !
but were n't those fellows mad !
and was n't stubby mad when he learned that they had set him against one of the best <unk> harvard ever turned out ?
but after that you can make sure they treated <name> with respect and gave him a wide berth . "
chapter iv <name> <name> and governor <name>  good work as an assemblyman  some measures pushed through  birth of <name> <name>  death of mr. <name> 's mother the career of an assemblyman is not generally an interesting one , but mr. <name> managed to extract not a little pleasure and also some profit from it .
the experience was just what he needed to fit himself for the larger positions he was , later on , to occupy .
one happening is of peculiar interest to note .
while <name> <name> was a member of the assembly , <name> <name> became governor of the state .
mr. <name> was a democrat , while mr. <name> was a republican , yet the two future presidents of the united states became warm friends ,  a friendship that has endured to the present day .
it is said that the friendship started in rather a peculiar manner .
there was at the time a measure before the assembly to reduce the fare of the elevated roads in new york city from ten cents to five cents .
after a great deal of talking , the <name> passed the assembly and then the senate , and went to the governor for his signature .
much to the surprise of the general public governor <name> <unk> the <name> , stating that when the capitalists had built the elevated roads they had understood that the fare was to be ten cents , and that it was not right to deprive them of their profits .
at once those who wanted the measure to become a law decided to pass it over the governor 's head .
when this attempt was made , <name> <name> got up boldly and said he could not again vote for the <name>  that he was satisfied that governor <name> 's view of the matter was correct .
" these people would not have put their money in the elevated railroads had they not been assured that the fare was to be ten cents , " said he .
" we are under obligation to them , and we must keep our promises . "
and so the <name> fell through .
it was not in itself right that the fare should be ten cents , and it has long since been reduced to five cents , but it shows that <name> <name> was bound to do what was right and just , according to the dictates of his own conscience , and this won for him many friends , even among those who had opposed him politically .
in a work of this kind , intended mainly for the use of young people , it is not necessary to do more than glance at the work which <name> <name> accomplished while a member of the new york assembly .
he made a close study of the various political offices of new york county and discovered that many <unk> were drawing large sums of money in the shape of fees for which they were doing hardly any work .
this he considered unfair , and by dint of hard labor helped to pass a law placing such offices on the salary list , making a saving to the county of probably half a million dollars a year .
one of the best things done by <name> <name> at that time was the support given by him to a civil service law for the state .
up to that time <unk> was largely in the hands of the party which happened to be in power .
" this is all wrong , " said the young assemblyman .
" a clerk or anybody else doing his duty faithfully should not be thrown out as soon as there is a political change . "
the new law was passed , and this was the beginning of what is commonly called the merit system , whereby a large number of those who work for the state are judged solely by their <unk> and not by their political beliefs .
this system has since been extended to other states and also to <unk> under the national government .
another important measure pushed through the assembly by <name> <name> was what was known as the <unk> charter for new york city , giving to the mayor certain rights which in the past had rested in the board of aldermen .
this measure was defeated during <name> 's second term of office , but in 1884 he pressed it with such force that it overcame all opposition and became a law .
many have considered this victory his very best work .
by those who knew him at this time he is described as having almost a boyish figure , <name> face , clear , penetrating eyes , and a smile of good-natured friendship and dry humor .
when he talked it was with an earnestness that could not be mistaken .
by those who were especially bitter against him he was sometimes called a dude and a silk stocking , but to these insinuations he paid no attention , and after the encounter at the <unk> house his opponents were decidedly more careful as to how they addressed him .
" take him all the way through he was generally even tempered , " one has said who met him at that time .
" but occasionally there was a flash from his eye that made his opponent draw back in quick order .
he would stand a good deal , but there were some things he would n't take , and they knew it .
one thing is certain , after he was in the assembly for a few months everybody knew perfectly that to come to him with any <name> that was the least bit shady was a waste of time and effort .
<name> would n't stand for it a minute . "
in those days <name> <name> did not give up his habits of athletic exercise , and nearly every day he could be seen taking long walks in the country around albany .
in the meantime his " naval war of 1812 " was well under way , but he could spare only a few hours occasionally to complete his manuscript .
his married life had thus far been a happy one , and its <name> was greatly increased by the birth of his daughter <name> .
as <name> be seen later , mr. <name> is what is called a family man , and he took great comfort in this new addition to his little household .
but his happiness was short-lived , for in 1884 , when the daughter was but a baby , the beloved wife died , and the little one had to be given over to the care of the grandparents in boston .
not many months later mr. <name> 's mother died also , heaping additional sorrow upon his head .
with the conclusion of his third term in the assembly <name> <name> 's work as a member of that body came to an end .
if he had made some enemies , he had made more friends , and he was known as an ardent supporter of reform in all branches of politics .
in recognition of his ability he was chosen as a <unk> to the republican convention brought together to nominate a candidate to succeed president <name> .
at that time <name> g. <name> from maine had served many years in the united states senate , and it was thought that he would surely be both nominated and elected .
but many were opposed to <name> , thinking he would not support such reform measures as they wished to see advanced , and among this number was <name> <name> .
" we must nominate mr. <unk> , " said the young <unk> , and did his best for the gentleman in question .
" it can not be done , " said another delegate .
the convention met at exposition hall in chicago , and mr. <name> was placed on the committee on resolutions .
it was a <name> convention , and ballot after ballot had to be taken before a nomination could be secured .
<name> led from the start , with senator <unk> a fairly close second .
" if <name> is nominated , he <name> be defeated , " said more than one .
at last came the deciding vote , and <name> g. <name> was put up at the head of the ticket , with <name> a. <name> for vice-president .
at once <name> clubs were organized all over the country , and the republican party did all in its power to elect its candidate .
he was called the plumed knight , and many political clubs wore plumes in his honor when on parade .
in the meantime the democrats had nominated <name> <name> .
the fight was exceedingly bitter up to the very evening of election day .
when the votes were counted , it was found that <name> had been defeated by a large majority , and that <name> <name> , <name> 's old friend , had won the highest gift in the hands of the nation .
his work at the convention in chicago was <name> <name> 's first entrance into national affairs , and his speeches on that occasion <name> not be readily forgotten .
it was here that he came into contact with <name> <name> , with whom , sixteen years later , he was to run on the same ticket .
the records of that convention show that on one occasion <name> spoke directly after <name> .
thus were these two drawn together at that early day without knowing or dreaming that one was to succeed the other to the presidency .
but though <name> <name> was disappointed over the nomination made at chicago , he did not desert his party .
instead he did all he could to lead them to victory , until the death of his mother caused him to withdraw temporarily from public affairs .
[ illustration : signature : <name> <name> <name> ] chapter v <name> <name> as a ranchman and <name> in the bad lands  bringing down his first buffalo  rattlesnakes , and a wild goose <name> <name> had now published his " naval history of the war of 1812 , " and it had created a decidedly favorable opinion among those critics who were best able to judge of the production .
it is an authoritative work , and is to-day in the library of nearly every american war-ship afloat , as well as in numerous government libraries in this country , as at washington , west point , and annapolis , and also in leading libraries of england .
being out of politics the young author thought of taking up his pen once more .
but he was restless by nature , and the loss of his wife and his mother still weighed heavily upon him .
so he took himself to the west , to where the little missouri river flows in winding form through what are called the bad lands of north <name> .
here , on the edge of the cattle country , <name> <name> had become possessed of two ranches , one called the <unk> and the other chimney butte .
both were located by the river , which during the dry season was hardly of any depth at all , but which during the heavy rains , or during the spring <unk> , became a roaring torrent .
at one of these ranches <name> <name> settled down for the time being , to rough it in hunting and raising cattle .
when the weather would not permit of his going abroad , or when the mood of the author seized him , he wrote .
as a result of these experiences he has given us a delightful work called " the hunting trips of a ranchman , " first published in 1885 , giving his adventures among the cattle and while on the hunt , sometimes alone and sometimes in company with the rude but honest cow <unk> and <unk> who surrounded him .
mr. <name> has described the ranch at which he lived for the greater part of his time as a long , low , <unk> house of hewn logs , clean and neat , and with many rooms .
it faced the river , and in front was a long , low veranda , where one might idle on a clear , warm day to his heart 's content .
inside , the main room contained a shelf full of the owner 's favorite outdoor books and the walls half-a-dozen pet pictures .
rifles and <unk> stood handy in corners , and on pegs and deer horns <name> overcoats of wolf or coon skin and gloves of otter or beaver .
that <name> <name> was a close observer of all that occurred around him is proved by his writings .
with great minuteness he has described his life at the ranch home and while in the saddle , both in <name> and summer , telling of his experiences while rounding up cattle and while bringing down <unk> and larger game of various kinds .
he likewise describes the trained hunters he has met at different seasons of the year , and tells of what they have done or were trying to do .
at this time his favorite horse was a steed called <unk> .
but when on a round-up of cattle , many ponies were taken along , so that a fresh mount could be had at any time .
it was a breezy , free life , and to it our president undoubtedly owes the rugged constitution that he possesses to-day .
his observations led him to make many investigations concerning the smaller wild animals near his ranches and the larger beasts to be found farther off .
the tales which were told to him by other ranchmen and hunters he always took " with a grain of salt , " and he soon reached the conclusion that many of the <unk> mighty hunters were only such in name , and had brought down quantities of game only in years gone by when such game was plentiful and could be laid low without much trouble .
once when a man told him he had brought down a certain beast at four hundred yards , <name> measured the distance and found it to be less than half that .
" you could n't fool him on much , " said one of the persons who met him about that time .
" he would take precious little for granted .
he wanted to know the how of everything , and he was n't satisfied until he did know . "
regarding his own powers as a <name> at that time , mr. <name> is very modest .
he says his eyesight was rather poor , and his hand not over steady , so that " drawing a bead " on anything was not easy .
yet he went into the sport with much enthusiasm , and if at times he came back at nightfall empty-handed , he did not complain , and he was almost certain to have something interesting to tell of what he had seen .
<name> <name> had been in this territory before , although not to remain any great length of time .
once he had come out to hunt buffalo , no easy thing to do , since this game was growing <unk> every day .
he had a guide named ferris , who was not particularly struck with the appearance of the pale young man , plainly dressed , whom he met at the railroad station .
" i sized him up as not being able to endure a long trip after a buffalo , " said the guide , in speaking afterward of the meeting .
" he was well mounted , but he looked as if he might play out before the sun went down . "
but in this the guide was mistaken .
<name> proved that he could ride as well as anybody .
the first night out found the hunters about thirty miles from any settlement .
they went into camp on the open prairie , <unk> their horses with ropes fastened to their saddles , which they used as pillows .
all went well for an hour or two , when the improvised pillow was jerked from beneath <name> <name> 's head , and he heard his horse bounding away in the distance .
" wolves ! "
cried the guide .
" they have frightened our horses ! "
so it proved ; and the hunters lost no time in reaching for their firearms .
but the wolves kept their distance , and soon <name> <name> was running after the horses , which , after a good deal of trouble , he secured and brought back .
after that the guide no longer looked on him as a " <unk> . "
" a <unk> , " said he , " would have been scared to death .
but <name> <name> was as cool as a cucumber through it all  as if the happening was n't in the least out of the ordinary . "
for several days the hunters remained on the prairie looking for buffalo , but without success .
they were on the point of turning back when the guide noticed that the horses were growing uneasy .
" some big game at hand , " he announced .
" come on to yonder <unk> and see if i am not right . "
with great caution the hunters advanced to the <unk> the guide had mentioned .
dismounting , they crept forward in the shelter of the brushwood , and there , true enough , resting at his ease was a great buffalo bull .
" hit him where the patch of red shows on his side , " whispered the guide , and <name> nodded to show that he understood .
with care and coolness he took aim and fired , and the buffalo bull leaped up and staggered forward with the blood streaming from his mouth and nose .
" shall i give him another ? "
was the question asked , but before it could be answered the buffalo bull gave a plunge and fell dead .
rattlesnakes are rather unpleasant reptiles to deal with , and <name> <name> has shown his bravery by the way in which he speaks of them in his accounts of outdoor life .
he says to a man wearing alligator boots there is little danger , for the <unk> of the reptile can not go through the leather , and the snake rarely strikes as high as one 's knee .
but he had at least one experience with a rattlesnake not readily forgotten .
he was out on a hunt for antelope .
the sage-brush in which he was concealing himself was so low that he had to crawl along flat on his breast , pushing himself forward with hands and feet as best he could .
he was almost on the antelope when he heard a warning whirr close at his side , and glancing hastily in that direction , saw the reptile but a few feet away , coiled up and ready to attack .
it was a thrilling and critical moment , and had the young <name> leaped up he might have been dangerously if not fatally struck .
but by instinct he backed away silently and moved off in another direction through the brush .
the rattlesnake did not follow , although it kept its piercing eyes on the <name> as long as possible .
after the antelope stalk was over , <name> came back to the spot , made a careful search , and , watching his chance , fired on the rattlesnake , killing it instantly .
in those days <name> <name> met colonel <name> <name> , commonly known as " buffalo <name> , " and many other celebrated characters of the west .
he never grew tired of listening to the stories these old trappers , hunters , scouts , and <unk> had to tell , and some of these stories he afterward put into print , and they have made excellent reading .
during many of his hunting expeditions at that time <name> <name> was accompanied by his foreman , a good shot and <unk> ranchman named <unk> .
<unk> had been in the west but five years , but the life fitted him exactly , and in him <name> the ranchman and <name> found a companion exactly to his liking , fearless and <unk> to the last degree .
as perhaps most of my young readers know , wild geese are generally brought down with a shot-gun , but in the bad lands it was not unusual to bring them down with a rifle , provided the <name> was quick and accurate enough in his aim .
one morning , just before <name> , <name> <name> was riding along the edge of a creek when he heard a <unk> that he knew must come from some geese , and he determined if possible to lay one low .
it was easy work to dismount and crawl to the edge of the creek .
but a fog lay over the water , and he could see the geese but indistinctly .
leaving the creek bank , he ran silently to where the watercourse made a turn and then crawled forward in the brush .
soon the fog lifted once more , and he saw the geese resting on the water close to the bend .
he fired quickly and brought down the largest of the flock , while the others lost no time in disappearing .
it was a good fat goose and made excellent eating .
chapter <name> grouse and other small game  the scotchman and the skunk  caught in a hailstorm on the prairie  bringing down <unk> deer it can not be said that <name> <name> 's venture as a ranchman was a very successful one , and it is doubtful if he expected to make much money out of it .
he lost nothing in a financial way , and there is no doubt but that the experience was of great benefit to him .
in this <unk> he met all sorts and conditions of men , and grew to know them thoroughly .
in the past his dealings had been almost entirely with people of large cities and towns , and with men of learning and large business affairs ; here he fell in with the wildest kind of cowboys and frontiersmen .
some he soon found were not fit to be associated with , but the majority proved as honest and hard-working fellows as could be met with anywhere .
many of these loved the young " boss " from the start , and when , years later , the war with spain broke out , and there was a call to arms , not a few of them insisted upon joining the rough riders just to be near <name> <name> once more .
around the ranches owned by <name> <name> there were more or less grouse of the <unk> variety .
as this sort of game made excellent eating , ranchmen and regular hunters did not hesitate to bring them down at every opportunity .
one afternoon <name> <name> left his ranch to visit the shack of one of his <unk> , about thirty-five miles down the river .
it was a cold , clear day , and he was finely mounted on a <unk> pony .
he writes that he was after grouse , hoping to get quite a number of them .
he had trusted to reach the shack long before sundown , but the way was bad , over bottoms covered with thin ice and snow , and soon darkness came on , leaving him practically lost in the cottonwoods that lined the watercourse .
what to do the young ranchman did not know , and it is safe to say that he wished himself heartily out of the difficulty .
it was so dark he could not see three yards ahead of him , and it was only by the merest accident that he struck the shack at last , and then he found it empty , for the <unk> had gone off elsewhere on business .
so far <name> had seen no game , so he was without food , and what made matters worse , the larder of the shack proved to be empty .
all he had with him was a little package of tea .
it was a dismal outlook truly , and especially on such a cold night .
but firewood was at hand , and after turning his pony loose to shift for itself , the future president of our country started up housekeeping for himself by lighting a fire , bringing in some water from under the ice of the river , and brewing himself a good , strong cup of tea !
it was not a very nourishing meal , but it was all he had , and soon after that he went to sleep , trusting for better luck in the morning .
he was up almost before daybreak , and my young readers can rest assured that by that time his appetite was decidedly keen .
listening intently , he could hear the grouse drumming in the woods close by .
" i must have some of them , and that directly , " he told himself , and rifle in hand lost no time in making his way to the woods .
by keeping out of sight behind the brushwood he managed to get quite close to the game , and so brought down one after another until he had five .
such success was a great satisfaction to him , and returning to the shack he fixed himself a breakfast of broiled <unk> , to which he did full justice .
it was not all play at the ranches , and sometimes <name> <name> went out with his men to round up the cattle and help " cut out " what was his own .
this was hard work , for frequently the cattle did not want to be separated from the beasts belonging to another ranchman .
more than once an angry cow or a bull would charge , and then there would be a lively scramble on <unk> or on foot to get out of the way .
sometimes , too , the cattle would wander off and get lost , and then a long and hard hunt would be necessary in order to find them again .
but there was fun as well as hard work , and mr. <name> has told one story about a skunk that is sure to be remembered .
he says that <unk> were very numerous , and that they were more feared than larger animals by the cowboys because the bite was sure to bring on hydrophobia .
one night a number of the cowboys and mr. <name> were sleeping in a hut .
a skunk came along , and after a time worked its way into the hut .
it got among the pots and pans and made a noise which quickly awoke a scotchman named <name> .
thinking something was wrong , <name> struck a light , and seeing the eyes of the skunk , fired .
but his aim was bad , and the animal fled .
" what were you firing at ? "
asked half a dozen of the other cowboys .
the scotchman explained , and , satisfied that it had been a skunk , the others told him he had better leave the animal alone or there would be trouble .
nobody thought the skunk would come back , but it did , and again <name> heard it among the pots and pans .
this was too much for his scotch blood , and taking aim once more , he fired and gave the skunk a mortal wound .
at once the hut was filled with a powerful odor that made all the inmates rush for the open air .
" now see what you have done ! "
cried several , indignantly .
" hoot mon ! "
answered the scotchman , holding his nose tightly , " a <unk> <name> 'twould cause sec ' a <unk> ! "
and after that we may be sure that <name> let <unk> severely alone .
hunting in the summer time , or when the weather was but moderately cold , was well enough , but hunting in the dead of <name> was quite a different thing .
then the thermometer would frequently drop to thirty and forty degrees below zero , and there would be a cutting " <unk> " fit to freeze the very marrow in one 's bones .
seldom was there much snow , but when it came , it caused a veritable blizzard , during which neither man nor beast felt like stirring out .
it was during such weather that <name> <name> once had the tip of his nose and one cheek frozen  something that caused him not a little pain and trouble for a long time afterward .
it was in those dreary days that the logs were piled high in the broad fireplace of the ranch home , and <name> <name> spent his days in reading and studying , in writing letters to his friends and relatives , and in <unk> some of the hunting sketches that have won him literary fame .
one day , early in the <name> , <name> <name> and his foreman went out to see if they could not bring in two <unk> deer which had been seen in the vicinity of the ranch the day before .
one of the deer , a large <name> , had been shot in the ankle by the foreman , so the beginning of the trail was easy to follow .
the <name> and his mate had gone into a thicket , and it was likely that there the pair had spent the night .
" we 'll have our own trouble finding the tracks again , " said the foreman .
and so it proved ; for during the night some cattle and other animals had passed in and out of the thicket , which covered a large extent of territory .
at last the hunters hit upon the right trail , and the foreman went ahead , leaving <name> to keep somewhat toward the outside of the cover .
both were wide-awake and on the alert , and presently the foreman announced that he had found the spot where the wounded <name> had passed the night .
" he is not very far from here , " said the foreman , and hardly had he said this than <name> <name> heard a cracking of fallen twigs and a breaking of the brush and lower limbs of the trees as the <name> rushed through the thicket .
he ran with all speed in the direction and took station behind a large tree .
only a few seconds passed , and then the <name> showed his head and antlers among the brushwood .
he was gazing ahead anxiously , no doubt trying to decide if it would be safe to leap into the open and run up the trail .
then he turned his gaze directly toward where <name> <name> was crouching , rifle in hand .
another instant and it would have been too late .
but just as the <unk> head was turned and he sniffed the air suspiciously , the young ranchman pulled the trigger .
" he turned his head sharply toward me as i raised the rifle , " says mr. <name> , in writing of this adventure , " and the bullet went fairly into his throat , just under the jaw , breaking his neck , and bringing him down in his tracks with hardly a kick . "
the <name> proved to be an extra fine one , and the two hunters lost no time in dressing the game and taking it to the ranch .
not wishing to go back for their horses , the two dragged the game over the snow , each taking hold of an <unk> for that purpose .
it was intensely cold , so that each of the hunters had to drag first with one hand and then with the other for fear of having his fingers frozen .
this was one of the times when the young ranchman and <name> was successful in his quest .
but mr. <name> has not hesitated to tell of the many times he has gone out on the hunt only to return empty-handed and glad enough to get back to a warm shelter and where he was sure of a good meal .
" <unk> and hunting was no bed of roses , " some one who knew him at that time has said .
" many a time he came back utterly fagged out and not a thing to show for his labor .
but he never complained , and on the contrary could generally tell a pretty good story about something he had seen or had taken note of .
in the summer he would examine the nests of birds and <unk> with great care , and i have seen him with a horned frog before him , studying every point of the creature . "
once while on the prairie the young ranchman was caught in a heavy hailstorm .
he was out with a number of others , when , with scarcely any warning , the sky began to grow dark , and the wind came up in fitful gusts .
" we must get out of this , and quick too , " said a companion .
and all pushed onward as fast as they could .
but soon the heavy fall of hail overtook them , and they were glad enough to seek even the slight shelter of a deep <unk> , where men and horses huddled close together for protection .
the <unk> came down as large as marbles , causing the horses to jump around in a fashion that was particularly dangerous to themselves and to their owners .
the time was <name> , yet the air grew very cold , and when the storm was over , some cattle were found completely benumbed .
a few had been killed , and there had likewise been great slaughter among a flock of lambs that had been driven into the bad lands the year previous .
mr. <name> tells us that the greatest number of <unk> deer he ever killed in one day was three .
he is a true sportsman in this respect and does not kill for the mere sake of killing .
those who go out just to slaughter all they possibly can are not sportsmen , but butchers .
to be sure , a <name> may have to play the butcher at times , when the meat is needed , but not otherwise .
on the occasion when the three <unk> were laid low the young ranchman and his foreman started on the hunt very early in the morning , when the bright moon was still in the sky .
it was late in november and stinging cold , so they allowed their horses to take their own pace , which was far from slow .
the course of the hunters was up the bed of a dry creek , along which they passed the still sleeping cattle and also a drove of ponies .
then they reached a spot where they left their own steeds , and , rifles in hand , hurried silently toward a great plateau which lay some distance before them .
signs of deer could be seen on every hand , and both were certain that the day 's outing would prove a grand success .
<name> <name> had separated from his companion when of a sudden he caught sight of a beautiful doe .
it was a fair shot , and dropping on one knee he took aim and fired .
but to his intense chagrin the doe bounded off and disappeared in the brushwood .
" hit anything ? "
sang out the foreman .
" i am afraid not , " was the answer .
" never mind ; better luck next time . "
and then both sank down behind a rock where they could get a good view of a hollow ahead of them .
they had been behind the rock but a short time when they heard a cracking of twigs , and a fine <unk> <name> came cautiously into view .
both fired , and the <name> rolled over , never to rise again .
then another deer came into view and both fired again , but the game was not struck and lost no time in disappearing .
" never mind ; one is n't so bad , " said <name> <name> , and his companion agreed with him .
the hunters now decided to go forward into the hollow and look for the doe <name> <name> had missed .
this was done , and soon the foreman pointed to some drops and <unk> of blood .
" must have hit her , after all , " said the foreman .
" we can take our time about following her up .
we 'll be sure to get her sooner or later . "
but locating the wounded doe proved not so easy , after all .
the trail was followed for some time , but was lost on the hard ground higher up ; and at last the two hunters agreed to look for new game .
they had lunch , and then started out nearly as fresh as before when suddenly the foreman called out :  " there 's your game all right ! "
he pointed to a clump of bushes , and running forward , both saw the doe stretched out , stiff and cold .
she had been mortally wounded , after all , much to both hunters ' gratification .
so far the hunting had been on foot , but now the hunters took again to their steeds .
mr. <name> says he was wishing for just one more shot , to see if he could not do better than before , when his wish was gratified .
just ahead a <unk> <unk> <name> leaped into view and cantered away .
after the <name> went both hunters , but <name> <name> was in the lead , and this time determined to make no miss or poor shot .
he waited until the <name> turned its side to him , then fired with especial care .
the game staggered on , then fell .
the bullet had gone clean through its body , and in a few seconds it breathed its last .
chapter vii runs for mayor of new york city  marriage to <name> <name> <unk>  hunting in the <unk> mountains  a wild <name> after three elk although <name> <name> was devoting himself to <unk> , hunting , and literary work in north <name> he had by no means given up his residence in new york or at oyster bay .
more than this , he still continued his connection with the republican party in spite of the <unk> at the last national convention .
in 1886 , while <name> <name> was still president of the united states , there was an exceedingly sharp and bitter fight in new york city over the office of mayor .
there was great discontent both in the republican and the democratic party , and nobody could tell what was going to happen on election day .
" let us put up <name> <name> , " said some of the republicans , and shortly after this <name> <name> was nominated for mayor of new york .
his regular opponent was <name> hewitt , while the <unk> put up <name> <name> , the " single tax " man , well known as the author of a book entitled " progress and poverty . "
from the very start the campaign was an exceedingly hot one , and there was a good deal of parading and <unk> .
many clubs were organized in behalf of <name> <name> , and clubs were likewise formed to support the other candidates .
the supporters of <name> <name> came from both regular parties , so political matters became very much mixed up .
" there is no show for <name> unless <name> <unk> , " said more than one old politician .
" and <name> wo n't withdraw , " added others .
and so it proved .
<name> <name> was exceptionally strong with the poorer classes , and on election day he <unk> over <unk> votes ; <unk> votes were cast for hewitt , while <name> received <unk> votes .
it was certainly a disheartening defeat , and many a man would have retired from the political field , never to show himself again .
but <name> <name> was made of sterner stuff .
he held his ground and went his way as before , resolved to do his duty as it should present itself .
it was about this time that his intimacy with miss <name> <name> <unk> was renewed .
it <name> be remembered that she had been his playmate during his earlier days around union square .
in the years that had followed she had been graduated from a young ladies ' seminary and had travelled abroad , visiting london , <name> , and other large cities .
now she was home again , and on december 2 , 1886 , she became mr. <name> 's wife .
mr. <name> 's second marriage has been a very happy one .
mrs. <name> is a loving wife and a gracious mistress of the white house .
five children have come to bless their union , of which more <name> be said later .
mrs. <name> at once took mr. <name> 's daughter <name> to her heart , and from that time to this the two have been as mother and daughter .
<name> <name> had already produced his " naval war of 1812 " and his " hunting trips of a ranchman , " both spoken of in previous pages .
a short while after he was married the second time he brought out a " life of <name> <name> , " and a year later a " life of <unk> <name> . "
in addition to this he wrote a number of articles for the magazines , and also some short stories for young folks .
all were well received and added not a little to his literary reputation .
but the <name> to be out in the open , to roam the prairie and to hunt , was in his veins , and again and again he visited his ranches in the bad lands , and took hunting trips in other directions .
sometimes he cared little or nothing for the game brought down , and at others he went on the hunt with great deliberation , for " something worth while , " as he expressed it .
how careful he could be on the latter occasions is shown by his printed views on hunting , in which he <unk> the best rifles , <unk> , and pistols to use , the best knives to <name> , how to dress with comfort , and how to follow up game , on horseback and on foot , in the open and when in the woods or in the short brush .
he has also told us much about the habits of the beasts and birds that he has hunted , showing that he followed the sport intelligently and not in the haphazard fashion of many who go out merely to get a big <unk> of game .
[ illustration : <name> <name> <name> ] hunting was not all fun in those days .
we have already related how <name> <name> was caught in a heavy hailstorm .
at another time he and his companions were caught in a <unk> ' <unk> , during which the wind blew a hurricane .
they were miles away from the ranch home , and it was utterly impossible to move in any direction .
" reckon we are booked to stay here , " said one of the cowboys , a fellow from the south .
" it 's a right smart storm , and it 's going to stay by us . "
and stay by them it did , until the party were almost out of provisions .
they got what shelter they could in something of a hollow overhung with trees and brush , but this was not very satisfactory , and all were soaked to the skin , and the blankets in which they rolled themselves at night were both wet and muddy .
" <name> <name> did n't like that wetting , and i know it , " one of the cowboys has said since .
" but he did n't grumble near as much as some of the others .
we had to take our medicine , and he took his like a man . "
there were no elk in the immediate vicinity of <name> <unk> ranches , nor were there many bears or buffaloes .
but all of these animals were to be met with further westward , and the young ranchman had been after them during a previous year 's hunting while on a trip to montana and <unk> .
at that time the destination of the party was the <unk> mountains , which were reached only after a painful and disheartening journey over a very uncertain indian trail , during which one of the ponies fell into a <unk> and broke his neck , and a mule stuck fast in a <unk> and was extricated only after hours of hard work .
" it was on the second day of our journey into the mountains that i got my first sight of elk , " says mr. <name> .
the party was on the trail leading into a broad valley , moving slowly and cautiously along through a patch of pine trees .
when the bottom of the valley was gained , mr. <name> saw a herd of cow elk at a great distance , and soon after took a shot at one , but failed to reach his <name> .
" i 'm going after that herd , " he said .
and as soon as the party had pitched camp , he sallied forth in one direction , while his foreman , <unk> , took another .
as <name> <name> had supposed , the elk had gone off in a bunch , and for some distance it was easy to follow them .
but further on the herd had spread out , and he had to follow with more care , for fear of getting on the wrong trail , for elk tracks ran in all directions over the mountains .
these tracks are there to-day , but the elk and the bears are fast disappearing , for ruthless hunters have done their best to exterminate the game .
after passing along for several miles , <name> <name> felt he must be drawing close to the herd .
just then his rifle happened to tap on the trunk of a tree , and instantly he heard the elk moving away in new alarm .
his hunting blood was now aroused , and he rushed forward with all speed , but as silently as possible .
by taking a short cut , the young ranchman managed to come up beside the running elk .
they were less than twenty yards away , and had it not been for the many trees which were on every side , he would have had an excellent shot at them .
as it was he brought low a fine , full-grown cow elk , and hit a bull calf in the hind leg .
later on he took up the trail of the calf and finished that also .
of this herd the foreman also brought down two , so that for the time being the hunters had all the meat they needed .
but <name> <name> was anxious to obtain some elk horns as trophies of the <name> , and day after day a watch was kept for bull elk , as the hunters moved the camp from one place to another .
at last the <unk> opportunity arrived .
three big bulls were seen , and <name> and his man went after them with all possible speed .
they were on foot , and the trail led them over some soft ground , and then through a big patch of burnt timber .
here running was by no means easy , and more than once both hunters pitched headlong into the dirt and soot , until they were covered from head to foot .
but <name> <name> was bound to get the elk , and kept on until the sweat was pouring down his face and neck .
shot after shot was fired , and all three of the animals were wounded , but still they kept on bounding away .
" one is down ! "
shouted <name> at last .
and the news proved true ; the smallest of the bulls had rocked unsteadily for a few seconds and gone to earth .
then on and on after the remaining game sped the hunters , panting and sweating as before .
" the sweat streamed down in my eyes and made furrows in the <unk> mud that covered my face , from having fallen full length down on the burnt earth , " writes the dauntless <name> , in relating this story .
" i sobbed for breath as i toiled at a <unk> trot after them , as nearly done out as could well be . "
but he did not give up ; and now the elk took a turn and went downhill , with <name> <name> pitching after them , ready to drop from exhaustion , but full of that grit to win out which has since won the admiration of all who know the man .
the second bull fell ; and now but one remained , and this dashed into a thicket .
on its heels went the daring <name> , running the chance of having the elk turn on him as soon as cornered , in which case , had <name> 's rifle been empty , the struggle for life on both sides would have been a fierce one .
in the midst of the thicket the <name> had to pause , for the elk was now out of sight , and there was no telling what new course had been taken by the game .
at a distance he saw a yellow body under the evergreen trees , and , taking hasty aim , fired .
when he came up , he was somewhat dismayed to learn that he had not brought down the elk , but a <unk> deer instead .
in the meantime , the elk got away , and it proved impossible to pick up the trail again .
there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this hunting trip , and one that all young readers should take to heart .
it shows what sticking at a thing can accomplish .
mr. <name> had determined to get at least a portion of that game , no matter what the labor and hardship involved .
many a <name> would have given up in disgust or despair after the first few shots were fired and it looked as if the elk were out of range and intended to keep out .
but this determined young man did not give up thus easily .
hard as was that run up hill and down , and regardless of the tumbles taken , and that he was so tired he could scarcely stand , he kept on until two elk were brought down , and it was firmly settled that the third could not be captured .
the way to accomplish anything in this life is to stick at it .
<name> <name> understood this truth even when he went to college , for in the harvard journal of which he was an editor he wrote , speaking of <unk> practice , " what is most necessary is that every man should realize the necessity of faithful and honest work , every afternoon . "
he put " every afternoon " in italics himself , and he meant that every <unk> player who hoped to win in the <unk> <unk> games should stick at it until he had made himself as perfect a player as possible .
a victory worth gaining is worth working for , and usually the <unk> victories are the sweetest .
chapter viii bringing down a grizzly bear  back to new york  appointed a civil service commissioner  the work of the commission it was while in the <unk> mountains that <name> <name> got his first shot at a bear .
he had been wanting such a chance for a good many years , but up to that date the bears had kept well out of his sight .
in his writings he has said much about bears , both common and grizzly , and told of their habits , and how they have been tracked down and shot at various times of the year .
he holds to the opinion that the average bear would rather run away than fight , yet he tells the story of how one bear faced the <name> who had shot him , and gave the man one blow with his powerful paw that proved fatal .
one day his companion of the hunt came riding in with the carcass of a black bear killed in a network of hollows and ravines some miles from their present camp .
" the hollows are full of bear tracks , " said <unk> .
" i am sure , if we go up there , we 'll get one or more black bears and perhaps a grizzly . "
" then let us go by all means , " responded <name> <name> .
and no time was lost in moving to the new locality .
the hunters had been out nearly all of the next day , when , on returning through the forest toward nightfall , <name> came across the <unk> of a large bear .
he tried to follow them , but night closed in on him , and he had to return to camp .
that very night the bear came around the camp , looking for something to eat .
" let us try to bring him down , " cried <name> , seizing his rifle , while his companion did the same .
but outside it was pitch dark .
" do you see him ? "
questioned <unk> .
" no . "
" neither do i . "
" listen . "
both listened , and at a distance heard the bear lumbering off slowly through the woods .
they went forward a short distance , then came to a halt .
" we 'll have to give it up for the present , " said <name> <name> .
" but i am going to have him , sooner or later , if the thing is possible . "
early the next morning both of the hunters sallied forth and discovered that the bear had been at the carcasses of some game left in the forest .
the tracks were fresh .
" he has been here , no doubt of it , " said <unk> .
" shall we wait for him to come again ? "
" we might as well , " was the answer .
" he 'll get hungry again , sooner or later . "
so the pair sat down to watch .
but the bear was shy , and kept his distance .
then it grew dark once more , so that but little could be seen under the trees .
" he knows enough to keep away , " said <name> 's companion .
" hark ! "
was the reply and both strained their ears .
there was a faint crackling of twigs , and they felt certain it was the bear .
but it was too dark to see anything ; so both shouldered their rifles and walked back to camp .
here was another illustration of <name> <name> 's method of sticking at a thing .
two days had been spent in trying to get that bear , and yet he did not give up .
on the following morning he sallied forth once more , as full of <name> as before .
the bear had been at the carcass again , and the trail was now one to be followed with ease .
" i 'm going to hunt him down to his lair , " said <name> <name> , and stalked off with his companion beside him .
soon they were again deep in the woods , walking perhaps where the foot of white man had never before trod .
fallen trees were everywhere , and over these they often had to climb .
" getting closer , " whispered <name> 's companion , and pointed to some fresh claw scratches on the bark of fallen trees .
they now moved forward as silently as indians , sure that the bear could not be far off .
suddenly <unk> dropped on his knee as if to take aim .
<name> sprang to the front , with rifle raised .
the bear was there , standing upright , only a few paces away .
without hesitation <name> <name> fired .
his aim was true , and the great beast fell with a bullet straight between the eyes .
the leaden messenger had entered his <name> , and he died with scarcely a struggle .
" the whole thing was over in twenty seconds from the time i caught sight of the game , " writes mr. <name> , in his book " hunting trips on the prairies " ( part ii of " hunting trips of a ranchman " ) .
" indeed it was over so quickly that the grizzly did not have time to show fight at all or come a step toward me .
it was the first i had ever seen , and i felt not a little proud as i stood over the great <unk> bulk which lay stretched out at length in the cool shade of the evergreens .
he was a monstrous fellow , much larger than any i have seen since , whether alive or brought in dead by hunters .
as near as we could estimate he must have weighed about twelve hundred pounds . "
there is a bear story for you , boys .
and the best of it is , it is every word true .
in later years <name> <name> brought down many more <unk> , but i doubt if he was as proud of them as he was of that first capture .
while <name> <name> was spending a large part of his time in hunting and in literary work , and in studying political economy , <name> <name> 's first term as president came to an end , and <name> <name> was inaugurated to fill the office of chief magistrate .
at that time the question of civil service was again being agitated .
<name> <name> was a warm advocate of the merit system , and knowing this , president <name> appointed him , in 1889 , a civil service commissioner , and this office he held for six years , until his resignation in 1895 .
when <name> <name> 's term of office was up , and <name> <name> was <unk> to the presidency , it was thought that <name> would have to go , but his friend , the newly elected president , wished him to remain as a commissioner , and he did so for two years longer , thus serving both under a republican and a democratic administration .
to some of my young readers the term civil service , as applied here , may be a bit perplexing .
for the benefit of such let me state that civil service here applies to the thousands of persons who work for the government , such as post-office clerks , letter carriers , clerks in the various departments at washington , like the treasury , the congressional library , the government printing office , the war department , and the hundred and one other branches in which uncle <name> needs assistance .
for seventy or eighty years these various positions had been under what is commonly called the " spoils system . "
" to the <name> belong the spoils , " had been the old motto , which generally meant that the party happening to be in power could do as it pleased about dealing out employment to those under it .
a worker might have been ever so faithful in the discharge of his duties , but if the administration was changed , he ran the risk of losing his position without any notice .
statesmen of both great political parties had long seen the injustice of the spoils system , but few cared to take the matter up for fear of offending their political friends .
but as matters grew worse , those who were honest said they would stand such a system no longer , and they began to advocate the merit plan , whereby each worker for our government should stand on his merit , so that he could not be removed from his position without just cause .
this merit system is in operation to-day and is a most excellent thing , only becoming dangerous when extended too far .
there were two other commissioners besides mr. <name> on the commission , but all worked together in <name> , although in many moves taken mr. <name> was the leader .
about this work he has written a notable essay called " six years of civil service reform , " in which he reviews much of the work done .
in this essay , among many other things , he says :  " no republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base ; and the spoils system ,  the application in political life of the degrading doctrine that to the <name> belong the spoils ,  produces corruption and degradation .
the man who is in politics for the offices might just as well be in politics for the money he can get for his vote , so far as the general good is concerned . "
certainly wise words and well worth remembering .
the work of the commission was by no means easy , and the members were often accused of doing some things merely to benefit their own particular party or friends .
politicians of the old sort , who wanted everything they could lay hands on , fought civil service bitterly , and even those who might have been expected to help often held back , fearing they would lose their own popularity .
yet on the other hand , some members of congress upheld the commission nobly , and when president <name> was assassinated by a <unk> <unk> many more came forward and <unk> to put public offices on the merit system by all means .
part of the work of the commission was to prosecute the head of any bureau or department where an employee had been discharged or had suffered without just cause .
such cases came up in large <name> and were prosecuted with all the vigor of which the commission were capable .
" we were not always successful in these trials , " says mr. <name> .
" but we won out in the majority of cases , and we gave the wrong-doing such a wide publicity that those who were guilty hesitated to repeat their actions . "
and he goes on to add that during his term of service not over one per cent .
of those who worked for uncle <name> were dismissed purely for political reasons .
this was certainly an excellent record , and our government <name> do well to maintain such a high standard in the future .
to give a further idea of the work required in the way of examinations for positions under our government , let me state that during the year from july 1 , 1890 , to july 1 , 1891 , <unk> applicants were examined for the departments service , <unk> for the customs service , <unk> for the postal service , <unk> for the railway mail service , making a total of nearly 20,000 , of which about <unk> passed and the balance failed .
since our war with spain , the work of the government has been vastly increased , and the places to be filled every year run up into figures that are startling .
one of the best and wisest acts of the commission was to place the colored employees of the government on an equal footing with the white employees .
in the past the colored employees had occupied their places merely through the whim or goodwill of those over them .
now this was changed , and any colored man who could pass the examination , and who was willing to attend strictly to his labor , was as safe in his situation as anybody .
chapter ix a trip to the <unk> mountains  caught in a driving snowstorm  back to work  resignation as civil service commissioner notwithstanding the great amount of labor involved as a civil service commissioner , <name> <name> did not forego the pleasures of the hunt , and in 1891 he made an extended trip to the <unk> mountains in <unk> , going after elk and such other game as might present itself .
on this trip he was accompanied by his ranch partner , a skilled shot named ferguson , and two old hunters named woody and <unk> .
there was also in the party a young fellow who looked after the <unk> , fourteen in number .
the start was made on a beautiful day in <name> , and the party journeyed along at a gait that pleased them , bringing down everything that came to hand and which could be used as meat .
two tents were carried , one for sheltering their packs at night and the other for sleeping purposes .
in his book called " the wilderness <name> , " mr. <name> has given many of the details of this grand hunt , which he says was one of the most exciting as well as most pleasurable undertaken .
with an interest that can not be mistaken , and which betrays the true sportsman at every turn , he gives minute descriptions of how the tents were erected , how everything in camp was put in its proper place , and how on wet days they would huddle around the camp-fire in the middle of the larger tent to keep warm and dry .
he also tells how the packs on the horses were adjusted , and adds that the <name> who can not take care of his outfit while on the hunt , or who must have all his game stalked for him , is a <name> in name only ;  which is literally true , as every genuine sportsman knows .
the young civil service commissioner went out <unk> in a fitting hunting costume , consisting of a buckskin shirt , with stout leggings , and moccasins , or , when occasion required , <unk> boots .
heavy overcoats were also carried and plenty of blankets , and for extra cold nights <name> <name> had a fur <unk> , in which , no doubt , he slept " as snug as a bug in a rug . "
the horses of a pack-train in the wild west are not always thoroughly broken , and although the majority rarely do anything worse than <unk> behind or stray away , yet occasionally one or another <name> indulge in antics far from desired .
this was true on the present occasion , when at different times the <unk> went on a " <unk> " that upset all calculations and scattered packs far and wide , causing a general alarm and hard work on the part of all hands to restore quietness and order .
for two days the hunters pushed on into the mountains with but little signs of game .
then a <unk> set in which made the outlook a dismal one .
" going to have a big storm , " said one of the old hunters .
" never mind , we 'll have to take it as it comes , " was mr. <unk> philosophical answer .
" we ca n't expect good weather every day . "
it was almost noon of that day when all heard the call of a bull elk , echoing over the hills .
the sound came from no great distance , and in the face of the rain , <name> <name> and the <name> named woody set off on foot after the beast , who was still calling as loudly as ever .
it was not long before the hunters could hear the bull plainly , as he pawed the earth , a challenge to another bull who was answering him from a great distance .
" we are gettin ' closer to him , " said woody .
" got to go slow now , or he 'll take alarm and be off like a flash . "
the timber was rather thin , and the ground was covered with moss and fallen leaves , and over this the pair glided as silently as shadows , until woody declared that the bull was not over a hundred yards away .
" and he 's in a tearing rage , on account of that other bull , " he added .
" got to plug him fair and square or there <name> be trouble . "
without replying to this , <name> <name> took the lead , keeping eyes and ears wide open for anything that might come to hand .
then through the trees he caught sight of the stately horns of the elk , as he stood with head thrown back , repeating his call in <unk> tones .
as the hunters came closer , the elk faced around and caught sight of his human enemies .
up went his antlers once more , as if to defy them .
" he 's coming ! "
shouted woody .
and scarcely had he spoken when <name> <name> took aim and fired at the animal .
there was a snort and a gasp , and the elk turned to run away .
then <name> fired a second shot , and over went the monarch of the forest in his death agony .
it was a fine bit of game to bring down , the antlers having twelve prongs .
the head was cut off and taken back to camp , along with a small part of the best of the meat .
after that the forward march was resumed in the face of a sweeping rain that wet everybody to the skin .
on they went until , just as the rain ceased , they reached a bold plateau , overlooking what is called <unk> pass , a wild and wonderful freak of nature , surrounded by lofty mountains and watered by streams and <name> flowing in several directions .
far up the mountains could be seen the <unk> , while lower down were the heavy forests and underbrush , the haunts of the game they were seeking .
in this wonderland <name> <name> hunted to his heart 's content for many days  bringing down several more elk and also a fair variety of smaller game .
it was now growing colder , and knowing that the <name> season was close at hand , the hunters decided to strike camp and return homeward .
the movement was made none too soon .
the snow was already filling the air , and one morning , on coming from his tent , <name> <name> found the ground covered to a depth of a foot and a half .
to add to his discomfort the pony he was riding began to <name> that day and managed to <unk> his rider 's thumb .
but <name> <name> stuck to him and showed him who was master ; and after that matters went better .
the snow continued to come down , and before the end of the journey was reached , at great geyser basin , the hunters almost perished from the cold .
such pictures as the above give us some idea of the varied life that <name> <name> has led .
even at this early age  he was but thirty-three years old  he had been a college student , a traveller , an author , an assemblyman , a ranchman and <name> , and a civil service commissioner .
he had travelled the length and breadth of europe and through a large section of our own country .
he had visited the palaces of kings and the <unk> of the humble cowboys of the far west , he had met men in high places and in low , and had seen them at their best and at their worst .
surely if " experience is the school wherein man learns wisdom , " then the future president had ample means of growing wise , and his works prove that those means were not neglected .
as already mentioned , when <name> <name> became president a second time , he requested <name> <name> to retain his place on the civil service commission .
this was a practical illustration of the workings of the merit system , and it made for mr. <name> many friends among his former political enemies .
by this movement the workings of the commission were greatly strengthened , so that by the time <name> <name> resigned , on may 5 , 1895 , the commission had added twenty thousand places filled by government employees to those coming under the merit system .
this number was larger than any placed under the system before that time , and the record has scarcely been equalled since .
" he was a fighter for the system , day and night , " says one who knew him at that time .
" he was enthusiastic to the last degree , and had all sorts of statistics at his fingers ' ends .
if anybody in the government employ was doing wrong , he was willing to pitch into that person regardless of consequences .
some few politicians thought he was a crank on the subject , but the results speak for themselves .
some politicians , who wanted the old spoils system retained , were often after him like a swarm of angry hornets , but he never got out of their way , and when they tried to sting , he slapped them in a way that soon made them leave him alone .
and more than that , he was very clever in the way that he presented his case to those representatives and senators who understood the real value of civil service reform .
he made them appreciate what he and his <unk> were trying to do , and when the commission was attacked in congress it always had , as a consequence , a support that could not be easily overthrown . "
when <name> <name> resigned , president <name> wrote as follows to him :  " you are certainly to be congratulated upon the extent and permanency of civil service reform methods which you have so substantially aided in bringing about .
the struggle for its firm establishment and recognition is past .
its faithful application and reasonable expansion remain , subjects of deep interest to all who really <name> the best attainable public service . "
it was high praise for the retiring commissioner , and it was well deserved .
chapter x appointed police commissioner of new york city  <unk> of the department  strenuous efforts to make matters better  a " dry " <name>  enforcing the tenement house law and other measures during the time that <name> <name> was a civil service commissioner there were several important political changes made in new york city .
in the past there had been a great deal of what is familiarly called " machine politics , " and matters had been going from bad to worse .
but now there was an upward turn by the election of <name> s. strong to the office of mayor .
mr. strong was a man of high character , and was elected by a vote that combined the best elements of all the political parties .
it was at a time when new york city was in urgent need of reform .
those in power were doing but little to stop the corruption that was stalking abroad upon every hand .
bribes were given and taken in nearly all departments , clerks were being paid large salaries for doing practically nothing , and contracts were put out , not to those who could do the best work , but to those who would pay the political <unk> the most money for them .
the record of the police department was perhaps the blackest of the lot .
it was to this department that the citizens looked for protection from crime , yet it was known that many in the department winked at all sorts of vice , providing they were properly paid for so doing .
saloons and worse resorts were kept open in defiance of the law , and wickedness <unk> itself in the face of the public in a manner that was truly shocking .
occasionally a private citizen would try to do something to mend matters , but his complaint was generally " <unk> , " and that would be the end of the matter .
the <unk> , as it was well called , extended from the highest places in the department to the lowest , so that it was said not even a policeman could secure his appointment without paying several hundred dollars for it , and this he was , of course , expected to get back by <unk> those who lived or did business on his beat .
and get it back the policeman would , even if he had to make an italian fruit dealer pay him a dollar a month for having a stand on the sidewalk , where the walk was supposed to be free from obstruction .
when <name> strong came into office , the first thing he did was to cast his eyes about him for reliable men who might aid him in purifying the city .
he already knew of <name> <name> 's work as an assemblyman and a civil service commissioner .
" mr. <name> is just the man to take the office of police commissioner and put the department on an honorable basis , " said the newly elected mayor , and he lost no time in <unk> the office to mr. <name> .
the tender was accepted , and <name> <name> was sworn into his new position on may 24 , 1895 .
the appointment of mr. <name> to the office of police commissioner was a great shock to nearly the entire police department .
he was known for his <name> honesty , and it was felt that he would not <unk> crime in any shape or form .
" there <name> be a grand shaking up , " said more than one .
" just you wait till he gets to the bottom of things .
he 'll turn the light on in a way that <name> make more than one officer tremble in his boots . "
on the board with mr. <name> were <name> d. <name> , <name> d. andrews , and <name> d. <name> , the latter the son of former president <name> .
<name> <name> was chosen president , and the board lost no time in getting to work .
" the new board found the department in a demoralized condition , " says mr. <name> , in his report on the matter .
" a recent grand jury had investigated the records of many officers , and many <unk> had been found ; 268 vacancies existed in the department , and 26 officers , including one inspector and five captains , were under suspension on account of indictment for crime . "
this was truly a sad state of affairs , and a horrible example to the other large cities of our union .
the commissioners went to work with a <name> , and <name> <name> was the leading spirit in every move made .
every branch of the police department was given an <unk> , and those who would not do their duty were promptly dismissed , while minor offences were met with heavy fines .
by an act of the legislature the force of men was increased to eight hundred , to keep pace with the growth of the metropolis .
the men who were particularly faithful in the discharge of their duties were rewarded by honorable mention , engrossed certificates , medals of honor , and by <unk> .
more than this , they were given to understand that if they did their duty faithfully they need not fear trouble from those over them , no matter what changes were made .
no officer was allowed to accept blackmail money from those lower in the service ; and above all , no politics were to interfere with the fair and square running of the whole department .
it was a gigantic task , and it can not be said that it was totally successful , for the opposition in some quarters was strong .
more than once mr. <name> was threatened with violence , but , as when an assemblyman , he paid but scant attention to these mutterings .
his habits of personally investigating matters still clung to him , and it is well remembered how he went around at odd hours of the day and night , and on sundays , seeing if the policemen were really doing their duty .
there had been a boast that all policemen were at their posts at night .
mr. <name> went out once and found just two out of an even dozen where they should be .
then began that " shaking up " that has resulted in better police service in new york to this day .
the effect of the new vigor in the police department was felt in many other ways .
there was a <unk> law regarding buildings which were unfit for human habitations .
new york city was crowded with such buildings , but nobody had ordered them torn down , because either nobody wanted to bother , or the owners paid blackmail money to keep them standing for the rent they could get out of them .
" those tenements must come down , " said <name> <name> .
" if you order them down , the owners <name> fight you to the bitter end , " said another officer of the department .
" i do n't care if they do .
the houses are a menace to life and health .
they are filthy , and if a fire ever started in them , some would prove regular traps .
they have got to go . "
and shortly after that about a hundred were seized , and the most destroyed .
the <unk> of the <name> liquor law was another thing that occasioned great surprise during mr. <name> 's term as police commissioner .
in the past , saloons had been almost as wide open on sundays as on week days .
on account of the cosmopolitan character of the population it was thought that to close up the saloons on sundays would be impossible .
but the police force was given strict orders , and on one <name> in <name> , 1895 , new york city had the first " dry " <name> that it could remember in many years .
this " dry " <name> provoked a new storm of opposition , especially from many of foreign birth , who were used to getting liquor as easily on that day as on any other .
more threats were made against the vigorous commissioner , and on two occasions dynamite bombs were placed in his desk , evidently with the <name> that they would explode and blow him to pieces .
but the bombs were found in time , and no damage was done , and <name> <name> paid scant attention to them .
after that he was attacked in a new way .
some of the politicians laid traps for him whereby they hoped to bring discredit to his management of the department .
the fight grew very hot and very bitter , and he was accused of doing many things , " just for the looks of them , " rather than to benefit the public at large .
but he kept on his way , and at last the opposition were silenced to such an extent that they merely growled behind his back .
for many years a large number of shiftless and often lawless men , and women too , were attracted to the metropolis because of the " <unk> lodging houses " located there .
these resorts were continually filled by <unk> who would not work and who were a constant menace to society at large .
" we must get rid of those lodging houses , " said mr. <name> .
" they simply breed crime .
no respectable man or woman , no matter how poor , <name> enter them . "
" but we 'll have to have some sort of shelter for the poor people , " said others .
" to be sure  for those who are deserving .
the others should be driven off and discouraged , " answered mr. <name> .
and one by one the <unk> lodging places were abolished .
in their place the board of charities opened a municipal lodging house , where those who were deserving were received , were made to bathe , and given proper shelter and nourishment .
a story is told that , during the excitement attending the closing of saloons on <name> , a friend came to mr. <name> and told about hearing some <unk> plotting to harm him .
" what can they do ? "
demanded the police commissioner .
" i am afraid they can do a good deal , " was the answer .
" each of those men has a barkeeper who has been in jail for various crimes .
they may attack you some dark night and kill you . "
" perhaps i wo n't give them the chance , " answered the man who had been on many a dangerous hunt in the wild west .
" if they can shoot , so can i . "
" but they may sneak up behind you and knock you out , " insisted the visitor .
" well , if they do that , i shall have died doing my duty , " was the calm answer made by the future hero of the rough riders .
chapter xi appointed first assistant secretary of the navy  the condition of affairs in cuba  preparing for war  <name> <name> 's resolve while <name> <name> was serving as police commissioner of the city of new york , <name> <name> ran for the presidency of the united states the first time and was elected .
the young commissioner was a firm <unk> of <name> , for he did not believe in " free silver " as it was called , but in " sound money , " which meant that in the future , as in the past , all national indebtedness should be made payable in gold , instead of in gold and silver , as many desired .
as soon as the new president was inaugurated , march 4 , 1897 , he appointed hon .
<name> d. long to be secretary of the navy .
mr. long knew <name> <name> well , and also knew of the " history of the naval war of 1812 , " which the energetic author and commissioner had written .
" he is just the man we need here , " said mr. long to president <name> .
" he has made a study of the navy , and he is not afraid of work , " and without further delay <name> <name> was asked to resign his position in the metropolis and come to washington , where he was duly installed as first assistant secretary of the navy .
in his new position , certainly a high one for such a young man to occupy , mr. <name> had much to do .
as first assistant , nearly the whole responsibility of the real workings of the department fell upon his shoulders .
he took up these responsibilities manfully , and how well he succeeded in the work , history has abundantly proved .
" it was <name> 's work that made <name> 's victory at manila possible , " one who knew of the inner workings of the department has said , and another has said that the victory off <name> bay was also due in part to <name> 's watchfulness over the ships that took part in that conflict .
at washington the assistant secretary found an <name> of extravagance equal to that which he had discovered in new york .
the navy department was paying dearly for almost everything it bought , and many laborers and others were drawing high wages for doing little or no work .
against this <name> <name> set his face <unk> , so that inside of a year the actual saving to our government was twenty-five per cent .
when it is remembered that the navy department spends each year millions of dollars , something of what such a saving means can be realized .
for many years our country had been at peace with the whole world , but now a war cloud showed itself on the horizon , scarcely visible at first , but gradually growing larger and larger .
those at washington watched it with great anxiety , wondering if it would burst , and what would be the result .
cuba had been fighting for <name> for years .
it was under spanish rule , and the people were frightfully oppressed .
to spain they paid vast sums of money and got but little in return .
money that should have gone into improvements  that should have supplied good roads and schools  went into the pockets of the royalty of spain .
when a cuban tried to remonstrate , he could scarcely get a hearing , and this state of affairs went from bad to worse until , in sheer desperation , the cubans declared war on the <unk> , just as in <unk> our own nation threw off the yoke of england .
as my young readers know , cuba lies only a short distance from the southeast coast of <name> .
being so close , it was but natural that our people should take an interest in the struggle at hand .
everybody sympathized with the cubans , and some made offers of assistance .
then , when many cubans were on the verge of starvation , we voted to send them relief in the way of something to eat .
the action of the united states was viewed with suspicion by spain .
the people of that country were certain we wanted to help cuba only in order to " <unk> her up afterward , " as the saying went .
such was not our intention at all , and total cuban <name> to-day <unk> to that fact .
not knowing how far matters might go , president <name> and his advisers deemed it wise to prepare for the worst .
this meant to put the army and navy on the best possible footing in the least possible time .
it was felt that should war come , it would be fought largely on the sea , and nobody realized this more than did <name> <name> .
he was active day and night in the pursuit of his duty , seeing to it that this ship or that was properly manned , and this fortification and that put in proper order to resist attack .
our ships were in all parts of the world , on the atlantic and the pacific , in the far north and the far south , in european waters and <name> <unk> harbor .
each had to be supplied with coal and ammunition and with provisions .
those that were " out of commission , " that is , laid up , generally for repairs , were put into commission with all speed .
a thousand contracts had to be inspected , judged , and passed upon .
outwardly the navy department at washington was moving along as peacefully as ever , internally it was more active than it had been at any time since the great civil war .
" war may come at any moment , " said mr. <name> to his friends .
" and if it does come , there is nothing like being prepared for it . "
about one thing <name> <name> was very particular .
in the past , gun practice on board of our war-ships had been largely a matter of simply going through the motions of handling the guns .
" this <name> not do , " said the assistant secretary .
" our gunners <name> never make good <unk> in that way .
they must practise with powder and ball , shot and shell . "
and after that they did .
such practice cost a round sum of money , and the department was criticised for its <unk> in this direction ; but the worth of it was afterward proven when commodore <name> sank the spanish ships in manila bay , and the atlantic squadron likewise destroyed the enemy 's ships that were trying to escape from <name> harbor .
in those days at washington , <name> <name> made a warm , personal friend of dr. <name> wood .
dr. wood was an army surgeon , who had seen considerable active service while under general miles in the campaigns against the <unk> indians .
mr. <name> has himself told how he and dr. wood would often , after office hours , take long walks out of the city , or play <unk> , or go <unk> when the weather permitted , and during such <unk> their conversation was invariably about the situation in cuba , and what each intended to do should war break out .
" if war actually comes , i intend , by hook or by crook , to get out into the field , " said dr. wood .
" i shall go with you , " answered <name> <name> .
" no more office work for me if there is any fighting to be done . "
in the meantime , as already mentioned , matters in cuba were rapidly approaching a crisis .
spain could not send a large enough army to the island to conquer the people while they were at <name> to roam through the jungles and mountains , and so began to drive men , women , and children into various cities or camps , where they were kept , under penalty of death if they tried to escape .
thus large <name> were torn from their homes , and sent miles and miles away , with no money , and nothing with which to support themselves .
food became scarce and high in price , and many grown folks and children were literally starved to death .
to help these starving people the congress of our country voted to expend fifty thousand dollars from the national treasury .
this excited spain more than ever , and we were accused of trying to prolong the rebellion .
but the deed was done , and many would have had us go farther , and recognize cuba as a free and independent nation .
this <name> was overruled on the ground that our government could not with propriety endanger the peace of the world by taking so serious a step at that time .
but the strength of popular sympathy with an oppressed people was shown by the fact that many americans at grave personal risk went to cuba , and joined the army in one capacity or another , fighting as bravely as if for their own individual rights .
chapter xii destruction of the maine  <name> 's victory  <name> <name> becomes a soldier  organizing the rough riders  various men in the command " the maine has been blown up ! "
such was the awful news which startled this whole nation in the middle of february , 1898 , and which caused the question of war with spain to <unk> without further deliberation .
the maine was a battleship of large size , that had been sent down to the harbor of havana , cuba , on nothing more than a friendly visit .
the explosion that destroyed this <name> vessel occurred about ten o'clock at night , and was heard for miles around .
soon after the explosion , the war-ship began to sink , and over two hundred and fifty sailors and officers lost their lives .
the entire nation was now aroused , and many wanted to go to war with spain immediately .
but the spaniards professed to be ignorant of the cause of the explosion , and said it must have come from the inside of the ship and not the outside .
without delay a board of inquiry was established , and it was settled that the explosion had come from the outside , probably from a mine set by the spaniards in havana harbor .
" this means war , and nothing but war , " said even the wisest of our statesmen .
and so it proved .
without hesitation the whole nation sprang forward to uphold the administration , and in a few days congress passed an appropriation of fifty millions of dollars " for national defence . "
it may be added that this appropriation was passed unanimously , regardless of party politics and regardless of the differences which , in the past , had existed between the north and the south .
we have already learned what had been done to prepare the navy for the conflicts to follow .
now there was even more work on hand , to get the army into shape for service in cuba and on other foreign soil .
the regular army at that time consisted of about twenty-five thousand men , scattered all over the united states ,  on the frontier , at the indian reservations , and along the <unk> .
many of these troops were hurried to camps in the southeast portion of our country , leaving but small garrisons in the far west .
it was realized by president <name> that our regular army could not cope with the troubles at hand , and soon came a call for one hundred and twenty-five thousand volunteers .
these volunteers were to come from the various states and territories , each furnishing its proportion of soldiers according to its population .
these soldiers were quickly collected and marched to the various state camps , there to be sworn into the service of the united states .
the " war fever " was everywhere , and many private parties began to raise companies , while all sorts of independent commands , grand army , confederate veterans , <unk> guards , <name> singing societies , colored guards , and the like , offered their assistance .
even the colleges caught the fever , and men went forth from yale , harvard , princeton , and other institutions of learning to battle for uncle <name> .
the first blow struck at spain was a most effective one .
commodore , afterwards admiral , <name> was at <name> <unk> when the trouble began , and he was directed by the war department to hunt for a spanish fleet somewhere among the philippine islands and engage it .
on <name> , may 1 , came the news that the gallant commodore had reached manila bay , fought the spanish fleet and sunk every hostile ship , and come out of the battle with all of his own ships safe and not a single man killed !
" hurrah !
that shows what our navy can do ! "
cried many citizens .
and they were justly proud .
in the past , foreign nations had looked with something akin to scorn on our vessels and the way they were manned .
now such criticism was silenced ; and this result was , in a certain measure , due to the work of <name> <name> , while first assistant secretary to secretary long .
but <name> <name> was no longer in the department .
he resigned and closed his desk , saying , " my duty here is done ; my place is in the field . "
with such an active nature , it was impossible for him to remain a private citizen while stern war was a reality .
in his own excellent work , " the rough riders , " and in his sworn testimony before the commission of investigation of the spanish war , mr. <name> has given us graphic pictures of how the first united states volunteer cavalry , commonly called the rough riders , happened to be organized , and what it tried to do and did , and this testimony is supplemented by many who know the facts , and who took part in the battles which made the organization famous throughout the length and breadth of our land .
at first <name> <name> thought to attach himself to the militia of new york , but found every place taken .
" let us try one of my massachusetts regiments , " said dr. wood .
and this was also done , with a like result .
" we could fill every place , did we want five times as many men , " said one colonel .
" everybody seems crazy to go . "
this shows how truly patriotic our nation can become when the occasion arises for going to the front .
while <name> <name> and his intimate friend were wondering what to do next , congress authorized the raising of three cavalry regiments , to be composed of the daring <unk> and riders of new mexico , oklahoma , arizona , and indian territory .
" there , that <name> just suit me , " said <name> <name> .
" i know many of those men , and i know we can raise a regiment in no time . "
and without delay he sought out secretary of war <unk> and told him of his hopes .
" i am perfectly willing to give you command of one of those regiments , " said the war secretary .
" i know you are something of a rough rider yourself , and a good marksman to boot . "
this was certainly flattering , but <name> <name> 's head was not turned by the offer .
" i do n't think i am quite ready to take command , " said he .
" i know that i can learn , and that quickly , but it <name> be precious time wasted . "
" well , what do you wish , mr .
<name> ? "
asked the secretary of war , curiously .
" what i should like best of all is for dr. wood to become colonel of the regiment , and for myself to become lieutenant-colonel . "
" very well ; i <name> consult president <name> on the subject , " said the secretary .
the request was granted , and in a few days more colonel wood and lieutenant-colonel <name> sallied forth to organize the rough riders , and fit them for service in cuba .
leaving his family , which now consisted of his wife and six children , the lieutenant-colonel made his way to san <name> , texas , where the regiment was to gather .
previous to going he spent a full week in washington , seeing to it that arrangements were completed for supplying the command with uniforms , carbines , saddles , and other articles which were needed .
this was in itself quite a task , for all of the departments at the capitol were more than busy , and it took a great amount of " <unk> " to get what one wanted .
as soon as it was known that <name> <name> was going to help organize the rough riders , offers from everywhere began to pour in upon him .
not alone did the men of the plains and ranch who knew him want to go , but likewise his old college chums at harvard .
these men , of wealth and good families , were willing to serve in any capacity , if only they could be mustered in .
there were crack <unk> and <unk> players , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and men of fortune , all mixed in with hunters , cowboys , men who had served as sheriffs in the far west , where fighting was an everyday occurrence , some policemen who had served under <name> when he was a police commissioner in new york , and even some indians .
nearly every nationality was represented when it came to blood , and the men ran from the best educated to the most ignorant .
[ illustration : <name> <name> as a rough rider ( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] but there were three tests which every man , private or officer , had to pass .
he had to be in perfect health , he had to know how to ride , and he had to know how to shoot .
to these conditions were afterward added two more : each man had to learn his duty as quickly as he could and had to learn to obey his superiors .
in such a collection of soldiers it was but natural that the real leaders soon asserted themselves .
several of the captains had served in the united states army before ; two were former famous western sheriffs ; and all were full of that pluck and energy which is bound to command success .
in this regiment were some men who had hunted with <name> <name> on more than one occasion .
they knew him well and loved him , and did their best to serve him .
to them he was really their commander , although they officially recognized colonel wood .
they were <unk> " <unk> rough riders , " and the great majority of the people of our nation call them such to this day .
the majority of the command were rather young in years , although a few were of middle age .
but all were tough and hardy , either from athletic training or from years spent in the open air of the great west .
some of them could ride almost any kind of a horse , and " bronco <unk> , " that is , breaking in a wild steed , was common sport among them .
some had spent nearly their entire lives in the saddle , and some could exhibit remarkable skill with their firearms while riding at full speed .
when the men began to come into san <name> , they found but little in the way of accommodations .
but soon tents and blankets were procured .
it is said that good shoes were scarce , but some of the soldiers did not mind going without them .
the regiment was supplied with good rifles , but the cartridges were not made of <unk> powder , which was a bad thing , for smoke sometimes enables an enemy to locate the shooter , when , if <unk> powder were used , nothing could be seen .
each man had also a six shooter , and was to have had a <unk> , but the long knives did not come .
" on to cuba ! "
was the cry .
and it was taken up every day .
the rough riders were eager for the fray .
alas !
little did many of them realize that , once in the " bloody isle , " they would never see their native land again .
chapter xiii in camp at tampa  to port tampa in coal cars  <name> <name> 's quick move to obtain a transport  the wait in the harbor  off for cuba at last that the path of the soldier is not always one full of <name> can easily be proven by what happened to the rough riders when , late in may , they were ordered to tampa , <name> , where a part of the army was gathering in readiness to be transported to cuba .
" we were just wild to go , " says one of the number , in speaking of that time .
" we were tired of staying at san <name> and drilling day in and day out , rain or shine .
i guess everybody felt like <unk> when we piled on to the cars .
" colonel <name>  he was only lieutenant-colonel then  had six troops under him , and he did all he could to make the boys comfortable .
but the cars were crowded , and travelling was so slow it took us four days to reach tampa .
then when we got there , we found everything in confusion .
the railroad yard was <unk> with freight and passenger cars , and nobody was there to tell us where to go or where to find provisions .
" the boys were hungry and tired out , for sleeping on the railroad had been almost out of the question .
there was n't a sign of rations in sight , and it looked as if we would have to stay hungry .
but <name> <name> just put his hand into his own pocket and bought us about all we wanted .
then he <unk> around and found out where we were to go , and in another twenty-four hours we were settled in camp . "
even in camp the rough riders had to put up with continued discomfort .
the weather was warm , flies and mosquitoes were numerous , and the drinking water was not of the best .
the rations were plain , but the rough riders did not mind this , for many of them had often fared worse on the plains .
although it was now a regular military camp that the rough riders were in , it was rather difficult to control some of the men , especially those who had been used to an unusually rough life .
but they were held in check as much as possible by their commanders , and on <name> all attended a church service held by chaplain brown , who spoke to them in a manner that soon claimed their attention .
after but a few days spent in the camp at tampa , within walking distance of many of the fashionable hotels , the command was ordered to port tampa , there to board a transport to sail for some destination not revealed .
but the soldiers knew they were going to cuba , to fight the spaniards and to aid in <unk> cuba , and again there was a loud <unk> .
but immediately on top of this came one of the hardest blows the rough riders had to endure , and one which some of them <name> probably never forget .
as already stated , volunteers from all over our nation were anxious to get into the fight , and it was no easy matter for the authorities at washington to decide who should go and who should be left behind .
" only eight troops of seventy men each of the rough riders <name> embark on the transport , " was the order sent to colonel wood .
more than this , it was ordered that the command should be on board of the transport by the following morning , otherwise it could not go .
" four troops to be left behind ! "
exclaimed <name> <name> .
" too bad , " returned colonel wood .
" every man expects to go , and wants to go . "
it was a hard task to tell some of the men that they could not go .
mr. <name> tells us that many of them actually cried at the news .
they were willing to go under any conditions .
they did not want any pay , they did not want any <unk> if they were disabled , and some , who had money , even offered to pay their way , just for the privilege of fighting for uncle <name> .
after such an exhibition , let nobody dare to say that true patriotism is dying out in this country .
but orders were orders , and as quickly as possible those to go were selected .
then the command marched to the railroad tracks to await the cars .
none came , and they were given orders to march to another track .
this they also did ; but still no train appeared .
" we 'll be left , that is certain , " said colonel wood , anxiously .
" it certainly looks like it , unless we march the boys down to the port . "
" here comes a train ! "
was the cry .
it was a train , but only of empty coal cars .
it was about to pass by when the rough riders halted it .
" what 's the matter with riding down to the port in the coal cars ? "
was the question asked by several .
" good enough ! "
came the answer .
" into the cars , boys , and do n't waste time ! "
and into the dirty coal cars they piled , and persuaded the engineer of the train to take them down to port tampa as quickly as he could .
if there had been bustle and confusion up at tampa , it was far worse at the port .
everybody was in a hurry , and ten thousand soldiers stood around , not knowing what to do with their baggage , and not knowing which of the many transports to board .
at last the rough riders were told to go aboard the <unk> , and started to do so .
" the <unk> ? "
exclaimed a member of another command .
" that is our transport . "
" no , she has been allotted to us , " put in an officer belonging to still another command .
" how many men <name> she hold ? "
questioned a captain of the rough riders .
" about a thousand . "
" then she ca n't take the three commands . "
<name> <name> overheard this talk , and at once made up his mind that it would be a question of what command got aboard of the transport first .
without the loss of a moment he ran back to where his men were in waiting .
" double-quick to the dock ! "
was his order .
and forming quickly , the troops made their way to the wharf with all possible speed .
in the meantime , colonel wood had gone out to the transport in a <unk> and gotten the vessel to come up to the wharf .
on board went the rough riders pell-mell , and not a minute too soon .
" this is our boat ! "
cried an officer , as he came up with his command a minute later .
" sorry for you , sir , but it is our boat , " was colonel wood 's firm answer .
then the third command loomed up , and a <unk> dispute arose .
but the rough riders remained aboard of the transport , taking four companies of another command in with them .
i have told of the particulars of this affair to show my young readers what was needed at this time , and how well <name> <name> performed his duties .
he had been a soldier and officer only a few weeks , yet he realized that army life on paper and army life in reality were two different things .
he felt that an officer must do much besides leading his men in the field : that he must look after them constantly , see that their health was provided for , see that they got their rations , see that transportation was ready when needed , and even see to it that some were kept away from the temptations of drink , and that they did not quarrel among themselves .
when going on board of the transport , the rough riders were supplied with twelve days ' rations each .
the most of the food was good , but the canned beef was very bad , just as it was found to be very bad in many other quarters , and it made a great number sick .
added to this , somebody had forgotten to issue salt to the soldiers ; so much had to be eaten without this very necessary <unk> .
" but we took matters good-naturedly , " said one of the number , in speaking of the trip that followed .
" many of the boys were out for a lark , and when they growled , they did it good-naturedly .
we had all sorts of men , and all sorts of nicknames .
an irishman was called <name> <name> , and a nice young jew old pork chop .
one fellow who was particularly slow was called speedy <name> , and another who always spoke in a quick , <unk> voice answered to the hail of <unk> <name> . '
one cowboy who was as rough as anybody in the command was christened the parson , and a fine , high-toned , well-educated college boy had to answer to the name of <name> the tramp .
some of the boys could sing , and they organized the rough rider <unk> ; and others could play , and they gave us music on the mouth <unk> and other instruments they had managed to smuggle along . "
the war department had expected to send the troops to cuba without delay , but now came in a report that some spanish war-ships were hovering around , ready to sink the transports as soon as they should show themselves , and for five days the vessels remained in port tampa harbor , until it was ascertained that the report was untrue .
those five days were important to <name> <name> and to the men under him .
every day the young officer spent a certain portion of his time in studying military tactics and in drilling his soldiers .
much had still to be learned , and the officers had their school of instructions as well as did those under them .
the weather was broiling hot , and some were already suffering from fever or its symptoms .
fortunately bathing was good , and many went in once or twice a day .
bathing in the ocean was great sport to some of the <unk> who had never seen anything larger than a river or creek , and they <unk> around like children , and got up races , with prizes for the best swimmers .
at last came the orders for the transports to set sail for cuba .
they numbered thirty-two in all , including a schooner which was towed along filled with drinking water , for water must be had , and that was the only place where it could be stowed .
to protect the transports from a possible attack by the enemy , they were accompanied by five war-ships at first , and later on by fourteen .
all told , there were on the transports eight hundred officers and sixteen thousand enlisted men .
of the commands , the most were from the regular army , the volunteers numbering but three  the rough riders , the <unk> new york infantry , and the second massachusetts infantry .
chapter xiv life on the transport  the landing at <unk>  the march to <unk>  the trail through the jungle  the skirmish at la <unk> while the army was preparing to invade cuba , matters so far as they concerned the navy had been moving along rapidly .
commodore <name> had sunk the spanish fleet in manila bay ; havana and the adjacent coasts were being <unk> , so no ships could pass in or out without running the risk of capture ; and a large fleet of war-ships under admiral cervera , of the enemy 's navy , had been " bottled up " in <name> harbor .
it had been decided that the united states troops should be landed on the southeast coast of cuba , not far from the entrance to <name> bay , and from that point should make an advance on <name> , which is the second city of importance in the island .
day after day the flotilla of transports kept on its way , spread out in a broad column during the time it was light , and coming in close together during the night .
the war-ships hovered near , and at night swept the ocean with their powerful <unk> , rendering a surprise by the enemy impossible .
the trip to the southeast coast of cuba lasted seven days .
it was very hot , even for this time of the year , and those who could , slept on deck during the voyage .
there was but little to do , and when not drilling , the men took it easy in the shade ,  sleeping , chatting , or playing games .
sometimes they would talk of the future and wonder how much of real fighting lay before them .
" we did n't know even then where we were going , " said one , in speaking of the trip .
" i do n't believe wood or <name> knew either .
first we thought it might be havana , then we imagined it might be porto <name> , but when we turned southward and ran around the eastern end of the island , we all knew we were bound for <name> . "
as the transports swept up toward the mouth of <name> bay , they came within sight of the american war-ships that were keeping admiral cervera 's fleet " bottled up " in the harbor .
a shout of recognition went up , and one of the bands struck up a patriotic air that was truly inspiring .
the landing of the rough riders and many other commands was made at <unk> , a small settlement on the coast east of <name> harbor .
the <unk> got closer to the shore than most of the other transports , and the men lost no time in <unk> , taking with them two <unk> automatic guns and a dynamite gun of which they had become possessed .
as there had not been transports enough , only the officers ' horses had been brought along .
these were thrown into the water and made to swim ashore .
<name> <name> had two horses , but one was drowned .
it was important that the landing should be guarded , and the war-ships sent in some shot and shell to dislodge any spaniards who might be in the vicinity .
but none showed themselves , and soon nearly all of the soldiers were ashore , either at <unk> or at a landing a short distance farther westward .
no enemy was in sight , and the only persons who appeared were some cubans , soldiers and civilians , who wanted but one thing , food .
the rough riders had been put into a brigade commanded by general <unk> .
young .
there were two of these brigades , and it is worth noting that they formed a division under the command of <unk> <name> wheeler , who had in years gone by fought so gallantly on the side of the confederacy .
now , as brave as of old , he was fighting for old <name> , the one banner of the north and the south alike .
as the rough riders landed , they were marched up the beach , and here they went into temporary camp ,  an easy matter , since each soldier carried his outfit with him , or , at least , as much as he could get of what belonged to him .
<name> <name> had his weapons and ammunition , a mackintosh and a <unk> , certainly much less than he had carried even when roughing it in the bad lands of the west .
as soon as the larger portion of the army was landed , general lawton  he who was afterward to give his life for his flag in the philippines  threw out a strong detachment on the <name> road to the westward , and also detachments on the roads to the north and east .
" on to <name> ! "
was the cry .
and many were for pushing forward without delay .
but the transports had still to unload their baggage , and word did not reach the rough riders to move on until the afternoon of the day after landing .
it was a <name> , uneven country , with much brushwood and jungles of trees and vines .
it had rained , but now the sun came out fiercely , and the rough riders ( riders in name only , for only the officers were on horseback ) suffered greatly through being clad in <name> uniform .
" it was a tough and tiresome march , " said one who was there .
" the air just quivered with heat , and many of the boys felt like throwing half of their clothing away .
whenever we reached a drinking place , the crowd would swarm around for water like a lot of bees .
" general lawton had his outposts pretty well advanced .
our commander , old general wheeler , was just as anxious to make a showing , and he ordered general young to push on with the rough riders and some other troops .
so away we went , with colonel wood at our head , and lieutenant-colonel <name> in command of one squadron and <name> <unk> in command of the other .
in some spots the road was frightful , full of <unk> , with big land crabs crawling around in all directions , and with the trailing vines full of poisonous spiders .
we did n't know but that the woods might be full of spaniards , and we were on the alert to give the dons as good as they sent , should they show themselves . "
by nightfall the rough riders reached the little village of <unk> without having met the enemy .
here they went into camp in the midst of a heavy thunder-storm in which every soldier and officer was drenched to the skin .
fires could scarcely be lighted , and it was not until the storm had partly cleared away that the cooks could prepare anything to eat .
surely being a soldier was not all <name> after all .
it had been learned that a portion of the spanish army was less than four miles away , and general young was ordered by general wheeler to move forward at daybreak and engage the enemy .
colonel wood received orders to move the rough riders by a trail over a hill , beyond which the country sloped toward the bay and the city of <name> .
the first encounter with the enemy occurred at a place called la <unk> ( or las <unk> ) , so called on account of trees of that name growing in the vicinity .
here the spaniards had <unk> and mounds of earth to shelter them and had likewise the <unk> of a plantation .
they had been watching for the coming of the <unk> eagerly , and were determined to give our soldiers a lesson not to be forgotten .
they knew that our army had not been in active warfare for years , and felt certain that they would soon be able to make the " paper " soldiers retreat .
the rough riders found the way led up a steep hill , and the pace was so fast that before the firing line was reached some men fell out from exhaustion .
<name> <name> was at the head of the first squadron and did his best to urge those under him forward .
there was an advance guard , led by some men under sergeant hamilton fish , and captain <unk> 's troop , and soon a crash of firearms notified all that a fight was on .
orders were at once issued to fill the magazines of the guns , and this was done .
then , while some troops moved to the left of the trail , lieutenant-colonel <name> was ordered to take three troops to the right .
here the jungle was heavy , and no sooner had the rough riders advanced than the spaniards opened fire upon them .
in speaking of the opening of this fight , mr. <name> himself writes :  " the effect of the <unk> powder ( used by the enemy ) was remarkable .
the air seemed full of the rustling sound of the mauser bullets , for the spaniards knew the trails by which we were advancing , and opened heavily on our position .
but they themselves were entirely invisible .
the jungle covered everything , and not the faintest trace of smoke was to be seen in any direction , to indicate from whence the bullets came . "
it was certainly a trying time  to stand up and be shot at without being able to return the compliment .
<name> and all the other leaders knew that this would not do , and at a great risk they continued to advance , until some spaniards were at last discovered across a valley to the right of where the troops under lieutenant-colonel <name> were located .
" there they are ! "
was the cry .
" forward and at 'em , boys !
down with the dons ! "
without delay some sharpshooters fired on the spaniards , and then the regular troops opened up , and at last the spaniards ran from cover .
bullets were now flying in all directions , and both sides were making their shots tell .
the americans had but scant protection , and it was not long before a number of them fell .
some bullets came close to <name> <name> , and one hit a palm tree near where he was standing , filling his left eye and ear with the dust and splinters .
had that mauser bullet come a few inches closer , the man who was destined to become the future president of our country might have been killed on the spot .
in the midst of the skirmish  for the conflict proved to be nothing more  there was a report that colonel wood was dead , and <name> <name> took it upon himself to restore the fighting line of rough riders to order .
but happily the report proved false ; and a little while after this the skirmish came to an end , and both spaniards and americans betook themselves to positions of greater safety .
in this skirmish , brief as it was , the rough riders lost eight men killed and nearly forty wounded .
chapter xv along the jungle trail  fording the river  opening of the battle of san <name> hill  bravery of the rough riders  personal experiences of <name> <name> during the battle taken as a whole , the skirmish at la <unk> was quite an important one , for it showed the spaniards that our soldiers were bound to advance upon <name> , be the cost what it might .
more than this , it showed that <name> <name> was brave under fire .
during the skirmish he paid but scant attention to his own personal safety .
he went wherever he thought he was needed , and the fact that mauser bullets were flying about in all directions did not <unk> him .
" he was about as cool a man as i ever saw in a fight , " said one old soldier .
" he did all he could to encourage the men , and had a kind word for every man he ran across who was wounded .
once , in the thickest of the brush , he grabbed up a gun and began to shoot with us , and i reckon he fired as straight as anybody there , for he had had lots of practice while hunting . "
the spaniards had been driven from their pits and from the <unk> of the plantation , and now took good care to keep out of sight .
<unk> were thrown out by the officers of the army , and those who had been in the fight took a <unk> rest , and looked after the dead and wounded .
there was certainly a touching scene at the temporary hospital , where one soldier started to sing " my country , 't is of thee , " and many others joined in .
on the following morning the dead were buried , the men gathering around the one common grave to sing " rock of ages " in a manner that brought tears to the eyes of many .
from la <unk> the rough riders moved to the bank of a small stream in the neighborhood .
part of the army was ahead of them and the rest behind , and for several days nothing unusual occurred .
but during that time general young caught the fever , whereupon colonel wood had to take charge of the brigade , and lieutenant-colonel <name> took command of the rough riders .
it was now the end of <name> , and the weather was anything but agreeable .
when the rain did not come down in torrents , the sun shone with a glare and a heat that was terrific .
as said before , the uniforms of the rough riders were heavy , and much clothing had to be cast aside as unfit for use .
to add to the discomfort , rations that were promised failed to appear , so that a good square meal was almost unknown .
" this <name> not do ; the men must have enough to eat , even if i have to buy it for them , " said acting colonel <name> , and made two trips down to the seacoast in search of beans , tomatoes , and other things to eat .
here he was informed that he could only buy stuff meant for the officers .
" all right ; i 'll buy the things for the officers , " he answered , and purchased as much as they would allow .
when he got back , he turned the food over to the officers , but saw to it that they gave their men a fair share .
" it was a kindness none of his men ever forgot , " said a soldier who was there .
" it was n't any of his business to buy the grub ,  the <unk> department had to supply it free ,  but he knew we might starve while the department was getting itself straightened out and ready to do the right thing .
before he went on a hunt for food , all we had was salt pork , <unk> , and coffee , and some of the stuff was n't fit to put in your mouth . "
and this testimony was the testimony of scores of others .
the spaniards were strongly intrenched upon the outskirts of <name> , and as it was a rough , hilly country , with many shallow streams and much jungle , it was hard for the american army to advance .
it was general <unk> 's idea to form a grand semicircle around <name> , starting from el <unk> on the north , and running in an irregular line to <unk> on the south .
throughout this territory the spaniards had done everything possible to hinder the advance of our troops .
barbed wire was strung in many directions , and often the brushwood would conceal dangerous pitfalls , so that any advance had to be made with great caution .
the attack upon the spanish lines began on july 1 , and the fighting took place in several quarters at once , but was unusually heavy at el <unk> and at san <name> hill .
at el <unk> the heroic general lawton was in command , and fought as gallantly as he afterward did in the philippines .
some of the charges were terrific , and <name> ever be remembered by those who participated in them .
the rough riders struck camp and moved along the trail on the last day of <name> .
it was as hot as ever , with no sign of rain .
the trail was filled with troops and provision wagons , and the progress , consequently , was slow .
" let us get into the fight ! "
was the cry heard on every side .
" don't keep us waiting any longer . "
" keep cool , " said one of the officers .
" you 'll get all the fighting you want soon . "
and so it proved .
at a little after eight o'clock in the evening the rough riders found themselves on el <unk> hill , and here the whole brigade to which they were attached went into camp .
" it was n't much of a camp , " said one who was there .
" we just threw out a strong <unk> and went to sleep on our arms , and glad of it , after that day in the broiling sun .
we had had to ford some pretty muddy streams , and all of us were water and mud up to our knees .
but everybody was as enthusiastic to fight as ever . "
at sunrise the battle opened at el <unk> , and the rough riders could hear the booming of cannon .
at once all was activity , and the men prepared to move ahead at a moment 's notice .
acting colonel <name> was with colonel wood at the time , and both were listening to the roar of the artillery .
" i wish we could move  " began colonel wood , when , of a sudden , both he and <name> <name> heard a strange humming sound in the air .
then came the explosion of a shrapnel shell over their heads , and both leaped to their feet .
" this is getting warm ! "
cried <name> <name> , and ran toward his horse , when boom !
came another explosion , and one of the bullets fell upon his wrist , making , as he himself says , " a bump about as big as a hickory nut . "
this same shell , he adds , wounded four of the men under him and two or three regulars , one of whom lost his leg .
certainly another providential escape on the part of the future president .
without loss of time <name> <name> ordered his troops into the underbrush , and here , for the time being , they were safe .
on account of the <unk> powder they used , the spanish batteries could not be precisely located , so our own artillery were at a slight disadvantage .
but now the blood of the americans was fully aroused , and soon came an order for a general advance ,  something that was hailed with wild delight by the rough riders .
" hurrah , now we 'll show 'em what the yankees can do ! "
was the cry .
" down with the dons !
three cheers for uncle <name> ! "
the rough riders had to ford the river , and while they were doing this , a balloon that had been used for observations came down in that vicinity and attracted the attention of the spanish sharpshooters .
the firing was now heavy on all sides , and many a gallant soldier went down to rise no more .
then came another wait of an hour , during which the rough riders rested in a hollow leading up from the river .
again there was grumbling .
with so much fighting on all sides , why could they not advance ?
" we 'll get our turn , " said <name> <name> .
and soon after a staff officer dashed up with orders to move forward and support the cavalry of the regular army on the hills in front .
" now to the front ! "
was the cry .
" down with the dons ! "
and away went troop after troop on the double-quick , with acting colonel <name> leading them .
shot and shell were hurling themselves through the air in all directions , and on all sides could be heard the shrieks and groans of the dead and the dying .
it was a time long to be remembered .
men went down in all directions , and with them not a few officers .
it was so hot that <name> 's orderly was prostrated from the heat and afterward died .
<name> summoned another rough rider , and had just finished giving the man some orders when the soldier pitched forward upon his commander , killed by a bullet through the throat .
as the troops advanced , <name> <name> urged his men forward and told them to do their best , to which they responded with a cheer .
he was on horseback at the time , and soon came across a man lying in the shade , probably overcome by the heat .
he started to speak to the rough rider when a bullet hit the fellow and killed him on the spot .
" i suppose that bullet was meant for me , " says mr. <name> , in writing of this incident .
" i , who was on horseback in the open , was unhurt , and the man lying flat on the ground in the cover beside me was killed . "
the fight had now centred around the possession of san <name> hill , upon which was located a spanish <unk> .
the bullets were flying as thickly as ever , when <name> was ordered to advance in support of another regiment .
as the rough riders reached the spot where the other regiment was , they found the men lying down awaiting orders .
" i am ordered to support your regiment , " said <name> <name> to the first captain he met .
" we are awaiting orders to advance , " answered the captain of the regulars .
" in my opinion we can not take these hills by firing at them , " returned the commander of the rough riders .
" we must rush them . "
" my orders are to keep my men where they are . "
" where is your colonel ? "
" i do n't know . "
" well , if he is n't here , then i am the ranking officer , and i give the order to charge , " came quickly and positively from <name> <name> .
" well , sir ,  i  i have orders from our colonel  " began the captain of the regulars .
" if you wo n't charge , let my men pass through , sir , " cut in the acting colonel of the rough riders , and he ordered his men to move to the front .
this was too much for the regulars , and up they sprang with shouts and yells , and rough riders and regulars went up san <name> hill together .
<name> was on horseback as before , but at a <unk> fence he leaped to the ground , swung his hat in the air , and joined his men on foot .
the fight was now at its <unk> , and men were being <unk> down in all directions .
but the fever of battle was in the veins of all the american soldiers , and nothing could stop them .
up the hill they went , loading and firing at random , and making as many shots as possible tell .
the spaniards were in retreat , and soon old <name> was planted in several places .
some of the leading officers had been shot , and <name> <name> found himself at one time in command of five regiments , and doing his best to keep them in military order .
strange as it may seem , with bullets flying all around him , he remained unharmed , saving for some slight scratches which , he tells us , " were of no consequence . "
with the top of the hill gained , the american soldiers could get a distant glimpse of <name> , several miles away , and some wanted to move still farther forward .
but the spaniards had strong intrenchments to fall back upon , and it was deemed best to " let well enough alone . "
accordingly the american line was made as strong as possible , and by nightfall the battle was at an end , and the rough riders were told to hold the hill and <unk> , and they did so .
in the <unk> they found some food belonging to some spanish officers , and upon this they feasted after their <unk> victory .
chapter xvi results of the fight  life in the trenches  the spanish fleet in <name> harbor  another great naval victory  the rough riders and the spanish <unk> the fight had been a hard and heavy one .
the rough riders had gone into the engagement just <unk> strong , and of that number 89 were killed or wounded .
the total loss to the americans was <unk> killed and wounded .
the loss to the spanish was also heavy , but the exact figures <name> probably never be known .
utterly tired out with their marching and fighting , the rough riders intrenched as best they could , cared for their wounded and dead , and then dropped down to get a <unk> rest .
the night was <name> and cold , and many who had been bathed in perspiration suffered accordingly .
<name> <name> had a blanket taken from the spanish , and in this he rolled himself , and slept with others of his command .
at three o'clock in the morning came an unexpected alarm .
the spanish <unk> were out in force , trying to drive the americans back .
but there was no heavy attack , and presently all became as quiet as before .
" they 'll not give up yet , " said one of the officers of the rough riders .
" they mean to <unk> this hill if they can . "
just at daybreak the spaniards opened the attack on san <name> hill once more .
<name> <name> was resting under a little tree when a shrapnel shell burst close by , killing or wounding five men of the command .
he at once ordered the eight troops under him to a safer position , where the spanish battery and the sharpshooters could not locate them so readily .
if the fight had been hard , guarding the trenches was almost equally so .
the sun beat down fiercely , and the newly turned up earth made many of the rough riders sick .
added to this , provisions were , as usual , slow in arriving .
those in the trenches were kept there six hours , and then relieved by the others who were farther to the rear .
" running from the cover of brush to the trenches was no easy matter , " says one rough rider who was there .
" we had dug the trenches in a hurry , and had no passages from the rear leading to them .
all we could do was to wait for a signal , and then rush , and when we did that , the spaniards would open a hot fire and keep it up for perhaps fifteen minutes .
the sun was enough to turn a man 's <name> , and more than one poor fellow caught a fever there that proved fatal to him . "
through the entire day the firing continued , but no advances were made upon either side .
the americans were waiting for reinforcements , and the spaniards were doing likewise .
on our side a dynamite gun and two <unk> guns were used , but with little success .
but the gatling guns proved very effective , and caused a great loss to the enemy .
the city of <name> lies on the northeast coast of a large bay of the same name .
this bay is shaped somewhat like a bottle , with a long neck joining it to the <unk> sea .
in the harbor , at the time of the battles just described , the spaniards had a fleet of war-ships under the command of admiral cervera , an old and able naval commander .
in the fleet were four large cruisers and two <unk> .
three of the cruisers were of seven thousand tons burden each , and all could make from eighteen to nineteen knots an hour .
each carried a crew of about five hundred men , and all were well supplied with guns and ammunition .
to keep this fleet " bottled up , " our own navy had a fleet of its own just outside of the harbor , where it had been stationed ever since admiral cervera had been discovered within .
the american fleet consisted of the cruiser brooklyn , which was commodore schley 's <unk> , the battleships texas , iowa , indiana , and oregon ( the latter having sailed all the way from the pacific coast around cape horn to get into the fight ) , and the converted yachts gloucester and vixen .
there were also close at hand , but not near enough to get into the fight , the cruiser new york , admiral sampson 's <unk> , and several other vessels of lesser importance .
for a long time it had been thought that cervera would try to escape from the harbor , in which he could not be reached because of the strong forts that protected the entrance .
to bottle him up more effectively , the americans tried to block up the harbor entrance by sinking an old iron steamboat , the merrimac , in the channel .
this heroic work was undertaken by lieutenant hobson with a crew of seven daring men , but the plan failed , for the merrimac , instead of sinking where intended , swung to one side of the main channel .
when it was reported to him that the americans had taken the heights of el <unk> and san <name> and were strongly intrenched in their positions , admiral cervera concluded that <name> bay might soon become too hot to hold him .
the capture of the city would be followed by the taking of the forts at the harbor entrance , and then there would be nothing left for him to do but to surrender .
san <name> and el <unk> had been taken on friday , and all day saturday occurred the shooting at long range , as already described .
in the meantime the war-ships outside of the harbor kept up a close watch on the harbor entrance , lying well out during the day , but coming in closer at night , and using their powerful <unk> from sundown to sunrise .
<name> dawned bright and clear , and for the time being all was quiet both ashore and afloat .
in the trenches the rough riders and other soldiers were still on guard , doing what they could for their wounded , and trying to get the rations which were still delayed .
presently , those on board of the american fleet noticed a thick cloud of smoke hanging over the harbor , coming from the funnels of the spanish war-ships .
then one of the enemy 's vessels showed itself , quickly followed by the others , and all turned westward , to escape up the coast .
" the enemy is escaping ! "
was the signal hoisted .
and then one cannon after another boomed out , giving the signal to all our ships in that vicinity .
the booming of the cannon was heard away eastward at <unk> , whither admiral sampson had gone with his ship to confer with general <unk> , and without delay the new york raced madly back to get into the fight that followed .
" remember the maine !  " was the cry .
" down with the spanish ships !
give 'em what <name> did ! "
and this cry , " give 'em what <name> did ! "
was heard on every hand .
the first vessel to go down was a torpedo-boat , sunk by the gloucester , and this was quickly followed by the sinking of the second torpedo-boat .
in the meantime the larger vessels were pouring in their rain of steel upon the spanish cruisers with deadly effect , knocking great holes into the ships and killing scores of those on board .
the spanish cruiser <name> was the first to succumb to the heavy attack , and soon she turned in to shore to save her crew from drowning .
then the <unk> caught fire in several places , and burning fiercely from stem to stern , she , too , turned in .
but two ships were now left to admiral cervera , the vizcaya and the colon , and each had suffered much .
both were doing their best to get out of reach of our guns and the marvellous accuracy of our gunners .
" do n't let 'em get away ! "
was the cry .
" give 'em what <name> did ! "
forward went the war-ships of uncle <name> , the powerful oregon leading , with the brooklyn and texas not far behind .
the rain of steel continued , and at last , burning like her sister ships , the vizcaya turned shoreward , and many of her crew leaped overboard to save their lives .
only the colon now remained .
she was still in fair condition , and it was the spaniards ' ardent <name> to save at least one ship from the dire calamity that had overtaken them .
but this was not to be , and after a run of a few miles , during which the oregon and brooklyn continued to pound her with shot and shell , the spanish flag was lowered , and the colon also ran ashore .
it was assuredly a mighty victory , a fitting mate to the great victory won by admiral <name> , and when the news reached our country there was such a fourth of july celebration everywhere as <name> never be forgotten .
twice had our navy met the ships of spain , and each time we had sunk every vessel without losing any of our own .
more than this , while the spaniards had lost many men through shot and fire and drowning , our total loss was but one man killed and a handful wounded .
the loss of her second fleet was a bitter blow to spain , and many predicted that the war would not continue much longer , and this prediction proved correct .
during the rush made by the rough riders and our other soldiers , they had gone right through several bodies of spanish <unk> who were secreted in the trees of the jungle .
these <unk> , really lawless fellows belonging to no particular command , could not get back into <name> because of the strong american guard at the intrenchments , and consequently they contented themselves with remaining out of sight and <unk> our soldiers whenever the opportunity offered .
" this <name> not do , " said <name> <name> .
" they are shooting down our men without giving them a chance to fire back .
we 'll have to get after them . "
and without delay he sent out a detachment of the best rough rider shots to be found .
these sharpshooters searched the jungle back of the intrenchments thoroughly , and as a result killed eleven of the <unk> and wounded many more .
after that the <unk> kept their distance , satisfied that the yankees could beat them at their own game .
chapter xvii devotion of the rough riders to <name> <name>  his kindness to his men  last of the fighting  the truce and treaty of peace with the defeat of admiral cervera 's fleet , a flag of truce was sent into <name> by the commander of our army , demanding the surrender of the city .
while these negotiations were pending , all fighting came to an end , and the rough riders had but little to do outside of making themselves comfortable and caring for the many who were getting sick because of the lack of shelter and proper food .
food was now coming in more rapidly , and soon all were supplied with tents and blankets .
during this time <name> <name> 's personal baggage appeared , and he celebrated the arrival by treating himself to a shave and a change of linen , something impossible to do since the fighting had begun .
in his own writings , mr. <name> has spoken at great length of the devotion which all of the rough riders displayed toward him .
they were anxious to wait on him at all hours of the day and night .
some would pitch his tent , others would clean his weapons , and still others would go hunting and bring in such game as the vicinity afforded .
when ordered to do anything , there was rarely a grumble .
those in the hospital bore their sufferings with remarkable fortitude .
in return for this , <name> <name> did all he could to make life less hard for those under him .
the game that was brought to him he sent to the hospital , that the wounded might have proper nourishment ; and he either went himself or sent somebody to the seacoast , to purchase food which the <unk> department possessed , but which , through lack of organization , it was slow in distributing .
when no shelter was to be had , he slept on the ground with his men , and when they had to work on the trenches at night , he was up and around superintending the labor .
" he was one of us , and he let us know it , " was said by one of the rough riders .
" he ate the same food we did , and he was mighty good to the sick and the wounded .
he paid for lots of things out of his own pocket , and i do n't believe he has ever asked uncle <name> to pay him back . "
there was no telling how soon the truce would come to an end and fighting would begin again , and night after night the rough riders were kept on guard .
there was a standing order that each fourth man should keep awake while the others slept , and no matter how dark or rainy the night , <name> <name> tramped around from one trench to another , seeing to it that this order was obeyed .
he also visited the intrenchments of other commands , to compare them and make certain that the grade of service was equally high among the rough riders .
this shows distinctly that he was a <unk> military commander .
the truce lasted a week , and while all operations were supposed to have come to an end , both the americans and the spaniards spent the time in strengthening their positions .
at one time the americans constructed a fairly good defence , in which they placed two gatling guns and two automatic colt guns , and this was named fort <name> , in honor of the rough rider commander .
on the tenth of july the fighting began once more , and again the batteries on both sides sent shot and shell into the camps of the enemy .
it was largely fighting at long range , and the only rough riders who took part were those who manned the colt 's guns , and a small body of sharpshooters stationed in a trench well to the front .
on the next day the rough riders were ordered northward , to guard the road running from <name> to el <unk> .
here some fighting was in progress , and the troopers expected to get into battle once more .
but the skirmish came to an end before they arrived , very much to their disappointment .
hardly had the rough riders settled in their new position than a storm came up which proved to be the heaviest yet experienced during the campaign .
while <name> <name> was sleeping in his tent , the shelter was blown down and away , and all of his personal effects were scattered in the mud and wet .
as best he could , he donned his clothing , saw to it that his men were safe , and then betook himself to a kitchen tent , where he finished the sleep of that night on a rude table recently taken from an abandoned spanish home in that vicinity .
" on that night it rained cats and dogs and <unk> , " said one of the soldiers afterward .
" it was inky dark  darker than i have ever known it to be anywhere on the plains .
the water made a muddy pond of the whole camp , and the trenches were half filled in no time .
everything was blown <unk> by the furious wind , and some of our outfits we never recovered .
in the midst of the confusion some fellows reported that the spaniards were trying to break through our lines , but the report was false ,  the outsiders were starving cubans who had come in looking for shelter and something to eat .
we gave them what we could  which was precious little , for we had next to nothing ourselves  and then got them to help us get things together again .
one of the cubans was an old man , who could speak a little english .
he said he had lost two daughters and three grandchildren by starvation since the war between spain and cuba had started .
he himself was little more than a skeleton . "
that <name> <name> was <unk> enough to look out for other soldiers besides those of his own command is proven by what took place on the day following the big storm .
next to the rough riders were located a regiment of illinois volunteers .
because of the muddy roads and swollen streams , they could get no rations , and scant as were their own supplies , colonel <name> had the rough riders furnish them with beans , coffee , and a few cases of <unk> , for which they were extremely grateful .
later in the day the commander of the rough riders also got to them part of a mule train of provisions .
the american position had been greatly strengthened , and many additional troops were now at the front .
it was felt that an advance upon <name> would surely result in victory , although the losses might be large .
but the spaniards were no longer in a position to continue the struggle , and on july 17 the city formally surrendered .
the surrendered territory covered many miles , and the spanish soldiers to lay down their arms numbered upward of twenty thousand .
there was great cheering in the american trenches when the glad news was brought in , and soon old <name> was planted on every height , while the trumpets sounded out triumphantly .
possession of <name> was immediate , and in a few hours the stars and stripes floated from the flagstaff of the civil government buildings .
our gallant army had won on the land just as our gallant navy had won on the sea .
the war had been , for us , one of triumph from start to finish .
in foreign countries the news was received with an astonishment that can scarcely be described .
after <name> 's wonderful victory in manila bay , many naval experts said that such a fight could not be duplicated , yet it was duplicated two months later off <name> bay in a manner that left no doubt of american supremacy on the sea .
then when it came to fighting on land , our army was designated as " paper " soldiers , that is , soldiers on paper or in name only , and it was said that their guns would be found of little use against the <unk> of spain .
but this was likewise false ; and to-day the army and navy of the united states are respected everywhere .
and more than this , foreign powers have come to our country for many of their war-ships , asking us to build and equip them , and also asking us to make cannon and rifles for them .
while the war was on in cuba , a part of the united states army under general miles was sent to porto <name> , another island belonging to spain .
here the inhabitants hailed the americans with delight , and the resistance by the spanish soldiers was only <unk> .
with the downfall of the navy and <name> , spain knew not what to do next , and gladly received the terms of peace offered by president <name> and his advisers .
the terms were accepted on <name> 9 , and thus the short but sharp war came to a termination .
by the treaty of peace cuba was given her <name> , and porto <name> and the philippines passed into the possession of the united states .
chapter xviii last days in cuba  the departure for home  arrival at <unk>  caring for the sick and wounded  presentation to <name> <name> by his men  <unk> of the rough riders four days after the surrender of <name> the rough riders found themselves in the hills four or five miles back from the intrenchments they had occupied during the last fight .
other commands were scattered in various directions , for to let them go into the wretched city would have been out of the question .
<name> was dirty in the extreme ; the fever was there , and hundreds were on the verge of starvation .
it was a trying time for everybody , and equally so for <name> <name> , who did all in his power , as before , to make his men comfortable .
when it did not rain , the sun came out fiercely , causing a rapid evaporation that was thoroughly exhausting to the soldiers .
the locality was not a healthy one , and soon scores of rough riders and others were down with <unk> or fever .
doctors and surgeons were scarce , and hospital accommodations were scanty , and again and again did colonel <name> send down on his own account to the seacoast and to <name> for food and medicines of which his command were in dire need .
he was now colonel of the rough riders in reality , his promotion having been granted to him just one week after the heroic charge up san <name> hill .
his old colonel , wood , was installed at <name> as military governor .
this , for the time being , left colonel <name> in command of the cavalry brigade , no small honor to one who had been , but a few months before , a stranger to military duties .
during this time in camp , <name> <name> visited <name> and the forts at the entrance to the harbor , and with the pen of a skilled author he has , in one of his books , given us vivid pictures of the sights to be seen there at that time  the crooked streets with their queer shops , the wretched inhabitants , the grim and frowning forts , all hemmed in by the towering mountains and the sea .
he likewise tells of his trips to the mountains , and how his companions were usually exhausted by the climbing done .
for one who in his youth had been so delicate , he stood the exposure remarkably well , for which he was thankful .
for some time the authorities at washington did not know what to do with the troops in cuba .
it was suggested that they move up to higher ground , or to another neighborhood .
but general <unk> knew , and so did all of the officers under him , that to keep the army in the island would only mean more sickness and death .
" i <name> go to the general with a protest , " said colonel <name> .
and he did so .
meanwhile the other head officers <name> up a letter of protest , and this was signed by all , including the commander of the rough riders .
in his own letter <name> protested against the treatment of his men in the matter of rations , clothing , and hospital accommodations , and in the other letter , called by the officers a round <name> , there was a protest about remaining in cuba longer , with the fever getting worse every day .
these letters were made public through the press of the united states , with the result that the troops were ordered home without further delay .
the rough riders left cuba on <name> 7 , just six weeks and a half after landing .
the time spent in the island had been short , but to many it seemed an age .
none were sorry to depart , although sad to think that some of the sick had to be left behind .
the transport used this time was the <unk> , and mr. <name> tells us that , taken as a whole , the accommodations were better than they had been on the <unk> .
but on the trip much trouble was had with some of the <unk> and engineers , who insisted upon drinking some liquor smuggled aboard .
" i <name> not permit this , " said colonel <name> .
and he read the disorderly ones a strong lecture and made them give up their liquor .
after that , as there was much grumbling , he set a guard ; and that was the end of that trouble .
the destination of the transport was <unk> , on the extreme eastern shore of long island .
the trip took nine days ,  rather a dreary time to those anxious to see their native land once more .
when an anchorage was gained , a gunboat came out to the transport with the welcome news that spain had agreed to our terms .
the sick had still to be cared for ; yet , taken as a whole , the month spent at the camp at <unk> was pleasant enough .
here colonel <name> met that part of the regiment that had been left behind in <name> , and all the stories of the fights had to be told over and over again .
" it was good to meet the rest of the regiment , " says mr. <name> , in his book .
" they all felt dreadfully at not having been in cuba .
of course those who stayed had done their duty precisely as did those who went . "
which was true ; yet , as he adds , those who had been left behind could not be comforted .
colonel <name> was still in charge of the brigade while at <unk> , and much of his time was taken up in getting out necessary reports , and seeing to it that the entire camp was kept in first-class sanitary condition .
" and he was up to the <name> , " said one of those who were there .
" he did n't allow the least bit of dirt , and everything had to be as <unk> as if we were at west point .
and it was a good thing , too , for it kept the sickness from spreading . "
the <unk> is strong at <unk> , and this soon began to tell upon all who were sick , putting in them new life and vigor .
here every possible attention was given to those who were down , so that ere long many were up again and as well as ever .
when he had a little time to himself , <name> <name> would gather a few friends around him , and either go to the beach to bathe or go off on a long horseback ride .
war was to him a thing of the past , and he was once more willing to become a private citizen as of old .
in those days the camp at <unk> was constantly crowded with visitors from new york city and elsewhere , who poured in upon every train .
all of the soldiers who had been to cuba were hailed as heroes , and had to tell their stories many times .
" every soldier had a crowd following him , " said one private .
" the visitors wanted to know how we had fought , how we had been treated by the government , how things looked in cuba , and a hundred and one other things .
most of the visitors , especially the ladies , wanted our autographs , and i had to write mine as many as forty times a day .
i remember one of the men , a cowboy from oklahoma , could n't write , and he got so upset over this that every time somebody asked him for his autograph he would run away , saying he had forgotten to do something that he had been ordered to do .
when i and some chums went down to new york to look around , all the folks stared at us , and many insisted on shaking hands and treating . "
[ illustration : colonel <name> at <unk> point .
( photograph by <unk> <unk> , new york. ) ] the uniforms the rough riders had worn in cuba were in rags , and many had boarded the transport barefooted .
the rags were saved as trophies of the occasion , and many are still in existence .
at camp <unk> , as the place was called , there was a large hospital for the sick , and to this many came to do what they could for the sufferers , who were now given every possible attention .
among the visitors was miss <name> gould , who had used her ample means for the benefit of the sick all through the war , and who now continued to play the good <unk> .
president <name> and many of his cabinet likewise visited the camp , and saw to it that everything in the hospital and out of it was as it should be .
the sick were presented with the best of fruits and other things , and many ladies assisted the nurses by reading to the patients and by writing letters for them .
now that they had nothing to do in the shape of fighting , many of the rough riders were anxious to get back to the wild west .
life in an ordinary camp did not suit them , and at every available opportunity they indulged in " horse play , " working off many practical jokes upon each other .
one day a report went the rounds that a member of another cavalry organization could not master a certain horse that had been assigned to him .
the report was true , for the horse was what is called by ranchmen a " bad <unk> . "
" i think sergeant <name> can master him , " said colonel <name> .
he referred to one of the best " bronco <unk> " among the rough riders , a man who had never yet allowed a steed to get the best of him .
" all right , let <name> try him , " said others .
and a test was arranged for the day following .
at that time secretary of war <unk> was in camp , and a great crowd of visitors , military men and others , gathered before colonel <unk> quarters to watch the contest .
at the proper time the vicious horse was brought forth , and watching his chance , sergeant <name> leaped upon his back .
then came such a <unk> , leaping , and prancing as many had never witnessed before .
" he 'll be killed ! "
cried many of the ladies .
" the horse <name> have him under in another moment . "
but such fears were groundless .
<name> knew exactly what he was doing , and in the end the fiery steed had to give in , completely conquered .
on the last <name> in camp , chaplain brown delivered an impressive sermon , to which all listened with grave attention .
after he had finished , <name> <name> spoke to the men in a feeling way .
" i told them how proud i was of them , " he says .
" but warned them not to think that they could go back and rest on their laurels , bidding them remember that though for ten days or so the world would be willing to treat them as heroes , yet after that time they would find they would have to get down to hard work just like anybody else , unless they were willing to be regarded as worthless <unk> . "
this was the best possible advice , and it is believed that many of the soldiers profited by it .
before the men were mustered out , they treated their beloved commander to a genuine surprise .
they had had a fine bronze of a " bronco <name> " made , and this was presented to colonel <name> on behalf of the whole regiment .
it touched him deeply , and to-day this bronze is one of his most highly prized gifts .
at last came news that the rough riders would be mustered out of the united states service the next day .
that evening a great celebration took place , in which all of the men joined , each according to his own notion of what a celebration should be .
large bonfires were lit , and here some delivered speeches , the soldiers from the colleges sang , those with indian blood in them gave a characteristic dance , and cowboys and ranchmen did " <unk> " and " cut up " as suited them .
on the morning of <name> 15 , four months after the rough riders had been organized , the colors were lowered in camp , the men were mustered out , and officers and privates shook hands and said good-by .
" it was the greatest sight i ever saw , " says one of the number .
" not until that moment came did we realize what it meant to part with those who had fought with us in battle and suffered the hardships of life in the trenches .
strange friendships had been formed , some between those who were very <name> and very poor , and others between those who were well educated and very ignorant .
one man who was studying for a professional life had as his particular chum a rough cowboy who had never spent six months over his books .
but the two had stood by each other and suffered , and i really believe they were willing to lay down their lives for each other .
" many of the men could hardly bear to part with colonel <name> .
he had stuck by them through thick and thin , and they worshipped him .
some shook hands half a dozen times , and some hardly dared to speak for fear of breaking down .
i never expect to see the match of that scene again . "
chapter xix nominated for governor of new york  a rough rider way of <unk>  elected governor  important work at albany  the homestead at oyster bay  chopping down a tree for exercise the war with spain was at an end , and uncle <name> had now to turn his attention to the philippines , where for many months to come military disturbances of a more or less serious nature were to take place .
<name> <name> might have remained in the army , and had he done so there is no doubt but that he would have swiftly risen to a rank of importance .
but the people of the state of new york willed otherwise .
" he is a great military man , " they said .
" but he was likewise a fine police commissioner and a civil service commissioner , fighting continually for what was right and good .
let us make him our next governor . "
the convention that nominated <name> <name> for the highest office in the empire state met at <unk> , <name> 27 , 1898 , just twelve days after the rough riders were mustered out .
at that time <name> s. black was governor of the state , having been elected two years before by a large majority .
the governor had many friends , and they said he deserved another term .
" <name> is not a citizen of this state , " said they .
" he gave up his residence here when he went to washington to become assistant secretary of the navy . "
" we do n't want him anyway , " said other politicians , who had not forgotten how the rough rider had acted when in the assembly .
" if he gets into office , it <name> be impossible to manage him . "
and they worked night and day to defeat the hero of san <name> hill .
on the day of the convention , the hall where it was held was jammed with people .
the people were also crowded in the street outside , and on every hand were seen rough rider badges .
" it was a <name> crowd from top to bottom , " says one who was there .
" you heard his name everywhere  in the hotels , on the streets , no matter where you went .
every once in a while somebody would shout , 'three cheers for <name> ! '
and the cheers would be given with a <name> . "
as soon as the convention had settled down to business , governor black was put up for nomination , and then the hon .
<name> m. <unk> presented the name of <name> <name> .
he spoke of what had been done in cuba , and added :  " the rough riders endured no hardships nor dangers which were not shared by their colonel .
he helped them dig their ditches ; he stood beside them in the deadly dampness of the trenches .
no floored tent for him if his comrades must sleep on the ground and under the sky .
in that <unk> charge of the rough riders up the hill of san <name> , their colonel was a hundred feet in advance . "
there was a prolonged cheering when <name> <name> 's name was mentioned , and hundreds waved their handkerchiefs and flags .
other speeches followed , and at last came the voting .
out of the total number cast <name> <name> received seven hundred and fifty-three and governor black two hundred and eighteen .
" i move we make the nomination of <name> <name> unanimous ! "
cried judge <unk> , who had previously presented the name of governor black .
and amid continued cheering this was done .
<name> <name> had been nominated on the regular republican ticket .
in opposition , the democrats nominated <name> van <unk> , also well known , and likewise of as old dutch stock as <name> himself .
the campaign was a decidedly strenuous one .
the democrats made every effort to win , while on the other hand the republicans who had wanted governor black for another term did not give to mr. <name> the support promised when his nomination had been made unanimous .
" we shall be defeated , " said more than one friend to <name> .
" it seems a shame , but we can not arouse the party as it should be aroused . "
" i <name> see what i can do myself , " answered the former leader of the rough riders .
and he arranged to make a complete tour of the state , taking in almost every city and town of importance .
when some of the old campaign managers heard of this , they came to <name> in great alarm .
" you must n't do it , " they said .
" it <name> ruin you . "
" i <name> risk it , " was the answer of the candidate .
and forthwith he started on his tour , taking a handful of his rough rider friends with him .
it was a brilliant stroke on the part of <name> <name> , and it told tremendously in his favor .
wherever he went , the people turned out in large crowds to see him and to listen to what he or his rough rider companions had to say .
citizens by the hundred came up to shake him by the hand and wish him success .
parades were organized to do him honor , and at night there would be brilliant illuminations and fireworks .
" we have aroused the party , " said he , when the tour was at an end .
and so it proved .
although van <unk> was popular , <name> <name> was elected to the high office of governor by seventeen thousand plurality .
it was certainly a high position for such a young man to occupy .
he was barely forty years of age , yet as governor of new york he ruled twice as many people as did <name> washington when first president of the united states .
he entered on his new duties with as much zeal as he had displayed when organizing the rough riders , and in a few weeks had the reins of government well in hand .
it is said that while he was governor he was never surprised by those who opposed him .
when they wanted facts and figures he was able to produce them , and he never supported or <unk> a measure unless he was morally certain he was on the right side .
he was <unk> to the last degree , and what he said he meant .
during his term of office many measures of importance were considered , but in a work of this kind it is not necessary to go into details .
for several important offices he nominated men of his own selection , despite the protests of some older politicians , and these selections proved first-class .
during his term as governor , mr. <name> did a great work for many poor people in new york city , who worked in what are called " sweat shops , "  small , close quarters , not fit for working purposes , in which men , women , and children make clothing and other articles .
he enforced what was known as the factory law , and the owners of the " <unk> " had to seek larger and more sanitary quarters for their employees .
he also took a strong hand in reforming the administration of the canals , which had been <unk> and unfair .
but perhaps his greatest work was in behalf of a measure meant to make the great corporations of new york state pay their fair share of the general taxes .
in the past these corporations had had great rights conferred upon them , and they had paid little or nothing in return .
" this is unjust , " said governor <name> .
" they should pay their taxes just as the poorest citizen is compelled to pay his tax . "
when the corporations heard this , many of the men in control were furious , and they threatened the governor in all sorts of ways .
they would defeat him if he ever again came up for election , and defeat him so badly that he would never again be heard of .
" do as you please , gentlemen , " said the governor .
" i am here to do my duty , and i intend to do it . "
and he called an extra session of the legislature for that purpose .
it is said that much money was used by some corporations to defeat governor <name> 's <name> , but in the end a modified form of the <name> was passed .
since that time other bills along similar lines have become laws ; so that the great corporations have to pay millions of dollars which in the past they had escaped paying .
such measures are of immense benefit to the ordinary citizen , and for his share in this work <name> <name> deserves great credit .
it was while governor of new york that mr. <name> gave to the public his book entitled " the rough riders . "
it contains a history of that organization from his personal point of view , and makes the most fascinating kind of reading from beginning to end .
it was well received , and added not a little to the laurels of the writer as an author .
although much of his time was spent at albany as executive , <name> <name> had not given up the old homestead at oyster bay on long island , and thither he went for rest and recreation , taking his entire family , which , as has been said , consisted of his wife and six children , with him .
the old <name> homestead is on a hill about three miles distant from the village .
the road to the house winds upward through a wilderness of trees and brushwood .
at the top of the hill , where the house stands , is a cleared space , free to the strong breezes of long island sound .
it is on the north shore , about twenty-five miles from city hall , new york .
the house is a large , <unk> affair , with crossed <unk> , and a large semicircular veranda at one end .
inside there is a wide hall , and all the rooms are of good size , with broad windows and inviting open <unk> .
one room is fitted up as mr. <name> 's " den , " with many <unk> filled with books , and with rare prints of washington , <name> , and other <unk> on the walls , and with not a few trophies of the hunt added .
in this room mr. <name> has done much of his work as an author .
it is said that <name> <name> not only chopped wood for a living , but that he rather enjoyed the outdoor exercise .
be that as it may , it remains a fact that mr. <name> frequently goes forth into the woods on his estate to fell a tree , or split one up , just for the exercise thus afforded .
this he did while he was governor of new york , and once astonished some newspaper men who had come to see him on business by the dexterity with which he cut a large tree trunk in two .
he even invited his visitors to " take a hack at it " themselves , but they respectfully declined .
he still kept up his athletic exercise , and one of his favorite amusements was to go on long horseback rides , either alone , or with some relative or friend .
at other times he would go deep into the woods with his young sons , showing them how to bring down the nuts from the trees , or how to use their guns on any small game that chanced to show itself .
his family life was then , as it has always been , a happy one ; but of this let us speak later .

( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] chapter xx great reception to admiral <name>  governor <name> 's increased popularity  last annual message as governor  visit to chicago  remarkable speech on the strenuous life although the war with spain was over , the people of the united states had not forgotten the wonderful work accomplished by admiral <name> and his men at manila , and when the dauntless naval fighter returned to this country , people everywhere arose to do him honor .
" he well deserves it , " said governor <name> .
and he appointed <name> 29 and 30 , 1899 , as public holidays , to be observed throughout the entire state as days of general thanksgiving .
these days were commonly called " <name> days . "
the reception to the admiral and to the other naval heroes was to take place in new york and vicinity , and for many days the citizens were busy decorating their homes and places of business with flags and bunting and pictures , and immense signs of " welcome , " some in letters several feet long .
at the junction of broadway , fifth avenue , and twenty-third street , an immense triumphal arch was erected , and reviewing stands stretched along the line of parade for many miles .
on the day before the grand reception , governor <name> , with some members of his staff , called upon admiral <name> on board of the <name> , and offered the state 's greeting .
a pleasant time was had by all , and the governor assured the sea hero that the people of new york and vicinity were more than anxious to do him honor .
it had been arranged that a naval parade should be held on the first day of the reception , and a land parade on the day following .
the course of the naval parade was up the hudson river past <name> 's tomb , and the grand procession on the water included the <name> , the <unk> <unk> , and the new york , indiana , massachusetts , texas , brooklyn , and a large number of other war-ships of lesser importance , besides an immense number of private <unk> and other craft .
the day dawned clear and bright , and the banks of the hudson were lined from end to end with people .
when the procession of war-ships swept up the stream , loud was the applause , while flags waved everywhere , and whistles blew constantly .
when passing <name> 's tomb every war-ship fired a salute , and the mass of sound echoing across the water was positively deafening .
as the <name> swept up the river , fired her salute , and then came to anchor a short distance below the last resting-place of general <name> , admiral <name> stood on the bridge of his <unk> , a small , trim figure , with a smile and a wave of the hand for everybody .
the surging people could see him but indistinctly , yet there was much hand clapping , and throats grew sore with cheering .
but there was another figure in that naval parade , the person of one also dear to the hearts of the people .
it was the figure of <name> <name> , dressed , not as a rough rider , but as a civilian , standing at the rail of a steamer used by the new york state officials .
when the people saw and recognized that figure , the cheering was as wild as ever .
" it is <name> ! "
ran from mouth to mouth .
" the hero of san <name> hill ! "
" hurrah for the rough riders and their gallant leader ! "
came from others .
and the cheering was renewed .
in the evening there was a grand display of fireworks and illuminated floats .
the immense span of the brooklyn bridge was a mass of lights , and contained the words " welcome , <name> " in <unk> which covered several hundred feet .
all of the war-ships had their <unk> in operation , and it can truthfully be said that for once the metropolis was as light as day .
but all of this was as nothing compared with the land parade which followed .
never before had the streets of new york been so jammed with people .
at many points it was impossible to move , yet the crowds were good-natured and patriotic to the core .
the parade started at <unk> tomb and ended at washington square , and was between five and six hours in passing .
admiral <name> rode in a carriage with mayor van <unk> , and received another ovation .
at the triumphal arch the admiral reviewed the parade , and here he was accorded additional honors .
in this parade governor <name> rode on horseback , in civilian dress .
as he came down the street , the immense crowds recognized him from afar , and the hand clapping and cheering was tremendous , and lasted long after he was out of sight .
" it 's our own <name> <name> ! "
cried the more enthusiastic .
" hurrah for the governor !
hurrah for the colonel of the rough riders ! "
" hurrah for the coming president ! "
said another .
and he spoke better than he knew .
this demonstration came straight from the people 's heart , and it could not help but affect <name> <name> .
sitting astride of his <unk> horse like a veteran , he bowed right and left .
next to <name> , he was easily the greatest figure in the parade .
on <name> 3 , 1900 , governor <name> sent his last annual message to the state legislature .
it was an able document , and as it was now recognized everywhere that he was a truly national figure , it was given careful attention .
it treated of the corruption in canal management , of the franchise tax , of taxation in general , and a large portion was devoted to the trusts .
at that time the trusts were receiving great attention everywhere , and it was felt that what the governor had to say about them , that they were largely <unk> , that they <unk> the condition of their affairs , that they promoted unfair competition , and that they wielded increased power over the <unk> , was strictly true .
in chicago there is a wealthy organization known as the hamilton club , and the members were very anxious to have governor <name> as their guest on <unk> day , <name> 10 , 1899 .
a delegation went to new york to invite the governor , and he accepted the invitation with pleasure .
" the middle west is very dear to me , " said he .
" it <name> be a pleasure to meet my many friends there . "
of course he was expected to speak , and said the subject of his address would be " the strenuous life , "  certainly a subject close to his own heart , considering the life he himself had led .
when mr. <name> reached the metropolis of the great lakes , he found a large crowd waiting at the railroad station to receive him .
the reception committee was on hand , with the necessary coaches , and people were crowded everywhere , anxious to catch a sight of the man who had made himself famous by the advance up san <name> hill .
but for the moment governor <name> did not see the reception committee , nor did he see the great mass of people .
in a far corner of the platform he caught sight of six men , dressed in the faded and tattered uniform of the rough riders .
they were not men of wealth or position , but they were men of his old command , and he had not forgotten them .
" glad to see you , boys , glad to see you ! "
he shouted , as he <unk> his way toward them .
" come up here and shake hands . "
" glad to see you , colonel , " was the ready answer , and the faces of the men broke into broad smiles .
they shook hands readily , and willingly answered all of the questions the governor put to them .
he asked how each of them was doing , calling them by their names , and concluded by requesting them to come up to the <unk> later , " for an <unk> chat . "
" it was a great meeting , " said one who was there .
" before the train came in , those old rough riders were nervous and showed it .
they knew that <name> had become a great man , and they were just a little afraid he would pass them by .
when the meeting was over , they went off as happy as a lot of children , and one of them said , 'say , fellows , <name> 's just all right yet , ai n't he ? '
and another answered : <unk> you he would be .
he's a white man through and through , none whiter anywhere . ' "
the banquet was held in the <unk> theatre building , and was said to be the largest ever given in chicago .
many distinguished guests were present , both from the north and the south , and the place was a mass of flowers and brilliantly illuminated , while a fine orchestra discoursed music during the meal .
when <name> <name> arose to speak , there was cheering that lasted fully a quarter of an hour .
the speech made upon this occasion is one not likely to be forgotten .
previous to that time the word " strenuous " had been heard but seldom , but ever since it has stood for something definite , and is much in use .
in part mr. <name> spoke as follows :  " i wish to preach , not the doctrine of ignoble ease , but the doctrine of the strenuous life ; the life of toil and effort ; of labor and strife ; to preach that highest form of success which comes , not to the man who desires mere easy peace , but to the man who does not shirk from danger , from hardship , or from bitter toil , and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph . "
another paragraph is equally interesting and elevating :  " we do not admire the man of timid peace .
we admire the man who <unk> victorious effort ; the man who never wrongs his neighbor , who is prompt to help a friend ; but who has those <unk> qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life .
it is hard to fail ; but it is worse never to have tried to succeed . "
and to this he adds :  " as it is with the individual so it is with the nation .
it is a base untruth to say that happy is the nation that has no history .
thrice happy is the nation that has a glorious history .
far better is it to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs , even though checkered by failure , than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much , because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat .

[ illustration : <name> <name> ] chapter xxi the convention at philadelphia  <name> <name> seconds the nomination of president <name>  becomes candidate for the <unk>  remarkable tours through many states as the time came on to nominate parties for the office of president and vice-president of the united states , in 1900 , there was considerable speculation in the republican party regarding who should be chosen for the second name on the ticket .
it was felt by everybody that president <name> had honestly earned a second term , not alone by his management of the war with spain , but also because of his stand touching the rebellion in the philippines , and on other matters of equal importance .
about the <unk> the political managers were not so sure , and they mentioned several names .
but in the hearts of the people there was but one name , and that was <name> <name> .
" we must have him , " was heard upon every side .
" he <name> be just the right man in the right place .
he <name> give to the office an importance never before attached to it , and an importance which it deserves . "
personally , governor <name> did not wish this added honor .
as the executive of the greatest state in our union , he had started great reforms , and he wanted to finish them .
" my work is here , " he said to many .
" let me do what i have been called to do , and then i <name> again be at the service of the whole nation once more . "
the national republican convention met in philadelphia , <name> 19 , in exposition hall , beautifully decorated with flags and banners .
senator <name> <name> , president <name> 's warmest personal friend , was chairman , and the delegates , numbering over seven hundred , came , as usual at such conventions , from every state in the union .
governor <name> himself was a delegate , and sat near the middle aisle , five or six seats from the front .
he was recognized by everybody , and it is safe to say that he was the most conspicuous figure at the convention .
up to the last minute many of the political leaders were , in a measure , afraid of <name> <name> .
they understood his immense popularity , and were afraid that the convention might be " <unk> " in his favor .
" if they once start to yell for <name> , it <name> be good-by to everybody else , " said one old politician .
" they are just crazy after the leader of the rough riders . "
but this man did not understand the stern moral honesty of the man under consideration .
<name> believed in <unk> <name> <name> , and had said so , and it was no more possible for him to seek the presidential nomination by an underhanded trick than it was for president <name> to do an equally base thing when he was asked to allow his name to be mentioned at the time he had pledged himself to support <name> <name> .
[ 2 ] both men were of equal loyalty , and the word of each was as good as his bond .
[ footnote 2 : see " american boys ' life of <name> <name> , " p .
191 . ]
it was senator <unk> who put up president <name> for nomination , and the vigorous cheering at that time <name> never be forgotten .
fifteen thousand throats yelled themselves hoarse , and then broke into the ringing words and music of " the union forever ! "
in a manner that made the very convention hall tremble .
then came cries for <name> , " for our own <name> of the rough riders ! "
and , written speech in hand , he arose amid that vast multitude to second the <unk> of <name> <name> .
not once did he look at the paper he held in his hand , but with a force that could not be misunderstood he addressed the assemblage .
" i rise to second the nomination of <name> <name> , because with him as a leader this people has trod the path of national greatness and prosperity with the strides of a giant , " said he , " and because under him we can and <name> succeed in the election .
exactly as in the past we have remedied the evils which we undertook to remedy , so now when we say that a wrong shall be righted , it most assuredly <name> be righted .
" we stand on the threshold of a new century , a century big with the fate of the great nations of the earth .
it rests with us to decide now whether in the opening years of that century we shall march forward to fresh triumphs , or whether at the outset we shall deliberately cripple ourselves for the contest . "
his speech was the signal for another burst of applause , and when finally <name> <name> was named as the candidate for vice-president , the crowd yelled until it could yell no longer , while many sang " yankee <unk> " and other more or less patriotic airs , keeping time with canes and <unk> .
when the vote was cast , only one delegate failed to vote for <name> <name> , and that was <name> <name> himself .
the platform of the party was largely a repetition of the platform of four years before .
again the cry was for " sound money , " and for the continuance of president <name> 's policy in the philippines .
the campaign which followed was truly a strenuous one  to use a favorite word of the candidate .
president <name> decided not to make many speeches , and thus the hard work previous to election day fell upon <name> <name> .
he did not shirk the task .
as with everything he undertook , he entered into the campaign with vigor , resolved to deserve success even if he did not win it .
" i <name> do my best in the interests of our party , and for the benefit of the people at large , " said <name> <name> .
" no man can do more than that . "
in the few short months between the time when he was nominated and when the election was held , governor <name> travelled over 20,000 miles by rail , visiting nearly 600 towns , and addressing , on a rough estimate , fully <unk> of people !
in that time he delivered <unk> speeches , some of them half an hour and some an hour in length .
in his thousands of miles of travel the candidate for the <unk> visited many states , particularly those lying between new york and colorado .
at nearly every town he was greeted by an immense crowd , all anxious to do the leader of the rough riders honor .
in the large cities great banquets were held , and he was shown much respect and consideration .
in many places those who had fought under him came to see and listen to him , and these meetings were of especial pleasure .
often he would see an old rough rider hanging back in the crowd , and would call him to the front or do his best to reach the <unk> and shake him by the hand .
one occurrence is worthy of special mention .
the democratic party had nominated <name> <unk> <name> as their candidate for president .
there was a great labor picnic and demonstration at chicago , and both governor <name> and mr. <name> were invited to speak .
" you had better not accept , governor , " said some friends to <name> <name> .
" there may be trouble . "
" i am not afraid , " answered the former leader of the rough riders .
" but mr. <name> and yourself are to be there at practically the same time . "
" that does not matter , " said the governor .
and he went to chicago on <name> 3 , to attend the labor day celebrations .
the picnic was held at electric park , and in the presence of fifteen thousand people governor <name> and mr. <name> " buried the hatchet " for the time being , and spoke to those surrounding them on the dignity of labor and the duties of the laboring man to better himself and his social conditions .
in that motley collection of people there were frequent cries of " hurrah for <name> ! "
and " what 's the matter with <name> ?
he 's all right ! "
but there was no disturbance , and each speaker was listened to with respectful attention from start to finish .
it was without a doubt a meeting to show true american <name> and free speech at its best .
but all of the stops on his tours were not so pleasant to governor <name> .
in every community there are those who are <unk> and bound to make an exhibition of their baseness .
at <unk> , new york , a stone was flung at him through the car window , breaking the glass but missing the candidate for whom it was intended .
at once there was excitement .
" are you hurt , governor ? "
was the question asked .
" no , " returned <name> <name> .
and then he added , with a faint smile , " it 's only a bouquet , but i wish , after this , they would n't make them quite so hard . "
there was also a demonstration against the candidate at <unk> , new york , which threatened for a while to break up an intended meeting .
but the worst <unk> was encountered at <name> , a small town in colorado , near the well-known mining centre of cripple creek .
<name> was full of miners who wanted not " sound money , " but " free silver , " for free silver , so styled , meant a great booming of silver mining .
" we do n't want him here , " said these miners .
" we have heard enough about him and his gold standard .
he had better keep away , or he 'll regret it . "
when <name> <name> was told he might have trouble in the mining camps , he merely shrugged his shoulders .
" i know these men , " he said .
" the most of them are as honest and respectable as the citizens of new york .
i am not afraid of the vicious element .
the better class are bound to see fair play . "
the governor spoke at a place called <unk> hall , and the <unk> was packed .
he had just begun his speech when there was a wild yelling and <unk> , all calculated to drown him out .
he waited for a minute , and then , as the noise subsided , tried to go on once more , when a voice cried out :  " what about rotten beef ? "
referring to the beef furnished during the <name> campaign , which had , of course , come through a republican <unk> department .
" i ate that beef , " answered the governor , quickly .
and then he added to the fellow who had thus questioned him : " you <name> never get near enough to be hit with a bullet , or within five miles of it . "
at this many burst into applause , and the man , who was a coward at heart , sneaked from the hall in a hurry .
he was no soldier and had never suffered the hardships of any campaign , and many hooted him as he deserved .
but the trouble was not yet over .
<name> <name> finished his address , and then started to leave the hall in company with a number of his friends .
on the way to the train a crowd of rowdies followed the candidate 's party , and threw all sorts of things at them .
one man made a personal attack on the governor and hit him on the chest with a stick .
he tried to leap away , but was knocked down by a personal friend of <name> <name> .
" down with the gold bugs ! "
was the cry , and the violence of the mob increased .
the friends of governor <name> rallied to his support , and blows were given and taken freely .
but with it all the candidate reached his train in safety , and in a few minutes more had left the town far behind .
he was not much disturbed , and the very next day went on with his <unk> as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened .
the better classes of citizens of <name> were much disturbed over the happening , and they sent many regrets to governor <name> , assuring him that such a demonstration would never again be permitted to occur .
chapter xxii elected vice-president of the united states  <unk> over the senate  tax upon <name> <name> 's strength  start on another grand hunting tour but the campaign , sharp and bitter as it had been , was not yet at an end .
in new york city there followed a " sound money parade , " which was perhaps the largest of its kind ever witnessed in the united states .
it was composed of all sorts and conditions of men , from bankers and brokers of wall street to the humble factory and mill hands from up the river and beyond .
the parade took several hours to pass , and was witnessed by crowds almost as great as had witnessed the <name> demonstration .
in new york city , as the time <name> closer for the election , there was every intimation that the contest would be an unusually " hot " one , and that there would be much <unk> and corruption .
it was said by some that police methods were very lax at that time , and that the saloons , which ought to be closed on election day , would be almost if not quite wide open .
[ illustration : photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> president <name> and vice-president <name> . ]
" we must have an honest election , " said governor <name> .
and without loss of time he sent letters to mayor van <unk> , and to the sheriff and the district attorney of the county of new york , calling their attention to the facts in the case , and telling them that he would hold them strictly responsible if they did not do their full duty .
as a consequence the election was far more orderly than it might otherwise have been in the metropolitan district .
the results of the long contest were speedily known .
<name> and <name> had been elected by a large plurality , and both they and their numerous friends and supporters were correspondingly happy .
great parades were had in their honor , and it was predicted , and rightly , that the prosperity which our country had enjoyed for several years in the past would continue for many years to come .
during those days the united states had but one outside difficulty , which was in <name> .
there a certain set of people called the <unk> arose in rebellion and threatened the lives of all foreigners , including american citizens .
an international army was organized , including american , english , french , <name> , japanese , and other troops , and a quick attack was made upon <unk> and pekin , and the suffering foreigners in <name> were rescued .
in this campaign the american soldiers did their full share of the work and added fresh laurels to the name of old <name> .
the tax upon the strength of the newly elected vice-president had been very great , and he was glad to surrender the duties of governor into the hands of his successor .
but as vice-president , <name> <name> became the presiding officer of the united states senate , a position of equal if not greater importance .
as president of the senate it is said that mr. <name> was kind yet firm , and ever on the alert to see that affairs ran smoothly .
he occupied the position only for one short <name> session , and during that time nothing came under discussion that was of prime importance , although my young readers must remember that all the work accomplished in our senate is of more or less magnitude .
" he was very <name> in his work , " says one who was in the senate at that time .
" as was his usual habit , he took little for granted , but usually started to investigate for himself .
he knew the rules thoroughly , and rarely made an error . "
for a long time the newly elected vice-president had been wanting to get back to his favorite recreation , hunting .
despite the excitement of political life , he could not overcome his fondness for his rifle and the wilderness .
he felt that an outing would do his system much good , and accordingly arranged for a five weeks ' hunting trip in northwestern colorado .
in this trip , which he has himself described in one of his admirable hunting papers , he had with him two companions , dr. <name> webb of colorado springs , and mr. <name> k. <name> , an old friend who in former years had been captain of the yale <unk> team .
the party went as far as the railroad would <name> them , and then started for a settlement called meeker , forty miles distant .
the weather was extremely cold , with the thermometer from ten to twenty degrees below zero , but the journey to meeker was made in safety , and here the hunters met their guide , a well-known <name> of that region named <unk> , and started with him for his ranch , several miles away .
<name> <name> would have liked to bring down a bear on this trip , but the <unk> were all in <name> quarters and sleeping soundly , so the hunt was confined to <unk> and <unk> .
the hunting began early , for on the way to the ranch the hounds <unk> a <unk> , commonly known as a lynx , which was secured without much trouble , and a second <unk> was secured the next day .
the territory surrounding <unk> 's ranch , called the <unk> , was an ideal one for hunting , with clumps of cottonwoods and pines scattered here and there , and numerous cliffs and ravines , the hiding-places of game <unk> .
the ranch home stood at the foot of several <unk> hills , a long , low , <unk> affair , built of rough logs , but clean and comfortable within .
the two days ' ride in the <unk> air had been a severe test of endurance , and all were glad , when the ranch was reached , to " thaw out " before the roaring fire , and sit down to the hot and hearty meal that had been prepared in anticipation of their coming .
the hunters had some excellent hounds , trained especially for <unk> and <unk> , animals that were never allowed to go after small game under any circumstances .
<name> <name> was much taken with them from the start , and soon got to know each by name .
" in cougar hunting the success of the <name> depends absolutely upon his hounds , " says mr. <name> .
and he described each hound with great minuteness , showing that he allowed little to escape his trained eye while on this tour .
on the day after the arrival at the ranch the party went out for its first cougar , which , as my young readers perhaps know , is an animal inhabiting certain wild parts of our west and southwest .
the beast grows to a size of from six to nine feet in length , and weighs several hundred pounds .
it is variously known as a puma and panther , the latter name sometimes being changed to " painter . "
when attacked , it is <unk> exceedingly savage , and on certain occasions has been known to kill a man .
in colorado the cougar is hunted almost exclusively with the aid of hounds , and this was the method adopted on the present occasion .
with the pen of a true sportsman , mr. <name> tells us how the hounds were held back until a cougar trail less than thirty-six hours old was struck .
then off went the pack along the cliffs and ravines , with the hunters following on horseback .
the trail led up the mountain side and then across the valley opposite , and soon the hounds were out of sight .
leading their steeds , the hunters went down the valley and followed the dogs , to find they had separated among the bare spots beyond .
but soon came a welcome sound .
" the cougar 's <unk> , " announced the guide .
and so it proved .
but when the hunters came closer , the cougar , an old female , leaped from the tree , <unk> the dogs , and leaped into another tree .
then , as the party again came up , the beast took another leap and started to run once more .
but now the hounds were too quick , and in a trice they had the cougar surrounded .
slipping in , <name> <name> ended the struggles of the wild beast by a <unk> behind the shoulder .
the next day there was another hunt , and this had rather a tinge of sadness to it .
the dogs tracked a mother cougar , who occupied her den with her three kittens .
the hounds rushed into the hole , barking furiously , and presently one came out with a dead kitten in his mouth .
" i had supposed a cougar would defend her young to the last , " says mr. <name> , " but such was not the case in this instance .
for some minutes she kept the dogs at bay , but gradually gave ground , leaving her three kittens . "
the dogs killed the kittens without loss of time , and then followed the cougar as she fled from the other end of her hole .
but the hounds were too quick for her , and soon had her on the ground .
<name> <name> rushed up , knife in one hand and rifle in the other .
with the firearm he struck the beast in the jaws , and then ended the struggle by a <unk> straight into the heart .
to many this may seem a cruel sport , and in a certain sense it assuredly is ; but my young readers must remember that <unk> and other wild beasts are a menace to civilization in the far west , and they have been shot down and killed at every available opportunity .
more than this , as i have already mentioned , <name> <name> is more than a mere <name> <unk> in bloodshed .
he is a naturalist , and examines with care everything brought down and reports upon it , so that his hunting trips have added not a little to up-to-date natural history .
the skulls of the various animals killed on this trip were forwarded to the <unk> survey , department of agriculture , washington , and in return mr. <name> received a letter , part of which stated :  " your series of skulls from colorado is incomparably the largest , most complete , and most valuable series ever brought together from any single locality , and <name> be of inestimable value in determining the amount of individual variation . "
chapter xxiii the <name> family in the adirondacks  the pan-american exposition at buffalo  shooting of president <name>  the <unk> visit  death of the president <name> <name> 's companions of the hunt remained with him for fourteen days , after which they departed , leaving him with <unk> , the ranchman and <name> already mentioned .
when the pair were alone , they visited <unk> mountain , said to be a great ground for <unk> and <unk> , and there hunted with great success .
all together the trip of five weeks ' hunting <unk> fourteen <unk> , the largest of which was eight feet in length and weighed 227 pounds .
mr. <name> also brought down five <unk> , showing that he was just as skilful with his rifle as ever .
the hero of san <name> hill fairly loved the outdoor exercise of the hunt , and spent three weeks in keen enjoyment after his companions had departed .
during this time it snowed heavily , so that the hunters were often compelled to remain indoors .
as luck would have it there were other ranches in that vicinity , with owners that were hospitable , so that they did not have to go into camp , as would otherwise have been the case .
on the last day of the hunt , <name> <name> was able to bring down the largest cougar yet encountered .
the hounds were on the trail of one beast when they came across that of another and took it up with but little warning .
" we 're going to get a big one now , " said <unk> .
" just you wait and see . "
" well , if we do , it <name> be a good ending to my outing , " responded <name> <name> .
the cougar was at last located by the hounds in a large <unk> on the side of a hill .
it had run a long distance and was evidently out of breath , but as the hunters <name> closer , it leaped to the ground and trotted away through the snow .
away went the hounds on the new trail of the beast .
" he 's game , and he 'll get away if he can , " said the guide .
at the top of another hill the cougar halted and one of the hounds leaped in , and was immediately sent sprawling by a savage blow of the wild animal 's paw .
then on went the cougar as before , the hounds barking wildly as they went in pursuit .
when <name> <name> came up once more , the cougar was in another <unk> tree , with the hounds in a semicircle on the ground below .
" now i think i 've got him , " whispered <name> <name> to his companion , and advanced on foot , with great <unk> .
at first he could see nothing , but at last made out the back and tail of the great beast , as it lay crouched among the branches .
with great care he took aim and fired , and the cougar fell to the ground , shot through the back .
at once the hounds rushed in and seized the game .
but the cougar was not yet dead , and snapping and snarling the beast slipped over the ground and down a hillside , with the dogs all around it .
<name> <name> came up behind , working his way through the brush with all speed .
then , watching his chance , he jumped in , hunting-knife in hand , and despatched the game .
" a good haul , " cried <unk> .
and later on he and his men came to the conclusion that it was the same cougar that had carried off a cow and a steer and killed a work horse belonging to one of the ranches near by .
the five weeks spent in the far west strengthened <name> <name> a great deal , and it was with renewed energy that he took up his duties as vice-president of our nation .
in the meantime , however , matters were not going on so well at home .
among the children two had been very sick , and in the summer it was suggested that some pure mountain air would do them a great deal of good .
" very well , we 'll go to the mountains , " said mr. <name> , and looked around to learn what place would be best to choose .
among the <unk> mountains of new york state there is a reservation of ninety-six thousand acres leased by what is called the <unk> club , a wealthy organization of people who have numerous summer cottages built within the preserve .
among the members was a mr. <unk> , an old friend of the <name> family , and he suggested that they occupy his cottage until the close of the season .
this invitation was accepted , and the whole <name> family moved up to the spot , which was located at the foot of mount <name> , the largest of the mountains in that vicinity .
here mr. <name> spent much time in hunting and fishing , and also in writing .
the family were not forgotten , and he frequently went out with the whole party , rowing and exploring .
sometimes they took baskets of lunch with them and had regular picnics in the woods , something the <name> children enjoyed very much .
in the meantime the pan-american exposition at buffalo , new york , had been opened , and day after day it was thronged with visitors .
vice-president <name> had assisted at the opening , and he was one of many who hoped the exposition would be a great success .
at the exposition our government had a large exhibit , and it was thought highly proper that president <name> should visit the ground in his official capacity and deliver an address .
preparations were accordingly made , and the address was delivered on <name> 5 to a most enthusiastic throng .
[ 3 ] [ footnote 3 : for this speech in full , and for what happened after it was delivered , see " american boys ' life of <name> . " ]
on the following day the president was driven to the <name> of music , on the exposition grounds , there to hold a public reception .
the crowds were as great as ever , but perfectly orderly , and filed in at one side of the building and out at the other , each person in turn being permitted to grasp the chief magistrate 's hand .
for a while all went well , and nobody noticed anything unusual about a somewhat <unk> individual who joined the crowd , and who had one hand covered with a handkerchief .
as this rascal came up to shake hands , he raised the hand with the handkerchief and , using a concealed pistol , fired two shots at president <name> .
for an instant everybody was dazed .
then followed a commotion , and while some went to the wounded executive 's assistance , others leaped upon the dastardly assassin and made him a prisoner .
there was an excellent hospital upon the exposition grounds , and to this president <name> was carried .
here it was found that both bullets had entered his body , one having struck the <unk> and the other having entered the abdomen .
the physicians present did all they possibly could for him , and then he was removed to the residence of mr. <unk> , the president of the exposition .
in the meantime , all unconscious of the awful happening that was to have such an influence upon his future , mr. <name> had been enjoying himself with his family , and helping to take care of the children that were not yet totally recovered from their illness .
all seemed to be progressing finely , and he had gone off on a little tour to vermont , to visit some points of interest and deliver a few addresses .
he was at isle la <unk> , not far from burlington , when the news reached him that president <name> had been shot .
he had just finished an address , and for the moment he could not believe the sad news .
" shot ! "
he said .
" how dreadful ! "
and could scarcely say another word .
he asked for the latest bulletin , and , forgetful of all else , took the first train he could get to buffalo , and then hastened to the side of his chief .
it was truly a sad meeting .
for many years these two men had known each other , and they were warm friends .
their methods were somewhat different , but each stood for what was just and right and true , and each was ready to give his country his best service , no matter what the cost .
it was a sad time for the whole nation , and men and women watched the <unk> eagerly , hoping and praying that president <name> might recover .
every hour there was some slight change , and people would talk it over in a whisper .
in a few days there were hopeful signs , and the physicians , deceived by them , said they thought the president would recover .
this was glad news to <name> <name> .
yet he lingered on , fearful to go away , lest the news should prove untrue and he should be needed .
but then there was a still brighter turn , and he thought of his own family , and of the fact that one of his children was again ill. " i <name> return to my family , " said he to two of his closest friends .
" but if i am needed here , let me know at once . "
and his friends promised to keep him informed .
two days later he was back among the adirondacks , in the bosom of his family .
the prayers of a whole nation were in vain .
<name> <name> 's mission on earth was finished , and one week after he was shot he breathed his last .
his wife came to bid him farewell , and so did his other relatives , and his friend of many years , <name> <name> , and the members of his cabinet .
" it is god 's way , " murmured the dying executive .
" his <name> be done , not ours . "
then like a child going to sleep , he relapsed into unconsciousness , from which he did not recover .
he died <name> 14 , 1901 , at a little after two o'clock in the morning .
it was the last of a truly great life .
illustrious men may come and go , but <name> <name> <name> be remembered so long as our nation endures .
as a soldier and a statesman he gave his best talents to better the conditions of his fellow-creatures , and to place the united states where we justly belong , among the truly great nations of the world .
chapter xxiv <name> <name> 's tramp up mount <name>  a message of importance  wild midnight ride through the mountains  on the special trains from north creek to buffalo with a somewhat lighter heart , <name> <name> returned to the adirondacks and joined his family on wednesday , three days previous to president <name> 's death .
the last report he had received from buffalo was the most encouraging of any , and he now felt almost certain that the president would survive the outrageous attack that had been made upon his person .
" he <name> get well , " said several who lived close by .
" you need not worry about his condition any longer . "
on the following day it was planned to go up to <name> lake , five miles from where the family was stopping .
some friends went along , and in the party were mrs. <name> and several of the children .
two guides accompanied them , and it was decided to spend the night at a camp on the lake , returning home the following day .
the next morning it rained , but in spite of this drawback <name> <name> , leaving the ladies and children to return to the cottage , started to climb mount <name> .
such an undertaking was exactly to his liking , and he went up the rough and uneven trail with the vigor of a trained <unk> , the guide leading the way and the other gentlemen of the party following .
at last , high up on the side of mount <name> , the party reached a small body of water known as tear of the clouds , and here they rested for lunch .
" you are certainly a great <name> , mr. <name> , " remarked one of the gentlemen during the progress of the lunch .
" oh , i have to be , " answered <name> <name> , <unk> .
" a vice-president needs exercise to keep him alive .
you see , when he is in the senate , all of his work is done sitting down . "
the words had scarcely been uttered when one of the party pointed to a man climbing up the mountain side toward them .
the newcomer held some yellow <unk> in his hand , and <name> <name> quickly arose to receive them .
he had soon mastered the contents of the messages .
president <name> was much worse ; it was likely that he would not live .
for fully a minute mr. <name> did not speak .
he realized the great responsibility which rested upon his shoulders .
then , in a voice filled with emotion , he read the messages aloud .
" gentlemen , " he continued , " i must return to the <unk> at once . "
and without waiting , he turned and started down the mountain side along the trail by which he had come .
it was a long , hard walk , but it is doubtful if <name> <name> took note of it .
a thousand thoughts must have flashed through his mind .
if <name> <name> should indeed breathe his last , the nation would look to him as their chief magistrate .
he could not make himself believe that his president was to die .
it was not long before <name> <name> reached the <unk> at the lake .
he asked for further news , but none was forthcoming .
" we <name> send to the lower <unk> at once , " said his friends .
" you had better take a short rest , in case you have a sudden call to make the trip to buffalo . "
a <name> rain was falling , and the atmosphere of the mountains was raw and penetrating .
messengers were quickly despatched to the lower <unk> , and by eleven o'clock that evening news came back that left no doubt of the true condition of affairs .
president <name> was sinking rapidly , and his death was now only a question of a few hours .
" i must go , and at once , " said <name> <name> .
and soon a light wagon drove up to the <unk> , and he leaped in .
there was a short good-by to his family and his friends , the whip cracked , and the drive of thirty-five miles to the nearest railroad station was begun .
it was a never-to-be-forgotten journey .
for ten miles or more the road was fearfully rough and ran around the edges of overhanging cliffs , where a false turn might mean death .
then at times the road went down into deep hollows and over <name> hills .
all was pitch black , save for the <name> yellow light hanging over the <unk> of the turnout .
crouched on the seat , mr. <name> urged the driver to go on , and go on they did , making better time during that rain and darkness than had before been made in broad daylight .
at last a place called <name> 's was reached , and <name> <name> alighted .
" what news have you for me ? "
he asked of a waiting messenger , and the latest message was handed to him .
there was no new <name> ,  president <name> was sinking faster than ever .
new horses were obtained , and the second part of the journey , from <name> 's to <unk> lair , was begun .
and during that wild , swift ride of nine miles , when it seemed to <name> <name> as if he were racing against death , the <name> of life everlasting claimed <name> <name> , and the man crouched in the wagon , wet from the rain , hurrying to reach him , became the next president of the united states .
it was a little after three in the morning when <unk> lair was reached .
the sufferer at buffalo had breathed his last , but <name> <name> did not know it , and he still hoped for the best .
more fresh horses , and now the last sixteen miles of the rough journey were made on a buckboard .
in spots the road was worse than it had previously been , and the driver was tempted to go slow .
" go on ! "
cried mr. <name> , and held his watch in hand .
" go on ! "
and the driver obeyed , the buckboard dancing up and down over the rocks and swinging dangerously from side to side around the curves of ravines .
but <name> <name> 's mind was not on the road nor on the peril of that ride , but in that room in buffalo where the great tragedy had just seen its completion .
at last , a little after five in the morning , the turnout came in sight of the railroad station at north creek .
a special train was in waiting for him .
he gazed anxiously at the little knot of people assembled .
their very faces told him the sorrowful truth .
president <name> was dead .
with bowed head he entered a private car of the special train , and without delay the train started on its journey southward for albany .
no time was lost on this portion of the trip , and at seven o'clock <name> <name> reached the city in which but a short time before he had presided as governor of the state .
at albany he was met by secretary of state hay , who informed him officially that president <name> was no more .
he likewise informed the vice-president that , considering the excitement , it might be best that mr. <name> be sworn in as president without delay .
another special train was in waiting at albany , and this was rushed westward with all possible speed , arriving in buffalo at half-past one in the afternoon .
in order to avoid the tremendous crowd at the union railroad station , mr. <name> alighted at the terrace station .
here he was met by several friends with a carriage and also a detachment of the fourth signal corps and a squad of mounted police .
without loss of time <name> <name> was driven to the <unk> house .
here he found a great many friends and relatives of the dead president assembled .
all were too shocked over what had occurred to say much , and shook the hand of the coming president in silence .
thousands of eyes were upon <name> <name> , but he noticed them not .
entering the <unk> house , he thought only of the one who had surrendered his life while doing his duty , and of that kind and patient woman now left to fight the battles of this world alone .
he offered what consolation he could to mrs. <name> , heard the little that had not yet been told of that final struggle to fight off death , and then took his departure , to assume the high office thus suddenly and unexpectedly thrust upon him .
chapter xxv takes the oath as president  the new chief magistrate at the funeral of president <name>  at the white house  how the first real working day was spent the new president took the oath of office at the residence of mr. <unk> <unk> in buffalo .
it is a fine , substantial mansion and has ever since been of historic interest to <unk> .
when he arrived at the <unk> home , he found a number of members of the <name> cabinet awaiting him , as well as judge <name> r. <name> , of the united states district court , who administered the oath ; and ten or a dozen others .
the scene was truly an affecting one .
secretary root could scarcely control himself , for , twenty years before , he had been at a similar scene , when vice-president <name> became chief magistrate , after the assassination of president <name> .
in a voice filled with emotion he requested vice-president <name> , on behalf of the cabinet as a whole , to take the prescribed oath .
it is recorded by an <unk> that <name> <name> was pale , and that his eyes were dim with tears , as he stepped forward to do as bidden .
his hand was uplifted , and then in a solemn voice the judge began the oath :  " i do solemnly swear that i <name> faithfully execute the office of president of the united states , and <name> , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states . "
the words were repeated in a low but distinct voice by <name> <name> , and a moment of utter silence followed .
" mr. president , please attach your signature , " went on the judge .
and in a firm hand the new chief executive wrote " <name> <name> " at the bottom of the all-important document which made him the president of our beloved country .
standing in that room , the president felt the great responsibility which now rested on his shoulders , and turning to those before him , he spoke as follows :  " in this hour of deep and terrible bereavement , i wish to state that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of president <name> for the peace and prosperity and honor of our country . "
these were no mere words , as his actions immediately afterward prove .
on reaching washington he assembled the cabinet at the home of commander <unk> , his brother-in-law , and there spoke to them somewhat in this strain :  " i wish to make it clear to you , gentlemen , that what i said at buffalo i meant .
i want each of you to remain as a member of my cabinet .
i need your advice and counsel .
i tender you the office in the same manner that i would tender it if i were entering upon the discharge of my duties as the result of an election by the people . "
having thus declared himself , the newly made president asked each member personally to stay with him .
it was a sincere request , and the cabinet members all agreed to remain by mr. <name> and aid him exactly as they had been aiding mr. <name> .
thus was it shown to the world at large , and especially to the <unk> , of which the assassin of <name> had been one , that though the president might be slain , the government still lived .
the entire country was prostrate over the sudden death of president <name> , and one of the first acts of <name> <name> , after assuming the responsibilities of his office , was to issue the following proclamation :  " a terrible bereavement has befallen our people .
the president of the united states has been struck down ; a crime committed not only against the chief magistrate , but against every <unk> and <unk> citizen .
" president <name> crowned a life of largest love for his fellow-men , of most <name> endeavor for their welfare , by a death of <name> fortitude ; and both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which , in the supreme hour of trial , he met his death , <name> remain forever a precious heritage of our people .
" it is meet that we , as a nation , express our abiding love and reverence for his life , our deep sorrow for his untimely death .
" now , therefore , i , <name> <name> , president of the united states , do appoint thursday next , <name> 19 , the day in which the body of the dead president <name> be laid in its last earthly resting-place , a day of mourning and prayer throughout the united states .
" i earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship , there to bow down in submission to the <name> of almighty god , and to pay out of full hearts their homage of love and reverence to the great and good president whose death has smitten the nation with bitter grief . "
the funeral of president <name> was a most imposing one .
the body was at first laid in state in the city hall at buffalo , where president <name> and fully a hundred and fifty thousand men , women , and children went to view the remains .
from buffalo the remains were taken by special funeral train to washington , and there placed in the rotunda of the capitol .
here the crowd was equally great , and here the services were attended by representatives from almost every civilized nation on the globe .
outside a <name> band was stationed , playing the dead president 's favorite hymns , " lead , kindly light " and " nearer , my god , to thee , " and in the singing of these thousands of mourners joined , while the tears of sorrow streamed down their faces .
from washington the body of the <unk> president was taken to canton , ohio , where had been his private home .
here his friends and neighbors assembled to do him final honor , and great arches of green branches and flowers were erected , under which the funeral <unk> passed .
as the body was placed in the receiving vault , business throughout the entire united states was suspended .
in spirit , eighty millions of people were surrounding the mortal <name> left by the passing of a soul to the place whence it had come .
it was truly a funeral of which the greatest of kings might well be proud .
the <unk> of president <name> undoubtedly had a great effect upon president <name> .
during the presidential campaign the <unk> <unk> had made many speeches in behalf of his fellow candidate , showing the high personal character of <name> , and what might be expected from the man in case he was elected once more to the office of chief magistrate .
more than this , when assistant secretary of the navy , mr. <name> had done his best to <name> out the plans <unk> by the president .
the two were close friends , and in the one brief session of the senate when he was vice-president , mr. <name> gave to president <name> many evidences of his high regard .
on returning to washington , president <name> did not at once take up his residence at the white house , preferring that the place should be left to mrs. <name> until she had sufficiently recovered from her terrible shock to arrange for the removal of the family 's personal effects .
as it may interest some of my young readers to know how president <name> 's first day as an active president was spent , i append the following , taken down at the time by a reporter for a press association :  " reached the white house from canton , on <name> 20 , 1901 , at <unk> <unk> .
went at once to the private office formerly occupied by president <name> , and , as speedily as possible , settled down for the business of the day .
" met secretary long of the navy in the cabinet room and held a discussion concerning naval matters ; received colonel <unk> to talk over some army appointments ; signed appointments of general j. m. <name> and others ; met senators <unk> and <unk> .
" at 11 a.m. called for the first time formal meeting of the cabinet and transacted business of that body until <unk> p.m. " received his old friend , general wood , and held conference with him and with secretary root in regard to cuban election laws .
" president <name> left the white house at <unk> p.m. to take lunch with secretary hay at the latter 's residence .
he was alone , disregarding the services of a body-guard .
" returned to the white house at <unk> p.m. and transacted business with some officials and received a few personal friends .
" engaged with secretary <unk> from 4 p.m. to <unk> p.m. in the transaction of public business , disposal of mail , etc .
" left the white house unattended at <unk> p.m. and walked through the <unk> streets of washington to <unk> n street , <unk> , the residence of his brother-in-law , commander <unk> .
dined in private with the family .
" late in the evening received a few close friends .
retired at 11 p.m. " it <name> be observed that special mention is made of the fact that president <name> travelled around alone .
immediately after the terrible tragedy at buffalo many citizens were of the opinion that the chief magistrate of our nation ought to be strongly protected , for fear of further violence , but to this <name> <name> would not listen .
" i am not afraid , " he said calmly .
" we are living in a peaceful country , and the great mass of our people are orderly , <unk> citizens .
i can trust them , and take care of myself . "
and to this he held , despite the protestations of his closest friends .
of course he is scarcely ever without some guard or secret service detective close at hand , but no outward display of such protection is permitted .
and let it be added to the credit of our people that , though a few <unk> and crazy persons have caused him a little annoyance , he has never , up to the present time , been molested in any way .
chapter xxvi continuing the work begun by president <name>  the panama canal agitation  visit of <name> <name> of prussia  the president at the charleston exposition president <name> had said he would continue the policy inaugurated by president <name> , and one of the important steps in this direction was to appoint many to office who had been expecting appointment at the hands of the <unk> president .
this gained him many friends , and soon some who had kept themselves at a distance flocked around , to aid him in every possible manner .
late in <name> the last of the <name> effects were taken from the white house , and some days later the newly made president moved in , with his family , who had come down from the adirondacks some time previous .
in washington the family were joined by mr. <name> 's two <unk> , commander <name> .
<unk> <unk> and mr. <name> robinson , and their wives , and the relatives remained together for some days .
it was at first feared by some politicians that president <name> would be what is termed a " <unk> president , "  that is , that he would favor one section of our country to the exclusion of the others , but he soon proved that he was altogether too <name> for such baseness .
" i am going to be president of the whole united states , " he said .
" i do n't care for sections or <unk> lines .
i was born in the north , but my mother was from the south , and i have spent much of my time in the west , so i think i can fairly represent the whole country . "
president <name> sympathized deeply with the condition of the negroes in the south , and for the purpose of learning the true state of affairs sent for mr. <name> t. washington , one of the foremost colored men of this country and founder of the <unk> industrial school for colored people .
they had a long conference at the white house , which mr. washington enjoyed very much .
for this action many criticised the president severely , but to this he paid no attention , satisfied that he had done his duty as his conscience dictated .
[ illustration : president <name> at his desk . ]
president <name> 's first message to congress was awaited with considerable interest .
it was remembered that he was the youngest executive our white house had ever known , and many were curious to know what he would say and what he proposed to do .
the <unk> congress of the united states assembled at washington , december 2 , 1901 , and on the day following , president <name> 's first annual message was read in both senate and house of representatives .
it proved to be a surprisingly long and strong state paper , and by many was considered one of the best messages sent to congress in many years .
it touched upon general conditions in our country , spoke for improvements in the army and the navy , called for closer attention to civil service reform , for a correction of the faults in the post-office system , and for a clean administration in the philippines , hawaii , and porto <name> .
it spoke of several great needs of the government , and added that the gold standard act had been found timely and judicious .
" president <name> is all right , " was the general comment , after the message had been printed in the various papers of our country .
" he is looking ahead , and he knows exactly what this country wants and needs .
we are prosperous now , and if we want to continue so , we must keep our hands on the plough , and not look backward . "
the first break in the old cabinet occurred on december 17 , when postmaster general <name> e. smith resigned .
his place was immediately filled by the appointment of <name> c. <unk> , of wisconsin .
soon after this secretary <unk> of the treasury resigned , and his place was filled by former governor <name> m. shaw , of iowa .
for a long time there had been before the american people various suggestions to build a canal across central <name> , to join the atlantic and the pacific oceans , so that the ships wanting to go from one body of water to the other would not have to take the long and expensive trip around cape horn .
in years gone by the french had also contemplated such a canal , and had even gone to work at the isthmus of panama , making an elaborate survey and doing not a little digging .
but the work was beyond them , and the french canal company soon ran out of funds and went into the hands of a receiver .
" we ought to take hold and dig a canal , " was heard on all sides in the united states .
but where to dig the canal was a question .
some said the isthmus of panama was the best place , while others preferred a route through nicaragua .
the discussion waxed very warm , and at last a commission was appointed to go over both routes and find out which would be the more satisfactory from every point of view .
the commission was not very long in reaching a decision .
the panama canal company was willing to sell out all its interest in the work already done for forty millions of dollars , and it was recommended that the united states accept this offer .
president <name> received the report , and lost no time in submitting it to congress .
at the beginning of the new year , 1902 , there was a grand ball at the white house , attended by a large gathering of people , including many of the foreign representatives <unk> to washington .
the occasion was the introduction into society of miss <name> <name> , and the affair was a most pleasing one from beginning to end .
one of the president 's sons , <name> <name> , jr. , had been sent to a boarding school at <unk> , massachusetts .
early in february he was taken down with a cold that developed into pneumonia .
it looked as if the youth might die , and both mrs. <name> and the president lost no time in leaving washington and going to his bedside .
the sympathy of the whole country was with the anxious parents , and when it was announced that the crisis had been passed in safety there was much relief in all quarters .
before this illness occurred there came to the <unk> an invitation which pleased them , and especially miss <name> , not a little .
the <name> emperor <name> was having a yacht built in this country , at <unk> island .
he sent his brother , <name> <name> of prussia , over to attend the launching , and requested miss <name> to <name> the yacht , which was to be called the meteor .
the arrival of <name> <name> was made a <name> day by many who wished to see the friendship between the united states and germany more firmly cemented than ever , and the <name> visitor was treated with every consideration wherever he went .
from new york he journeyed to washington , where he dined with the president .
he returned to new york with president <name> and with miss <name> , and on february 25 the launching occurred , in the presence of thousands of people and a great many craft of all sorts .
miss <name> performed the christening in appropriate style , and this was followed by music from a band and the blowing of hundreds of steam whistles .
after these ceremonies were over , there followed an elaborate dinner given by the mayor of new york , and then the <name> started on a tour of the country lasting two weeks .
his visit made a good impression wherever he went , and he was universally put down as a right good fellow .
it was about this time that president <name> showed he was not to be led altogether by what his party did .
so far he had not <unk> any measures sent to him for his signature .
now , however , a <name> came to him touching the desertion of a sailor in the navy .
congress was willing to strike the black record of the sailor from the books , but president <name> would not have it .
" the sailor did wrong , " he said .
" he knew what he was doing , too .
the record against him must stand . "
and he <unk> the <name> .
on the other hand he was prompt to recognize real worth in those who had served the government , and when over two hundred private pension bills came before him for his approval , he signed them without a murmur .
the people of charleston , south <name> , had been arranging for a long time to hold an exposition which should set forth the real advance and worth of the leading southern industries .
this exposition was now open to the public , and president <name> and his wife were invited to attend the exhibit .
with so much southern blood in his veins , the president could not think of refusing , and he and mrs. <name> visited the exposition early in <name> .
it was a <name> day at charleston , and the president and mrs. <name> were received with every honor due their rank , and with great personal consideration .
governor <unk> of the state was assisted by governor <unk> , of north <name> , in receiving president <name> .
a stirring patriotic speech was made by the president during his visit , and a feature of the trip was the presentation of a sword to <name> <name> jenkins of the rough riders .
a great number of president <unk> former troopers were present , and all were glad , as of old , to crowd around and take him by the hand .
chapter xxvii destruction of st. <name>  american aid  the great coal strike  president <name> ends the difficulty  tour through new england  the trolley accident in the <unk>  a providential escape from death during the summer of 1902 two matters of great importance occurred in which the whole people of our nation were deeply interested .
early in may occurred tremendous volcanic eruptions on the islands of <unk> and st. <name> .
at the former island , mont <unk> threw such a rain of fire upon the town of st. <name> that the entire place , with about thirty thousand people , was wiped out of existence in a minute .
at other points the eruptions were not so bad , yet hundreds lost their lives , and all of the islands of the lesser <unk> were thrown into a state bordering upon panic .
it was felt that something must be done , and at once , for the sufferers , and a large fund for relief was gathered , of which the americans contributed their full share .
the volcanic disturbances continued for some time , and as it was thought they might also cover certain portions of central <name> , nothing was done further concerning a canal to unite the two oceans .
the other event of importance was the strike of thousands upon thousands of <unk> , working in pennsylvania and other states .
the miners did not think they were being treated rightly and went out in a body , and for many weeks not a pound of coal of any kind was <unk> .
this produced a double hardship , for people could get no coal either for the fall or <name> , and the miners were , in some cases , reduced almost to the verge of starvation .
neither the workmen nor the <unk> of the mines would give in , and soon there was more or less violence , and some soldiers had to be called out in an effort to preserve order .
as matters went from bad to worse , and it looked as if the entire eastern section of our country would have to go without coal for the <name> , there were loud demands that the government take hold of the difficulty and settle the matter , if not in one way , then in another .
at last , early in october , the whole country was aroused , for it was felt that with no coal a <name> of untold suffering stared the people in the face .
president <name> held a conference at washington with the mine <unk> and the representatives of the miners .
" we must get together , gentlemen , " said he .
" the country can not do without coal , and you must supply it to us . "
and he laid down the law in a manner not to be misunderstood .
another conference followed , and then a third , and at last the coal <unk> asked the president to appoint a commission to decide upon the points in dispute .
to this the representative of the mine workers agreed , and as a result a commission was appointed by president <name> , which was to settle all points in dispute , and by its decision each side was to abide .
in the meantime , while the commission was at work , the mine workers were to resume their labors .
the mines were thereupon once more put in operation , after a strike lasting over five months .
this is the greatest coal strike known in american history , and it is not likely that the people at large <name> ever again permit themselves to suffer for the want of coal as they did during that fall and the <name> which followed .
early in <name> occurred the centennial celebration of the founding of the united states military academy at west point .
the occasion was made one of great interest , and among the many distinguished visitors were president <name> and general miles , head of our army at that time .
the president reviewed the cadets and made a speech to them , <unk> them on their truly excellent showing as soldiers .
although very busy with matters of state , president <name> received an urgent call to deliver a fourth of july oration at pittsburg .
he consented , and spoke to a vast assemblage on the rights and duties of american citizens .
to remain in washington during the hot summer months was out of the question with president <name> and his family , and early in the season he removed to oyster bay , there to enjoy himself as best he might during the short time allowed him for recreation .
that the business of the administration might not be too seriously interrupted , he hired a few rooms over a bank building in the village of oyster bay , and these were fitted up for himself and his several secretaries and assistants .
to the bank building he rode or drove every day , spending an hour or more over the routine work required .
by this means undesirable visitors were kept away from his private residence , and he was permitted to enjoy himself as he pleased in company with his family .
while mr. <name> was <unk> at oyster bay , it was arranged that he should make a short tour through new england , to last from <name> 22 to <name> 3 .
the trip covered every new england state , and was one of great pleasure to the president until the last day .
everywhere he went he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds , and , of course , had to make one of his characteristic speeches , accompanied by a great deal of <unk> .
on the last day of the trip he was at <name> , massachusetts , the home of governor crane .
it had been planned to drive from <name> to <unk> , a beautiful spot , adjoining <name> lake , where are located the summer homes of many american <unk> .
the trip was begun without a thought of what was to follow .
in the party , besides president <name> , were governor crane , secretary <unk> ( afterward made a member of the cabinet ) , united states secret service officer <name> <name> , and the driver of the carriage .
it may be mentioned here that <name> <name> was detailed as a special guard for the president , and had been with him since the tour was begun .
there are a number of trolley lines in this section of massachusetts , all <unk> in <unk> .
as the mass of the people were very anxious to see president <name> , the <unk> going to the points where he would pass were crowded , and the cars were run with more than usual speed .
as the carriage containing the president and his companions attempted to cross the trolley tracks a car came bounding along at a rapid rate of speed .
there seemed to be no time in which to stop the car , and in an instant the long and heavy affair crashed into the carriage with all force , hurling the occupants to the street in all directions .
the secret service officer , <name> <name> , was instantly killed , and the driver of the carriage was seriously hurt .
there was immediate and great excitement , and for the time being it was feared that president <name> had been seriously injured .
he had been struck a sharp blow on the leg , and had fallen on his face , cutting it not a little .
the shock was a severe one , but in a little while he was himself once more , although his face was much swollen .
later still a small <unk> formed on the injured limb , but this was skilfully treated by his physician , and soon disappeared .
the others in the carriage escaped with but a few bruises and a general <unk> .
the result of this accident , small as it was to the president personally , showed well how firmly he was seated in the affection of his fellow-citizens .
from all over the country , as well as from his friends in foreign climes , telegrams of <unk> came pouring in .
everybody was glad that he had escaped , and everybody wished to show how he felt over the affair .
" president <name> was much affected by the messages received , " said one who was in a position to know .
" it showed him that his friends were in every walk of life , from the highest to the lowest .
had he met death , as did the secret service officer detailed to guard over him , the shock to the people , coming so soon after the assassination of president <name> , would have been tremendous . "
the president had already been persuaded to consent to a short trip to the south , from <name> 5 to 10 , and then a trip to the west , lasting until <name> 19 , or longer .
the trips came to an end on <name> 23 , in indiana , because of the <unk> on the lower limb already mentioned , yet on november 19 he was given a grand reception by the people of memphis , tennessee , who flocked around him and were glad to see him as well as ever .
" we are so glad you escaped from that trolley accident ! "
was heard a hundred times .
" we ca n't afford to lose you , mr. president , " said others .
" really good men are too scarce . "
and then a cheer would go up for " the hero of san <name> hill ! "
his speeches on these trips were largely about the trusts and <unk> that are trying to control various industries of our country .
it is an intricate subject , yet it can be said that mr. <name> understands it as well as any one , and is laboring hard to do what is right and best , both for the <unk> and the capitalist .
congress had , some time before , voted a large sum for the extension and improvement of the white house , and while mr. <name> and his family were at oyster bay these improvements were begun .
they continued during the fall , and the president made his temporary home at a private residence in the capital city .
here it was he was treated for his wounded limb , and here he ended the coal strike , as already <unk> .
chapter xxviii new offices at the white house  sends a wireless message to king <name> of england  end of the trouble in <unk>  the canadian boundary dispute  beginning of a trip to the west  in yellowstone park the end of the year found president <name> in the best of health , despite the accident some weeks previous .
the improvements at the white house were now complete , and the family of the chief magistrate took possession .
a separate set of offices for the president and his cabinet had been built at the western end of the executive mansion , and the rooms formerly used for this purpose were turned into living apartments .
the changes made have been approved by many who have seen them , and they have wondered why the alterations were not made a long time ago .
on december 1 , congress assembled for a new session , and on the day following the president 's message was read .
it was a masterly state paper , dealing with the trust question , our relations with the new government of cuba ( for the island was now free , just as we had meant it to be when the war with spain started ) , the creation of a new department of commerce and labor , needs of the army and navy , and the all-important matter of how the philippines should be governed .
it may be added here that not long after this a department of commerce and labor was created by congress , and mr. <name> b. <unk> , the secretary to the president , became its first official head .
when mr. <unk> left his post as secretary , mr. <name> <unk> , jr. , who had been the <unk> private secretary for some time , became the regular first secretary to the chief magistrate , a place he occupies to-day .
just about this time there was considerable trouble in <unk> , mississippi .
a colored young <name> had been appointed <unk> , and the people in that vicinity refused to recognize her .
the post-office department did what it could in the matter , and then referred the case to the president .
[ illustration : the white house , showing new offices . ]
" as she has been regularly appointed , the people <name> have to accept her , " said mr. <name> .
and when there was more trouble , he sent forward an order that the post-office be shut up entirely .
this was done , and for a long time the people of that vicinity had to get their mail elsewhere , a great inconvenience to them .
on <name> 1 , 1903 , the new cable to the hawaiian islands was completed , and president <name> received a message from governor dole , and sent a reply to the same .
about two weeks later the president sent a wireless , or rather <unk> , message to king <name> of england .
this helped to <name> the beginning of a new <name> in <unk> which may cause great changes in the transmission of messages in the future .
for some time past there had been a <unk> war going on in <unk> , south <name> , between that nation on one hand and england , germany , and italy on the other .
this war had caused much disturbance to american trade .
pressure was brought to bear upon the several nations through president <name> , and at last it was agreed to leave matters to be settled by <unk> at the hague .
the agreements to this end were signed at washington , much to the president 's satisfaction .
all trouble then ceased , and american commerce was resumed as before .
for many years there had been a dispute between the united states and canada , regarding a certain boundary line .
this country claimed a long strip of territory next to the sea , near the <unk> of dyea and <unk> , and canada claimed that this strip , about thirty miles in width , belonged to her domain .
there had been endless disputes about the claim , and considerable local trouble , especially during the rush to the klondike after gold .
many americans contended that we had absolute right to the territory , and when <unk> was spoken of , said we had nothing to <unk> .
this was , in the main , president <name> 's view of the matter , yet , as things grew more disturbed , he realized , as a good business man , that something must be done .
we did not wish to fight canada and england for the strip of land , and neither did they wish to fight , so at last a board of <unk> was agreed upon , and the claims of both parties were carefully investigated .
in the end nearly every point claimed by the united states was granted to us .
it was a great satisfaction to have this <unk> dispute settled ; and how much better it was to do it by <unk> than by going to war .
the regular session of congress came to an end on march 4 , 1903 , but president <name> had already called an extra session , to consider a <name> for <unk> in our dealing with the new government of cuba and to ratify a treaty with <unk> concerning the panama canal .
there was a great deal of debating at this session of congress .
the <name> concerning cuba caused but little trouble , but many wanted the canal placed in nicaragua instead of panama , and did not wish to pay the forty millions of dollars asked for the work already accomplished by the old french canal company .
but in the end the <name> passed the united states senate by a vote of seventy-three to five , with the <unk> that should we fail to make a satisfactory arrangement about the panama canal , then the government should build the canal through nicaragua .
president <name> was enthusiastic over a canal at the isthmus , and lost no time in arranging to push the work further .
the people of the far west were very anxious to meet the chief ruler of our nation , and early in the year it was arranged that president <name> should leave washington on <name> 1 for a tour to last until <name> .
in that time he was to visit more than twenty states , and make over one hundred stops .
the people in the west awaited his coming with much pleasure .
the president was justly entitled to this outing , for the nation was now at peace with the entire world , and never had business been so prosperous .
more than this , our affairs with other nations had been so handled that throughout the entire civilized world no ruler was more popular than was <name> <name> .
in england he was spoken of with the highest praise , and the regards of the germans had already been shown in the visit of <name> <name> to this country .
he was known to be vigorous to the last degree , but it was likewise realized that he was thoroughly honest and <unk> .
the first stop of the president in his trip west was made at chicago , where during the day he laid the <unk> of the new law building of the university of chicago , which university conferred upon him the degree of <unk> .
( doctor of laws ) .
in the evening he addressed an unusually large crowd at the <unk> building , speaking upon the <name> doctrine .
from chicago the president journeyed to <unk> , and then to st. <name> and minneapolis .
at the <unk> city he made a forceful address on the trusts , giving his hearers a clear idea of how the great corporations of to-day were brought into existence , and what may be done to control them , and in the <unk> city he spoke on the <unk> question of tariff .
it was an eventful week , and when <name> came the chief magistrate was glad enough to take a day of rest at <unk> falls , south <name> .
from there he journeyed to <unk> , montana , one of the entrances to that greatest of all american <unk> , yellowstone park .
it was understood that president <name> wished to visit the park without a great following of the general public , and this wish was carried out to the letter .
mr. <name> had with him the well-known naturalist , mr. <name> <unk> , and for about two weeks he enjoyed himself to his heart 's content , visiting many of the spots of interest and taking it easy whenever he felt so disposed .
it was not a hunting trip , although big game is plentiful enough in the park .
it was just getting " near to nature 's heart , " and mr. <name> afterward declared it to be one of the best outings he had ever experienced .

chapter xxix dedication of the fair buildings at st. <name>  continuation of the trip to san <name>  up in the far north-west  back in washington  the post-office <unk>  the new republic of panama  a canal at last  proclamation regarding the war between japan and russia  opening of the great fair after the refreshing tour of yellowstone park , president <name> journeyed across <unk> to omaha , then across iowa to keokuk , and from the latter city to st. <name> .
as before , he delivered a number of addresses , and wherever he spoke great crowds came to see and to hear him .
in these crowds were people of all political tendencies , but it made no difference if they were republicans , democrats , or <unk> , all were equally glad to greet the president of the united states and the hero of san <name> hill .
on this trip he frequently met some of the rough riders , and they invariably did all in their power to make him feel at home .
on the other hand he showed that he had not forgotten them .
" by <name> , i am glad to see you ! "
he would exclaim , catching an old comrade by the hand .
and his tone of voice would show that he meant just what he said .
for a long time the people of st. <name> had been preparing for a grand fair , to be known as the louisiana purchase exposition , to commemorate the purchasing from <name> of all that vast territory of the united states which lies between the mississippi river and the <name> mountains and the gulf of mexico and british <name> .
the purchase was made in <unk> for fifteen millions of dollars , and it was hoped to hold the exposition on the one hundredth anniversary , in 1903 , but matters were delayed , and so the fair was postponed until 1904 .
the dedication of the fair buildings at the exposition grounds was held on <name> 30 , 1903 , and was made a <name> occasion by those interested .
president <name> was invited to speak , and also <unk> <name> , and both made addresses of remarkable interest .
following the dedication exercises a grand banquet was given at which the scene of good-fellowship was one not readily forgotten .
the president wished the exposition well , and promised to do all in his power to make it a success .
although the president had already travelled many miles , the greater part of his western trip still lay before him .
from st. <name> he went to kansas city and to <unk> , where the citizens were as anxious to meet him as anywhere .
he stopped at <name> springs over <name> , and then went to <name> , and to various towns in colorado and in new mexico .
while in new mexico he became interested in the systems of irrigation there , and told the people what they might do if their systems of watering the ground were increased .
having passed through the grand cañon , the second week in may found him in southern california .
he visited los <name> , reviewing the annual <unk> parade , and many other points , and at <unk> addressed a great gathering of school children in a beautiful park filled with shrubs and flowers .
the children were decidedly enthusiastic over the meeting , and when mr. <name> went away , some <unk> him with flowers , which bombardment he took in good part .
president <name> 's visit to <name> <name> jr. university in california came next , and here the students cheered him with vigor .
he visited many of the more important buildings , and was entertained by members of the faculty .
his face was now set toward the golden gate , and san <name> was all alive to give him an ovation .
it was his first official visit to the pacific coast , and all whom he met vied with each other to do him honor , while they listened with great attention to what he had to say .
three days were spent in san <name> and vicinity , and three days more in a tour of the <unk> valley .
president <name> was particularly anxious to see some of the big trees of the state , and was driven to several that are well known .
the steps of the chief magistrate were now turned northward , to oregon , and a week was spent at portland , and in the towns and cities of the <unk> sound territory , and beyond .
here he saw much that was new and novel in the lumber trade and in the salmon industry , and was received with a warmth that could not be mistaken .
" he is a president for the whole country , no mistake about that , " said more than one .
" he makes you feel he is your friend the minute you lay eyes on him , " would put in another .
to many in this far corner of our country , this visit of the president <name> ever remain as a pleasant memory .
they could never <name> to get to washington , more than three thousand miles away , and to have him come out to see them was worth remembering .
the journey eastward was made through montana to salt lake city and then to <name> , where additional addresses were delivered .
from the latter point a fast train bore him homeward , and by the next <name> he was back in the white house once more , as fresh and hearty as ever , and well prepared to undertake whatever important work might come to hand .
and work was there in plenty .
among the first things taken up by the president was a scandal in the post-office department .
without loss of time president <name> ordered postmaster general <unk> to make a thorough investigation , with the result that many contracts which were harmful to our post-office system were annulled , and some <unk> were brought to justice .
toward the end of july there was considerable disturbance in the government printing office at washington because a certain assistant foreman , who had been discharged , was <unk> .
all of the <unk> were on the point of striking because they did not want the man returned , as he did not belong to their union .
but president <name> was firm in the matter ; and in the end the man went back , and there was no strike .
this affair caused an almost endless discussion in labor circles , some claiming that the union should have been upheld , while others thought differently .
during the summer , as was his usual habit , president <name> , with his family , spent part of his time at his country home at oyster bay .
this time the visit to the old homestead was of unusual interest , for , on <name> 17 , the north atlantic fleet of the navy visited that vicinity , for review and inspection by the president .
it was a <name> occasion , and the fleet presented a handsome appearance as it filed past and thundered out a presidential salute .
many distinguished guests were present , and all without exception spoke of the steady improvement in our navy as a whole .
president <name> was equally enthusiastic , and well he might be , for he had used every means in his power to make our navy all it should be .
late in <name> president <name> returned to washington , and on october 15 delivered the principal address at the <unk> of a statue of that grand military hero , general <name> .
here once more he was listened to with tremendous interest , delivering a speech that was patriotic to the core and full of inspiration .
for some time past matters in <unk> had been in a very mixed-up condition .
the united states were willing to take hold of the panama canal , as already mentioned , but although a treaty had been made to that effect , the <unk> government would not ratify the agreement .
on november 3 , the trouble in <unk> reached its <unk> point .
on that day the state of panama declared itself free and independent .
the people of that state wanted the canal built by the united states , and were very angry when the rest of the <unk> states would not agree to the treaty which had been made .
at once there were strong rumors of war , and a few slight attacks were really made .
the united states forbade the transportation of soldiers on the panama railroad , and a few days later recognized panama as an independent republic .
the new republic was likewise recognized by <name> , and , later still , by england .
on november 9 , panama appointed a commission to negotiate a canal treaty with our country , and this treaty was signed and sealed at washington by secretary of state hay , acting for the united states , and m. <unk> , acting for panama .
the president 's next message to congress went at great length into the question of the panama canal , and in defence of the recognition of the new republic .
it also told of what the new department of commerce and labor had accomplished , especially the branch devoted to corporations .
[ illustration : president <name> speaking at the <unk> of the statue of general <name> .
( photograph by <unk> , washington , <unk> ) ] " we need not be <unk> about the welfare of corporations which shrink from the light , " wrote mr. <name> .
and in this statement every one who had the best interests of our nation at heart agreed .
to accomplish great works great corporations are often necessary , but they must conduct business in such a fashion that they are not ashamed to show their methods to the public at large .
at the opening of the year 1904 there were strong rumors of a war between japan and russia , over the occupation of <unk> , and this war started early in february by a battle on the sea , wherein the russian fleet lost several war-ships .
this contest was followed by others of more or less importance , and it looked as if , sooner or later , other nations might become involved in the struggle .
" we must keep our hands off , " said president <name> , and at once issued a proclamation , calling on all good citizens to remain strictly neutral , and warning those who might take part that they could <name> for no aid from the united states should they get into trouble personally or have any property confiscated .
this proclamation was followed by some excellent work of our state department , whereby it was agreed among the leading nations that the zone of fighting should be a limited one ,  that is , that neither japan nor russia should be allowed to <name> it beyond a certain defined territory .
for many weeks congress had debated the panama canal treaty and the action of president <name> regarding the new republic of panama .
on february 23 , 1904 , a vote was taken in the senate , and the panama canal treaty was ratified in all particulars .
without delay some united states troops were despatched to panama , to guard the strip of land ten miles wide through which the canal is to run , and preparations were made to push the work on the <unk> without further delay .
on saturday , <name> 30 , the great world 's fair at st. <name> was formally opened to the public .
it had cost over fifty millions of dollars and was designed to eclipse any fair held in the past .
the opening was attended by two hundred thousand visitors , all of whom were more than pleased with everything to be seen .
it had been arranged that president <name> should formally open the exposition by means of telegraphic communications from the white house to the fair grounds .
a key of <name> and gold was used for the purpose , and as soon as it was touched a salute of twenty-one guns roared forth in the exposition 's honor .
around the president were assembled the members of his cabinet and representatives of many foreign nations .
before touching the key which was to set the machinery of the wonderful fair in motion , president <name> spoke as follows :  " i have received from the exposition grounds the statement that the management of the louisiana purchase exposition awaits the pressing of the button which is to transmit the electric energy which is to <unk> the flag and start the machinery of the exposition .
" i wish now to greet all present , and especially the representatives of the foreign nations here represented , in the name of the american people , and to thank these representatives for the parts their several countries have taken in being represented in this centennial anniversary of the greatest step in the movement which transformed the american republic from a small confederacy of states lying along the atlantic seaboard into a continental nation .
" this exposition is one primarily intended to show the progress in the industry , the science , and the <name> , not only of the american nation , but of all other nations , in the great and wonderful century which has just closed .
every department of human activity <name> be represented there , and perhaps i may be allowed , as honorary president of the athletic association which , under european management , started to revive the memory of the olympic games , to say that i am glad that , in addition to paying proper heed to the progress of industry , of science , of <name> , we have also paid proper heed to the development of the athletic <unk> which are useful in themselves as showing that it is wise for nations to be able to relax .
" i greet you all .
i appreciate your having come here on this occasion , and in the presence of you , representing the american government and the governments of the foreign nations , i here open the louisiana exposition . "
chapter xxx personal characteristics of <name> <name>  the <unk> family  life at the white house  our country and its future in reading over the foregoing pages the question may occur to some of my young readers , how is it possible for president <name> to accomplish so much and still have time in which to occasionally enjoy himself by travelling or by going on a hunting tour ?
the answer is a very simple one .
mr. <name> works systematically , as do all who want their labor to amount to something .
years ago , when he was physically weak , he determined to make himself strong .
he persisted in vigorous exercise , especially in the open air , and in the end attained a bodily health which any ordinary man may well envy .
the president does each day 's work as it comes before him .
he does not borrow trouble or cross a bridge before he comes to it .
whatever there is to do he does to the very best of his ability , and he allows future complications to take care of themselves .
if a mistake is made , he does not worry continually over it , but keeps it in mind , so that a like mistake shall not occur again .
when once his hand is on the plough , he does not believe in turning back .
he has unlimited <name> in the future of our glorious country , and a like <name> in the honor and courage of his fellow-citizens .
any man to be an intelligent worker can not be dissipated , and the president is a good illustration of this .
he has a good appetite , but eats moderately , and does not depend upon stimulants or tobacco to " brace him up " when the work is extra heavy .
he goes out nearly every day for a walk , a ride on horseback , or a drive with some members of his family , and as a result of this , when night comes , sleeps soundly and arises the next morning as bright and fresh as ever .
this is the first time that a president with a large family has occupied the white house .
other presidents have had a few children , but mr. <name> took possession with six , a hearty , romping crowd , the younger members of which thought it great fun to explore the executive mansion when first they moved in .
the president loves his children dearly , and is not above " playing bear " with the little ones when time permits and they want some fun .
of mrs. <name> it can truthfully be said that she makes a splendid " first <name> in the land . "
she takes a great interest in all social functions , and an equal interest in what is best for her boys and girls and their friends .
she is very charitable , and each year <unk> liberally to hundreds of bazaars and fairs held throughout our country .
the oldest child of the president is miss <name> <name> <name> , named after her mother , the first wife of the chief magistrate .
although but a <unk> to the present mrs. <name> , the two are as intimate and loving as if of the same flesh and blood .
miss <name> has already made her <unk> in washington society , and assisted at several gatherings at the white house .
all of the other children were born after mr. <name> 's second marriage .
his oldest son is <name> <name> , jr. , commonly called by his chums , <name> , <unk> .
he is a lad of sixteen , bright and clever , and has been attending a college preparatory school at <unk> , massachusetts , as already mentioned .
he loves outdoor games , and is said to possess many tastes in common with his father .
the other members of the family are , <name> , fourteen , <name> <unk> , twelve , <unk> bullock , nine , and a lively little boy named <name> , who is six .
some time ago a distinguished member of the english educational commission visited this country and made an inspection of our school system .
when asked what had impressed him most deeply , he answered :  " the children of the president of the united states sitting side by side with the children of your <unk> in the public schools . "
this simple little speech speaks volumes for the good , hard common sense of our president .
he believes thoroughly in our public institutions , and knows the real value of sending out his boys to fight their own battles in the world at large .
he does not believe in <unk> children , but in making them <unk> .
all love to go out with him , and when at oyster bay he frequently takes the boys and their cousins for a day's tramp through the woods or along the beach , or else for a good hard row on the bay .
the president prefers rowing to sailing , and frequently rows for several miles at a stretch .
his enjoyment of bathing is as great as ever , and his boys love to go into the water with him .
christmas time at the white house is just as full of <name> there as it is anywhere .
the younger children <name> up their stockings , and scream with delight over every new toy received .
for some days previous to christmas one of the rooms is turned into a storeroom , and to this only mrs. <name> and one of the maids hold the key .
presents come in from everywhere , including many for the president , for his friends far and near insist upon remembering him .
these presents are arranged on a large oval table near one of the broad windows , and on christmas morning the distribution begins .
the president , in his trips to the woods , has seen the great harm done by cutting down promising evergreens , so he does not believe very much in having a christmas tree .
but a year ago a great surprise awaited him .
" i 'm going to fix up a tree , " said little <name> , and managed to smuggle a small evergreen into the house and place it in a large closet that was not being used .
here he and his younger brother <name> worked for several days in arranging the tree just to suit them .
on christmas morning , after the presents were given out , both asked their father to come to where the closet was located .
" what is up now ? "
asked mr. <name> , curiously .
" come and see ! "
they shouted .
and he went , followed by all the others of the family .
then the closet door was thrown open , and there stood the tree , blazing with lights .
it was certainly a great surprise , and mr. <name> enjoyed it as much as anybody .
the children of washington , and especially those whose fathers occupy public positions , always look forward with anticipations of great pleasure to the children 's parties given by mrs. <name> , and these parties are of equal interest to those living at the mansion .
[ illustration : president <name> and his family .
( photograph by <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ] such a party was given during the last holidays , and was attended by several hundred children , all of whom , of course , came arrayed in their best .
they were received by mrs. <name> , who had a <unk> and a kind word for each , and then some of the cabinet ladies , who were assisting , gave to each visitor a button , set in ribbon and tinsel and inscribed " <name> christmas and happy new year . "
the big main dining-room of the white house had been prepared for the occasion .
there was a christmas tree at one side of the room , and the table was filled with fruit , cake , and <name> .
the president came in and helped to pass the ice-cream and cake , and <name> , jr. and some of the others passed the <name> and other good things .
after this the visitors were asked to go to the east room and dance .
the <name> band furnished the music , and while the children were dancing , the president came in to look at them .
the entertainment lasted until the end of the afternoon , and when the visitors departed , president <name> was at the door to shake hands and bid them good-by .
and here let us bid good-by ourselves , wishing <name> <name> and his family well .
what the future holds in store for our president no man can tell .
that he richly deserves the honors that have come to him , is beyond question .
he has done his best to place and keep our united states in the front rank of the nations of the world .
under him , as under president <name> , progress has been remarkably rapid .
in the uttermost parts of the world our flag is respected as it was never respected before .
perhaps some few mistakes have been made , but on the whole our advancement has been justified , and is eminently satisfactory .
the future is large with possibilities , and it remains for the generation i am addressing to rise up and embrace those opportunities and make the most of them .

<name> and <name> are aboard of their old ship , the columbia , bound from manila to nagasaki , with a cargo designed for the japanese government .
this is during the war between russia and japan , and when close to the japanese coast the schooner is sighted by a russian warship and made a prize of war .
as prisoners both <name> and <name> see something of life in the russian navy .
when close to <unk> , the russian warship falls in with several ships of the japanese fleet , and after a thrilling <unk> <unk> with her prize .
this brings <name> and <name> before admiral togo , and as <name> 's brother <name> , with their mutual friend , <name> pennington , is already in the japanese army , <name> enters the japanese navy and <name> follows suit .
the siege and bombardment of port <name> are at their height ; and the particulars are given of many battles both on the sea and on land , leading up to the ultimate surrender of that brave russian commander , general <unk> , and the fall of the city .
by this surrender the japanese obtained many thousands of prisoners of war , hundreds of cannon , with large quantities of ammunition , and several scores of vessels , useful for either fighting purposes or as transports .
moreover , this victory placed the entire southern portion of <unk> under japanese control , giving the army <unk> use of the railroad running from port <name> to <unk> , a city on the road to <unk> , captured some time before , as already related in another volume of this series , entitled " under the mikado 's flag . "
as i have mentioned in a previous work , it is as yet impossible to state what the outcome of this terrific conflict <name> be .
so far victory has perched largely upon the standard of japan .
the russian navy has been practically shattered and its army fought to a standstill .
the cost of the war has been tremendous to both countries .
countless thousands of lives have already been sacrificed .
would that peace were soon at hand !
again i thank my young friends for their appreciation of my former stories .
may the present tale fulfill every reasonable expectation .

fall of port <name>  conclusion 274 at the fall of port <name> at the fall of port <name> chapter i <name> and his friends " unless i miss my guess , <name> , we are going to have a storm . "
" jest what i was thinking , <name> .
and when it comes i allow as how it <name> be putty heavy , " replied <name> striker , casting an eye to the westward , where a small dark cloud was beginning to show above the horizon .
" well , we ca n't expect fine weather all the time , " went on <name> <name> , inspecting the cloud with equal interest .
" we want some wind anyway , " he added .
" we are not making this return trip to nagasaki nearly as fast as we made the trip to manila . "
<name> striker , a bronzed and weather-beaten yankee sailor , rubbed his <name> reflectively .
" i was jest thinking o ' the day i spied the old columbia in manila harbor , " he said , meditatively .
" tell ye , <name> , the sight 'most struck me dumb .
'the columbia , ' sez i to myself .
an' then i thought i must be <unk> ' .
i wanted to find this ship ag'in in the worst way . "
" the ship certainly seems like a home to me , <name>  and i reckon she always <name> seem that way .
i 've traveled a good many miles in her , since i first struck her at honolulu in the hawaiian islands , " responded <name> <name> .
" yes  both of us have .
but we never took no trip like this afore  carryin ' a cargo for the japanese government , with that government at war with russia . "
<name> striker lowered his voice .
" what's the outlook ?
does the old man reckon to fall in with a russian warship afore we can reach nagasaki ? "
" hush , <name> ; you must n't mention our cargo , " came from <name> <name> , hastily .
" i ai n't <unk> ' it to anybody but you . "
" captain ponsberry is in hopes that we shall not meet any russian warships . "
" but what if we do ? "
" then we shall have to show our heels as best we can . "
" a sailing vessel ca n't show much o ' a pair o ' heels to a man-o'-war . "
" that is true . "
" i suppose , if the columbia was overhauled by a russian warship , they 'd consider us a prize of war ; would n't they ? "
continued the old yankee sailor .
" they would , unless captain ponsberry could get out of it in some way . "
" how do you think he might get out of it ? "
" well , you must remember that our cargo does n't belong to the japanese government yet .
we are carrying it from manila to nagasaki for the richmond importing company .
the russians would have to prove their case against us before they could claim the schooner as a legitimate prize of war . "
" i see .
well , i reckon as how them russians would do 'most anything to square accounts with the japs .
so far , accordin ' to my notions , they have been <unk> ' ground right along in this war . "
" yes , and they 'll lose more before the japs are through with 'em , <name> .
but that storm is coming up fast , " went on <name> <name> , with another examination of the black cloud .
" i 'll have to tell the captain .
if we do n't shorten sail it may do us some damage . "
with the <unk> remark <name> <name> walked aft , toward the companionway of the columbia , a staunch <unk> schooner that hailed from gloucester .
he was second mate of the craft and as such it was now his duty to inform captain nat ponsberry that a storm was approaching .
to those of my young friends who have read " under <name> at manila " and other volumes of the " old <name> series " <name> <name> needs no introduction .
he was one of three brothers , who , left in the charge of a miserly <unk> , had thought it best to go away from home and seek fortune in various parts of the globe .
<name> had drifted to san <name> and then to honolulu , where he had fallen in with captain nat ponsberry and the columbia , as already mentioned .
he , with his sailor friend , <name> striker , had been cast away , and while adrift on the pacific had been picked up by the asiatic squadron under commodore ( afterward admiral ) <name> , to serve with honor during the memorable battle of manila bay .
since those days a great many things had occurred to the <name> boys .
<name> , the oldest of the three , had served as a young volunteer in cuba during the advance on <name> , and as an officer with the army in the philippines , and <name> , the third brother , had served in the navy in cuban waters and elsewhere .
in the meantime the miserly <unk> had reformed , and now thought " his three boys , " as he called them , " the best young fellers in all <name> , barrin ' none ! "
<name> <name> was a natural sailor , and when his term in the navy came to an end he could not bear to think of giving up the sea .
he heard that his old ship was bound for a trip to japan and other ports , and at once communicated with captain ponsberry , with the result that he became second mate of the schooner , the first mate being , as of old , <name> grandon , a personal friend of captain ponsberry .
at this time <name> <name> had gone into business , and was doing remarkably well .
but <name> was doing nothing , and <name> persuaded his oldest brother to come aboard the ship at manila , for the trip to nagasaki and port <name> .
this was just at the outbreak of the war between russia and japan , but the brothers at that time knew nothing about the tremendous conflict so close at hand .
the columbia was carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company , represented in japan and <name> by <name> pennington , who had served with <name> <name> in our army in cuba and the philippines .
from manila <name> had gone to <name> , to fight the <unk> , as already described in " on to pekin , " the first volume of this " soldiers of fortune series . "
with the end of the boxer conflict , lieutenant pennington , as he had then become , turned from war to business , and soon made a number of business transactions which were highly gratifying to the company that he represented .
when the columbia arrived at nagasaki , captain ponsberry learned that the war had begun and that to get to port <name>  a russian stronghold in <unk>  was out of the question .
while he was awaiting orders <name> pennington appeared on the scene .
<name> had had great difficulties in getting away from port <name> , having been suspected by the russian officials of being a spy .
he wished to know at once if the ship 's cargo was safe .
" as safe as when we left home , " had been captain ponsberry 's reply .
" good ! "
answered the young agent , and then he wished to know if anything had been done about selling the goods .
captain ponsberry replied that he had been ordered to do nothing until he received word from <name> .
this suited the young representative ; and the upshot of the matter was that the cargo , instead of going to a russian port , was sold to the japanese government at a price considerably above the ordinary market value .
<name> pennington was enthusiastic about joining the japanese army for a campaign in <unk> and he imparted a large share of this enthusiasm to <name> <name> .
as a result both enlisted and became captains in a special command , under a <name> okopa , who could speak very good english .
the part of the army to which they were assigned landed at <unk> , in <unk> , and in the second volume of this series , called " under the mikado 's flag , " i related the particulars of the crossing of the <unk> river and of the many skirmishes and battles leading up to the terrific <unk> ' contest before <unk> <name> .
during these fights <name> and <name> did their full duty as officers , and when the russians retreated to the north both were well content to take a <unk> rest .
but additional struggles were still in store for them , as <name> be learned in the pages which follow .
at first <name> <name> had been inclined to follow his brother and his friend <name> into the japanese army .
but captain ponsberry did not wish to lose his services as a second mate , and when it was decided that the columbia should make a quick run to manila and back , for another cargo for the japanese government , he made up his mind to stick to the ship .
the run to manila from nagasaki was made without special incident , and , once at the main seaport of the philippines , captain ponsberry lost no time in getting on board the cargo the richmond importing company had ready for him .
the cargo was a valuable one and it was calculated that if rightly sold it would yield the company a profit of five or six thousand dollars .
" you have got to take care and not run into any russian warship , " said the agent of the company at manila .
" if you do you may have a whole lot of trouble in explaining matters to the russian <unk> satisfaction .
i see by the reports that the russians have already held up several english and south american ships . "
" i shall keep a sharp lookout for 'em , " was captain ponsberry 's reply .
" and another thing , captain , " went on the agent , in a lower tone ; " you want to watch your crew . "
" what do you mean ? "
" i do n't like the looks of two or three of them .
for all you know they may be more than willing to expose you  if you fall in with the russians .
can you trust your first and second mates ? "
" i can !
they are as honest as myself . "
" then caution them to keep an eye on the hands .
one of those fellows looks like a russian to me  the chap with the heavy black beard . "
" you mean semmel .
he says he is a pole and that he hates the russians . "
" humph !
well , i saw him talking to a lot of russians night before last .
and when they passed a jap the whole crowd jeered at the little brown man . "
" semmel , too ? "
" yes . "
" then i shall watch him , " answered captain ponsberry , decidedly .
" do , but do n't let him know it .
some of these foreign sailors are ugly when they find out they are being suspected . "
" trust me to manage him , " returned the commander of the columbia ; and there the talk on the subject came to an end .
chapter ii a storm on the pacific <name> found captain ponsberry working over a chart on the cabin table , laying out the course of the ship .
the commander of the columbia was a bluff , hearty individual and he and the young second mate thought a great deal of each other .
" well , what is it ? "
asked the captain , looking up quickly .
" i came to report that a storm is coming up from the west , " answered <name> .
" humph !
i was afraid we 'd catch it sooner or later .
is it close up yet ? "
" it 's coming up pretty fast . "
captain ponsberry said no more , but threw down his parallel rulers and his pencil .
catching up his cap , he mounted to the deck , and the young second mate followed at his heels .
the captain gave a long look to the westward and then a gaze around the remainder of the horizon .
" tell cal <name> to call all hands to shorten sail ! "
he called out to <name> .
" tell 'em to tumble up quick , too  thet storm ai n't none too far off for comfort ! "
<name> passed the word to cal <name> , who was the boatswain of the columbia , and soon the whistle piped up shrilly , and those who were below or in the forecastle , came on deck in a hurry .
already the wind was <unk> , <unk> up the <unk> in all directions .
the sky , that had been so blue a short while before , became leaden , and the depths of the ocean took on a somber <name> .
the barometer indicated a great and immediate change .
" lay aloft there , men ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" our sails are mostly new and we do n't want them ripped up if we can help it .
skip along there , peterson ! "
the latter words to a big sailor who was moving across the deck at a snail 's pace .
the sailor addressed , scowled .
it was not his watch on deck and he hated to have his midday nap disturbed .
" got a nail in <name> boot , " he said .
" well , haul it out  after the sails are trimmed , " returned the captain , and then turned to another hand : " semmel , what 's the matter with you ? "
this to the <unk> sailor with the heavy black beard .
" nodding , " grumbled semmel , and turned away sulkily .
" then get a move on , or we may lose a stick as well as a sail , " and there followed a perfect volley of orders in a tone that none of the sailors misunderstood .
up to the yards they crawled like so many monkeys , and soon the creaking of <unk> blocks was heard , as the <unk> came down .
the jib and flying jib were also taken in , and a little later the <unk> and the <unk> .
" reckon we can stand the <unk> for a little while longer , " said captain ponsberry to <name> grandon .
" what do you think ? "
" we can , unless it comes quicker nor it is coming now , " returned the first mate .
" well , keep an eye on the wind and reef her as soon as it begins to look nasty , " said captain ponsberry , and returned to the cabin , to finish his nautical calculations .
the columbia had left the last of the philippines behind and was headed north through the <name> sea toward the lower extremity of <unk> .
she was not as new a ship as when <name> had first boarded her at honolulu , for since that time she had seen half a dozen years of hard service .
but captain ponsberry was a careful man and believed in making repairs as soon as they were needed , so there was small danger of her opening her seams or going to pieces even in the <unk> of blows .
she leaked a little  the best of ships do that  but a short pumping every morning kept the water at the bottom of the well .
as second mate , it was <name> 's duty to see that everything on the deck was " <unk> , " and this was especially necessary when a storm was coming up .
he made a tour of the ship , his keen eyes taking in every detail .
as it happened , an hour before he had set the sailor semmel to work stowing away some odds and ends of rope .
he had supposed that this task was long since finished , but now he found the ropes scattered about as before .
" see here , semmel , " he called out , " why did n't you stow away those ropes as i told you ? "
" stow dem avay in a leetle vile , " answered the sailor with the heavy beard .
" you 'll stow them away now , " returned <name> , sharply .
he did not at all fancy the manner of the hand he was addressing .
" i told you to do it an hour ago .
we do n't want anything loose on deck when this storm hits us . "
" <name> kicked de ropes out dare , " growled semmel .
" i had nodding to do mit 'em . "
" that is n't here or there .
i told you to stow them away , and i want you to do it .
if you do n't , i 'll have to report you to the captain . "
" oh , i do him ! "
grumbled semmel , but he glared at <name> as if he wished to chew the young second mate up .
" you put all dare <unk> on me , hey ? "
he added , after a pause .
" you 've got to do your share of it . "
" humph ! "
semmel seemed on the point of saying more , but shut his teeth and began to arrange the ropes in proper order .
<name> watched him for a moment and then walked away .
as soon as his back was turned the sailor shook his fist at the young second mate .
" you <unk> ! "
he muttered .
" chust <unk> , you <unk> rat ! "
the sky kept growing darker , and soon came a puff of wind much heavier than any that had gone before .
the columbia had been moving over the waves on an even keel , but now she gave a sudden lurch to starboard .
" reckon it 's time to take them reefs in the <unk> , " said grandon to <name> , and soon the sailors were at work on the sheets , leaving just sufficient canvas up to make the schooner mind her helm .
it was hard work , for the sudden gusts made the sail snap and crack like a whip .
so far it had not rained a drop , but now came a sudden downpour , the drops " as big as hen 's eggs , " to use <name> striker 's manner of describing them .
then came a flash of lightning out of the western sky , followed by a rumble of thunder .
" this is going to be an old-time storm , " was <name> 's comment , as he met <name> striker near the forecastle .
" i 'll have to get my oilskin out . "
<name> already had his <unk> on and soon the young mate was similarly provided .
wind and rain were increasing , and presently there came a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder that made everybody jump .
the thunder brought captain ponsberry to the deck in a hurry .
" did that hit us ? "
he questioned , looking around anxiously .
" no , sir , but it was pretty close , " replied grandon .
" is everything secure ? "
went on the commander , to <name> .
" yes , sir . "
it was difficult to converse further , for the wind was now whistling through the rigging , driving the rain in sheets across the deck .
all had to hold fast for fear of being swept overboard .
on every side the sea was lashing itself into a foam and the waves were growing higher and higher .
at one instant the columbia would seem to be riding on top of a mountain , the next she would sink down and down into the trough of the sea .
" well , <name> , how do you like this ? "
questioned captain ponsberry , as he took a position beside the second mate .
" oh , i do n't mind it at all , " was the cheery answer .
" i used to mind the storms , but i 've got used to them . "
" this is n't a plaything we are getting . "
" oh , i know that  you can see it by the way the wind is driving us .
but we are not near any land , are we ? "
" no . "
" then we 'll be sure to <unk> it .
i feel i can bank on the old columbia for almost anything . "
at this captain ponsberry laid an affectionate hand on his second <unk> shoulder .
" reckon you love the old craft about as well as i do , " he said .
" i do n't know about that  you 've been on board so many more years than myself .
but to me she is a second home . "
" i see .
well , let us <name> we get through with this trip in safety . "
" do n't you imagine we 'll do it ? "
questioned <name> , quickly .
" certainly .
but you must remember that we may have trouble if we fall in with any russian warship . "
captain ponsberry lowered his voice .
" did you have trouble with semmel ? "
" a little .
i ordered him to coil up some ropes and he did n't obey me right away .
but he stowed them away afterwards . "
captain ponsberry <name> a long breath .
" the more i see of that chap the less i like him . "
" i never liked him from the start , " answered <name> , frankly .
" but you'll have to give him credit for being a good <unk> sailor . "
" there is no doubt but what he is that , <name> .
but he has a bad eye . "
" what do you think he could do to harm us ? "
" nothing  unless we fell in with a russian warship .
in that case , if he was a russian <unk> , he might expose the fact that while we are carrying a cargo for the richmond importing company the goods are really meant for the japanese government . "
" does he know that ? "
" i 'm not sure , one way or the other .
what i am afraid of is , that he may know a good bit more nor we suspect . "
" i see . "
the young second mate mused for a moment .
" i 'll tell you what i 'd do , if i thought he was going to play me foul  and we fell in with a russian warship .
i 'd clap him below decks , out of sight until the warship went on her way again . "
" that 's easily said ; but i ca n't make him a prisoner unless i can prove something against him . "
" you can lock him up if he is sulky and wo n't obey orders . "
" yes , that is true .
still   phew ! "
the captain broke off short , for a vivid streak of lightning flared all over the upper masts of the ship .
the <unk> was as sharp as it was deafening , and for the moment all on board thought the columbia had surely been struck .
then came a downpour which made even the boldest of the sailors seek shelter .
" that was closer than i like , " was <name> 's comment , after it was ascertained that the ship was unharmed .
" 'most knocked me overboard , " came from <name> striker .
" gosh !
reckon my hair 's singed , " and he put up his hand and ran his fingers through his <unk> locks .
" do n't want another like thet nohow ! "
a few minutes later came another flash of lightning , but this was to the eastward , showing that the center of the storm had passed them .
the wind was apparently going down , but the sea was as angry as ever and would be for hours to come .
<name> had retired to the forecastle with several other sailors .
<unk> watch on deck was also at an end , and he was just on the point of going below , when from the west came a curious humming sound which made the young second mate pause .
the humming increased , and then of a sudden the columbia was caught in a hurricane blast that threw her far over on her side .
" help ! "
<name> heard , in the voice of captain ponsberry .
" somebody help me , quick , or i 'll go overboard ! "
chapter iii <name> learns something the accident which had happened to captain nat ponsberry was certainly a curious one , although similar to that which once cost the life of a young officer in our navy .
when the hurricane blast reached the columbia , the captain was in the act of slipping on a lined <unk> ,  a big affair , with long sleeves and an extra high collar .
one arm was in the coat and the other was going down the sleeve when it caught in the lining .
at that instant the shock threw the captain across the deck and almost over the railing .
he caught at the railing with his free hand , but his other hand remained a prisoner in the coat sleeve , while the garment itself stuck in a bunch across his shoulders .
" help ! "
he roared again .
he tried to pull himself up , and to free the hand in the sleeve , but found both impossible .
<name> did not wait for a second cry for assistance .
he knew the captain so well that he felt the officer would only call when in dire peril .
he ran out on the slippery deck in double-quick order .
" hullo , where are you ? "
he yelled .
" here !
help ! "
the young second mate caught sight of the captain not a moment too soon .
another lurch of the columbia had thrown him completely over the rail , and there he clung with one hand , while the spray was flying all over him .
not waiting to count the possible cost , <name> slid rather than ran to the rail .
years before he had learned a trick which now stood him in good stead .
he wound his legs around the under rail , catching the upper one with his left hand .
then he clutched captain ponsberry by the <unk> arm .
" on deck there ! "
he yelled .
" throw a rope this way , and hurry up about it ! "
" what 's the trouble ? "
came from <name> grandon , who had been in another part of the ship and had not heard the captain 's cry .
" the captain is almost overboard .
throw us a rope . "
<name> grandon was quick to act .
the rope came whizzing toward <name> , and in a twinkling he had it around his body and also around the captain .
" haul in ! "
he called , and grandon and two sailors did so .
over the rail came captain ponsberry , still fighting to release the <unk> arm .
in a moment more all danger was past .
" well , how in the world did this happen ? "
questioned grandon .
" tell ye  soon as i can git free o ' this <unk> coat ! "
spluttered captain ponsberry , and he gave the garment a jerk that ripped one of the sleeves completely in half .
" did ye ever see sech foolishness ? "
he added .
and then he told how the lurch of the ship had carried him over the rail just when he could use but one hand .
" after this i reckon i'll put on my coat afore i go on deck , " he concluded .
" it was a lucky thing that <name> heard you cry out , " said the first mate .
" i was at the wheel , helping <unk> . "
" that 's right , <name> . "
the captain turned to the youth .
" <name> , you 're a brave one , and always was .
i ai n't going to forget this ! "
" oh , do n't say anything about it , " came from the young second mate , modestly .
" i know you 'd do as much for me , if i needed it . "
" well , i would , an ' there 's my hand on it , " cried captain ponsberry , heartily , and gave <name> a grip that made him wince .
the storm kept up for the remainder of the day .
but its worst fury was spent , and during the night the wind went down to nothing more than a stiff breeze , which was just what was wanted .
all of the sails were again set ; and the schooner resumed her course as before .
before leaving manila <name> had purchased a number of newspapers printed in that city in english .
so far he had had no chance to look the sheets over , but now came two days in which there was little to do , and he spent several hours in devouring the news , while he also let his friend <name> do some reading .
" tell ye what , this 'ere war between russia and japan is goin ' to be a big thing , " said <name> , after reading an account of the first fights on land and on sea .
" it ai n't goin ' to be no such short affair as our little <unk> in <unk> . "
" you are right , <name> ; this war is going to be a long and bitter one . "
" who is goin ' to win , do you think ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know .
russia is a vast country , with millions of people and with an immense army and navy .
i suppose she can put five times as many men in the field as japan can . "
" but them japs know how to fight . "
" indeed they do  they have proved that already .
and what is to their advantage , they are closer to <unk> and <unk> than russia is .
they can get on the fighting ground quicker ,  which counts for a good deal . "
" how those russians must have been astonished when the japanese warships sailed into 'em at port <name> last february .
i do n't believe they were expecting an attack . "
" hardly , for war had just been declared .
but you would n't have caught uncle <name> napping like that , <name> . "
" right ye are , lad ; it ai n't his style .
an ' then to see how them japs have been <unk> ' up the russian warships ever since .
they must have a fine navy . "
" yes , and good gunners , too .
i was told in nagasaki that quite a few american gunners were on their ships  fellows who served under <name> at manila and under sampson and schley off cuba . "
" i believe you , lad .
when a feller gits it in his bones to fight on a warship there ai n't no life on a merchantman goin ' to satisfy him .
some jackies would rather fight nor eat  you know thet as well as i do . "
" well , i should n't mind doing some fighting myself .
you know i was on a stand about going with <name> and <name> pennington . "
" where do you reckon they are now ? "
" in <unk> , i suppose , fighting as hard as they can .
i thought i would get a letter from them before we left manila , but nothing came . "
" i suppose the mails are all upset , on account of the war , " put in cal <name> , who sat nearby , sewing a button on his shirt .
" if you'll remember , nagasaki was in a big state of excitement while we were there last . "
" did they say anything about any russian warships bein ' in these parts ? "
questioned <name> .
" no . "
" it would be strange if we did fall in with them . "
" which puts me in mind , " came from the boatswain , and then he gazed around to see if any other persons were near .
" semmel says he ai n't no russian , but it 's dollars to doughnuts he is , " he continued , in a lowered tone .
" have you discovered anything new ? "
demanded <name> .
" yes and no .
last night i overheard him and peterson talking in a suspicious kind of a way .
i did n't catch much , for they talked partly in english and partly in a foreign language .
but i am sure they are <unk> russia , and semmel said something about doing something to harm japan . "
" i do n't see how they could do anything on board of this ship , " came from <name> .
" you did n't hear anything definite ? "
" ca n't say that i did , " answered the boatswain .
" we had better watch them closer than ever . "
" all right ; i 'll do my share , " responded <name> , and <name> striker said the same .
that very afternoon <name> had another quarrel with the sailor with the long beard .
semmel had a bucket of dirty water which he was carrying to the ship 's side .
as <name> passed he pretended to <unk> his toe and allowed some of the dirty water to flow over the young second <unk> foot .
" semmel , what did you do that for ? "
cried <name> , indignantly .
" <unk> help dat , " said the sailor .
" i slip . "
" you did it on purpose ! "
" oh , no ! "
and the sailor grinned wickedly .
" i say you did .
if you try anything like that again , i 'll make it warm for you .
get a swab and clean the deck up at once ! "
as semmel sauntered off , and while <name> was stamping the water from his shoe , captain ponsberry came up .
he had seen the trick played from a distance .
" what did you tell semmel ? "
he questioned , sharply .
" told him to swab the deck up .
i think he <unk> the dirty water over me on purpose . "
" just my idea of it .
i 'll tell him what i think of it . "
and striding after the bearded sailor captain ponsberry gave him a lecture not to be readily forgotten .
" i wo n't have any of your dirty underhanded work aboard of my ship , " he concluded .
" either you 'll behave yourself , or i 'll put you in irons . "
" in irons ! "
ejaculated semmel , scowling viciously .
" that is what i said and that is what i mean .
ever since you came on board you have been acting in this same dirty fashion and i want it stopped .
now swab up that deck , and see that you make a first-class job of it .
for two pins i 'd make you black <name> 's shoes . "
" no black nobody 's shoes , " growled semmel , but in such a low tone that captain ponsberry could not hear him .
he cleaned the deck in his own ugly , independent manner , muttering imprecations against both <name> and the captain in the meantime .
as a matter of fact , even though he had denied it to captain ponsberry and others , ostag semmel was really a russian by birth , having been born and raised in the seaport of <unk> .
he had been drafted into the army , but not wishing to serve under a military rule which is unusually severe , he had run away to sea and become a sailor .
life on the ocean suited semmel very well and he would have remained away from russia had it not been for the fact that a <name> uncle had died leaving him a property valued at two thousand dollars  a small fortune in the eyes of a man of this russian 's standing .
he wished to go back to claim his inheritance , but feared to do so , for he knew that once on russian soil he would be arrested for desertion , and might be sent to a military prison for a great number of years .
from a friend in manila he had heard of something which interested him greatly .
this was the news that another deserter from the russian army had been pardoned for his offense because he had taken home with him important news concerning the movements of a certain japanese warship .
" if i could only do as well , " he told himself , over and over again , and then , when he signed articles for the <unk> trip , he listened eagerly to some talk he overheard about the ship 's cargo .
when he began to suspect the truth  that the cargo was meant for the japanese government  his eyes glistened cunningly .
" if i can only let russia know of this ! "
he reasoned .
" all <name> go well with me .
if i can only let russia know ! "
chapter iv the russian sailor 's plot captain ponsberry 's stern manner made ostag semmel wild with hatred , and when he went back to the forecastle after <unk> up the deck he was in a fit mental condition for almost any dark deed .
for a good half-hour he lay in his bunk in a corner , brooding over his ill-luck and wondering what he could do to revenge himself upon both the master of the schooner and <name> .
<name> he especially disliked  the very <unk> of the young second mate made him long to do the lad harm .
at the end of the half-hour another sailor came in .
it was <name> peterson , his close friend .
peterson was a burly tar who had visited nearly every quarter of the globe .
he loved to drink and <unk> , and was ever ready to lend a hand in any excitement that offered .
there was a rumor that he had once led a mutiny on a danish merchant vessel , but this he denied , laying the blame entirely on others .
" is that you , peterson ? "
demanded semmel , in his native tongue , for he knew that the other could speak russian fluently .
" yes , " came in a rough voice from peterson .
he gave a coarse laugh .
" a fine job you made of it , to pour dirty water over <name> and then have to swab up the deck for it . "
" who told you of that ? "
" did n't i see it with my own eyes  and heard what the captain said , too . "
" bah !
it makes me sick ! "
growled semmel .
" i am sick of the ship  the crew  everything ! "
peterson gave a short toss of his head , which was covered with a shock of fiery red hair .
" what are you going to do about it ?
even if the captain treats you like a dog , what shall you do , ostag semmel ?
he thinks we are all curs  door mats to wipe feet on ! "
" he shall find out that i am neither a dog nor a door mat ! "
muttered the bearded russian .
" by my right hand i promise you that ! "
" talk is cheap  it takes wind to make the mill go , " answered peterson .
to an outsider it would have been plain to see that he was leading semmel on , in an endeavor to find out what was in his companion 's mind .
" it <name> not end in talk . "
" bah !
i have heard that before . "
" i have been thinking , " went on ostag semmel , slowly .
" can i trust you ? "
" you know you can . "
" you do not love the captain  do not love that <name> ? "
" do i act as if i did ? "
" good !
now , how many on board of this ship ? "
" fourteen men , counting in ourselves . "
" you count fairly .
fourteen , how many are our friends ? "
" <unk> and conroy , at least . "
" then we are four , so far .
now , what of <unk> and shamhaven and <name> <name> ? "
" <unk> is a good fellow and a man who wishes to make money . "
" and shamhaven <name> do almost anything for money  he once told me so .
he took a sailor suit from a store in manila without paying for it . "
" i know that too .
the tailor was <name> and did n't need the money , " and peterson gave another coarse laugh .
" then we are six  to stand up for our rights .
and <name> <name> <name> make seven  just half the number on the ship . "
" how can we count that <name> in ?
he is a yankee . "
" he is a <unk> and we can manage him ,  and i think we can manage some others , too  when we get that far . "
" how far do you mean ? "
demanded peterson , although he knew about what was coming .
" is anybody else near here ? "
" no , " and peterson took a careful look around .
" supposing we seize the ship  in the name of the russian government ?
they have a japanese cargo on board , the captain can not deny it .
we can take the ship , sail her to some russian port , and win both prize money and <name> .
is it not a grand scheme ? "
" <name> , that is fine ! "
<name> peterson 's eyes glowed <unk> .
" ostag , you are a man after my own heart !
we might become <name> ! "
" then you like the plan ? "
" yes  providing we can make it work .
but it is a big undertaking .
if we were caught we might swing from a <unk> for it . "
" we can make it work  i have another plan for that .
i have thought it out completely .
we can  but more later , " and ostag semmel broke off abruptly , as several sailors entered the forecastle .
a little later he began to complain in broken english to a sailor named <name> <name> that he was suffering from a severe stomach ache .
" sorry to hear on it , " said <name> , who was a very mild foremast hand .
" anything i can do for you ? "
" i dink not , " answered semmel .
" i dink de poor grub ve git mak me feel pad . "
" did n't notice that the grub was poor , " answered <name> .
" very poor  not so goot as py my las ' ship , " answered semmel .
" some grub here not fit to eat . "
it was soon noised around that semmel was not feeling well and that he had complained that the food dealt out at <unk> had made him sick .
as soon as captain ponsberry heard of this he went to interview <name> , the colored cook , who , as of old , was singing gayly to himself among the pots and pans of the ship 's galley .
" was n't nuffin de <unk> wid dat grub , cap'n ponsberry , " exclaimed <name> , after hearing what the commander of the ship had to say .
" it was <name> as good as we always has . "
" was it thoroughly cooked ? "
" yes , sah  i do n't <unk> nuffin to go from dis yere galley 'less it am well cooked . "
" are your pots and kettles clean ? "
" yes , sah  yo ' can see fo ' yourself , sah . "
the captain did see , and moreover he knew that <name> was usually a careful and conscientious culinary artist who always gave the men the best his stock afforded .
" well , be careful of what you cook and how you cook it after this , " said captain ponsberry .
" would yo ' mind tellin ' me , sah , who is kicking , sah ? "
asked <name> , respectfully .
" semmel says he was made sick by what he ate . "
" huh , dat <unk> ! "
grunted <name> .
" he ai n't no <unk> at all , he ai n't ! "
and the cook turned away in disgust .
" it looks to me as if semmel was trying to make trouble all around , " said <name> grandon , when he and the captain and <name> talked the matter over .
" i never liked that man from the first time i clapped eyes on him , " came from <name> .
" he 's a sneak  and worse . "
" i shall watch him pretty closely after this , " said captain ponsberry .
" one discontented fellow like him can upset the whole ship if he sets out to do it . "
" they ca n't complain of the grub , " went on the first mate .
" it 's as good as on any merchantman , and better than the law requires . "
" i guess it was the <unk> that gave him the stomach ache , " said <name> , and this made the captain and grandon smile .
the next day when the sailors sat down to their dinner two or three of them sniffed suspiciously at the food they were eating .
" this do n't taste just right to me , " said shamhaven .
" the meat tastes decayed . "
" and the vegetables ai n't much better , " put in conroy ,  a sturdy <unk> , who was one of the best seamen on the schooner .
" dat dinner am <unk> , " cried <name> .
" i ai n't gwine to stand yere an' see you <unk> ' at it . "
" it certainly tastes a bit off , <name> , " put in <name> <name> .
" taste it yourself . "
the cook did so , and his face looked doubtful for a moment .
" guess dat needs a little salt an ' pepper , " he said , slowly .
it did not taste nearly as good as he had anticipated .
as there was nothing else to do , and they were hungry , the men ate the meal , grumbling to themselves as they did so .
<name> said but little and ate sparingly , and his example was followed by cal <name> .
the captain , grandon , and <name> ate in the cabin and the dinner served to them was first-class in every particular .
" guess <name> is spreading himself , just to show what he can do , " remarked <name> to the first mate , after he had finished his repast .
" it 's very good , <name> , " answered <name> grandon .
by the middle of the afternoon three of the men were complaining of feeling sick and all attributed their ailments to what they had eaten for dinner .
" <name> !
vat i tole you ? "
cried semmel .
" did n't i say de grub vos pad ?
not maybe you belief me , hey ? "
" i <name> n't stand for any more poor grub , " came from shamhaven .
" if i ca n't get good stuff i 'm going to the captain about it . "
the sickness of the hands worried captain ponsberry greatly and he opened up his medicine chest and gave them such remedies as he thought were best .
at supper time <name> was extra cautious in selecting and preparing the food .
nevertheless , the men who ate of it were suspicious and more than half the meal went to waste .
the captain was very thoughtful , but said little or nothing .
on the following day the wind died down utterly and it was exceedingly warm .
with nothing to do , the majority of the hands gathered at the bow to talk of matters in general , and the food in particular .
semmel and peterson were of the number , and both did all in their power to magnify the outrage , as they termed it .
" der captain do n't haf any right to gif us such grub , " said semmel .
" it vos against der law . "
" on some ships there would be a mutiny over this , " added peterson .
<name> overheard a part of the conversation and it set him thinking .
<name> striker also grew suspicious .
" unless i am mistaken , this is some of semmel 's work , " said <name> to the old tar .
" he is doing his level best to make trouble on the ship . "
" well , he better mind his business , " grumbled <name> .
" i do n't reckon the captain <name> stand fer any underhanded work . "
without appearing to do so , <name> continued to keep his eyes on semmel , and about an hour before dinner he saw the bearded sailor approach the cook 's galley and look inside .
<name> was below , getting a case of canned goods .
with a swift movement , semmel stepped into the galley , raised the lid of a big pot full of stew that was on the stove , and sprinkled something over the food .
then he hurried out and sneaked forward once more .
" the rascal ! "
murmured <name> .
" so this is his game .
i wonder what he put into that pot ? "
for the moment the young second mate thought to confront semmel and demand an explanation .
then he changed his mind and hurried for the cabin , to tell the news to captain ponsberry .
chapter v signs of a mutiny " i 've found out something important , captain ponsberry , " said <name> , as he entered the cabin .
" i now know what 's the matter with the grub . "
to all salt-water sailors food is grub and nothing else .
" well , what is the matter with it ? "
questioned the master of the columbia , quickly .
" it 's being doctored , that 's what 's the matter . "
" doctored ? "
" yes , sir ,  doctored by semmel , too . "
" <name> you explain what you mean , <name> ? "
demanded the captain , intensely interested .
" i just saw that rascal go into the cook 's galley .
<name> was n't there , and semmel took the lid off of a big pot on the stove and sprinkled something inside . "
" what ! "
captain ponsberry leaped to his feet " are you certain of this ? "
he demanded .
" i am  for i saw it with my own eyes . "
" what was that stuff he put into the pot ? "
" i do n't know . "
" did he touch anything else ? "
" no .
he was in a tremendous hurry and was n't in the galley more than a minute at the most . "
" the scoundrel ! "
captain ponsberry clenched his fists .
" <name> , you are positive you are making no mistake ? "
" i saw the thing done just as i told you .
the stuff was in a bit of white paper .
when he went forward he threw the paper overboard . "
" did anybody else see this ? "
" i do n't think so .
but   " at that moment came a knock on the cabin door and <name> striker appeared .
" excuse me , sir , " he said , touching his cap .
" but i 've got something important to report . "
" what is it , striker ? "
" i <name> see that air semmel go in and out o ' the cook 's galley . "
" that is just what i am reporting ! "
cried <name> .
" did you see what he did , <name> ? "
" no .
he was n't in there only a minit .
it looked suspicious to me , though  with all hands gittin ' sick from the grub . "
" this is all the evidence i want , " said captain ponsberry .
" we 'll soon make an end of this .
<name> , send semmel to me . "
the young second mate left the cabin with <name> and both hurried toward the bow , where semmel and peterson were conversing in low tones .
" the captain wants to see you at once , " said <name> to the bearded sailor .
his tone was so sharp it made semmel start .
" vat he <unk> ? "
he queried .
" go and find out for yourself . "
" maybe you git me in <unk> , hey ? "
and the bearded sailor scowled .
" i reckon as how you 're gittin ' yourself into trouble , " drawled <name> , dryly .
" you keep your <unk> shut ! "
cried semmel .
" i no talk to you , no ! "
" the captain wants you to report ; are you going to do so or not ? "
demanded <name> .
" sure i go , " answered semmel , with a toss of his head , and he slouched toward the stern .
his manner was so aggressive that <name> picked up a <unk> pin before following him .
captain ponsberry had just appeared on deck .
he had armed himself with a short club ,  a sure sign to those who knew him that something unusual was in the wind .
his face was stern and forbidding , and all hands gathered around to see what was the trouble .
" semmel , i want to have a talk with you , " he said , in a loud voice , as the bearded sailor came up .
to this the sailor nodded but did not answer .
" i want to know what you were doing in the cook 's galley a short while ago . "
" de cook 's galley ? "
the sailor acted as if he was puzzled .
" i no go by de galley , captain . "
" you were in the galley and you put something into the <unk> .
what was it ? "
thundered captain ponsberry .
" tell me the truth , or i may take it into my head to break every bone in your body ! "
and he shook his club in the sailor 's face .
" i put noddings in de pot , " cried semmel .
" i no go in de galley  i no been in de galley two , tree days .
it is a lie ! "
" i saw you go in , " came from <name> .
" and so did i , " added <name> .
" and i saw you <unk> something into the pot . "
" what , did dat <unk> <unk> put <unk> in <name> <unk> ' ? "
shrieked <name> , who had come up .
" oh ,  yo '  yo '   " " never mind , <name> , i 'll attend to this , " interrupted the captain .
" yes , sah , but dat <unk>   " " never mind now  fall back there , " added the captain , and the cook fell back , but shook his fist at semmel .
" i not in de galley , " reiterated the bearded sailor .
" <name> an' striker no tell de truth . "
" it is true , " cried <name> .
" thet 's so , an ' you ca n't squirm out o ' it , " broke in <name> .
" i saw ye as plain as day . "
" i want to know what you put into that <unk> ? "
continued captain ponsberry .
" i no go near de galley .
i   " " i know you went into the galley and i know you put something into the stew .
for the last time i ask you , what was it ? "
for reply ostag semmel simply shrugged his shoulders .
" are you going to tell me the truth ? "
" i reckon the truth ai n't in him , " grumbled <name> , under his breath .
" i say noddings more , " came sourly from the bearded sailor .
" put that man in irons , " commanded captain ponsberry , turning quickly to <name> and grandon .
" if he wo n't talk now , perhaps he 'll talk after he has spent a day in the brig . "
" vat !
you put me in irons ! "
shrieked semmel .
" you no got right to do dat , no ! "
" have n't i ? "
answered captain ponsberry , in a voice that cut like a whip .
" i 'd like to see anybody dispute over it .
<name> , <name> , do as i command . "
" yes , sir , " answered <name> , and ran off to get a pair of handcuffs while <name> grandon stationed himself beside ostag semmel , <unk> pin in hand .
" you no mak me a prisoner ! "
fumed the bearded sailor .
" you got no right ! "
he continued to rave , saying that it was a plot against him , because he had been the first to complain about the vile food served to the hands ; that he had not been near the galley and that the captain , grandon , and <name> knew it .
he even appealed to the other sailors to stand by him , and several came forward to argue with captain ponsberry .
but the master of the schooner was obstinate and would not listen .
" i know what i am doing , men , " he said , quickly but firmly .
" he is a scoundrel and a spell in the brig <name> do him good .
after this i reckon you 'll find the grub all right . "
" i no like  " began peterson , once more .
" you shut up , peterson , or i 'll put you in the brig with semmel , " cut in the captain , and peterson fell back with the rest , but with a brow that was dark and <unk> .
by this time <name> had returned with the handcuffs and despite the resistance he offered , ostag semmel was made a prisoner .
then the first and the second mates led him to the schooner 's brig ,  a narrow , <unk> room in the bow of the boat , usually used for storing lanterns and oil .
the smell in the closet  for it was nothing else  was far from pleasant , and a day in the brig usually made a prisoner repent and promise to do better .
" i mak trouble for dis ! "
growled semmel , as the door was closed and bolted on him .
" i mak trouble , yes !
you got no right to do dis , no ! "
" and you have n't any right to doctor the grub , " answered <name> , and then he and grandon walked away .
" that fellow is a first-class villain , to my way of reasoning , " was the first mate 's comment .
" i believe he 'd do almost anything to get square for this . "
after ostag semmel had been placed in the brig captain ponsberry called all hands to him once more and related what <name> and <name> had seen .
the stew was inspected , but nothing suspicious could be seen about it .
" if any of you want to try that stew you may do so , " said the captain .
" of course , if semmel did n't touch it there can be nothing in it that can hurt you . "
but all , even to peterson , declined to even taste the food .
it was one thing to think semmel innocent but quite another to run the risk of being made sick or poisoned .
in the end the stew was dumped overboard and <name> prepared an entirely new dinner for all hands .
" you must keep close watch on all of the men , " said the captain to <name> and grandon , when quietness had been restored .
" semmel was the worst of the lot , but i do not like the way peterson and one or two others are acting . "
" i do n't see what they can do , " answered <name> .
" they might start a mutiny , " came from the first mate .
" would they dare go as far as that ? "
" sometimes sailors get strange notions , and the old <name> himself can't stop them , " said captain ponsberry .
" a thing that in itself doesn't amount to much <name> start them off , and they 'll imagine that everything is going wrong .
when i was a lad , on board the <name> <name> , captain snapper , we had a mutiny just because the coffee was n't right . "
" yes , and i can remember that they had a mutiny on the old brig chesterfield because captain roe 's wife brought a <unk> yellow cat on board , " added grandon .
" not a man would hoist a sail until that <unk> was put ashore .
and when , two months later , the brig lost her foremast in a <name> , the sailors said it was on account of that same cat , she having scratched the mast before she was taken away ! "
" well , i <name> we do n't have a mutiny , " said <name> .
" i 'd like to suggest something , captain ponsberry , " he went on , to the master of the columbia .
" fire ahead , <name> . "
" you know we can trust <name> striker .
why not have him report just what the other hands are doing ? "
" that 's an idea , and i <name> act on it .
yes , i 'd trust striker as quick as i 'd trust you .
if there is to be trouble we certainly want to know of it as soon as possible , " concluded the captain .
chapter <name> the fight for the ship the day to follow was <name> , and contrary to expectations , it passed quietly .
as there was hardly any wind , the old columbia made slow progress , and the sailors had little or nothing to do .
as was his usual habit , <name> read his bible , and captain ponsberry held a short church service , which less than half the crew attended .
" it 's plain to see that the men are sulky , " said <name> grandon , towards evening .
" we are certain to hear something from them shortly . "
<name> had been told to report anything unusual , but it was not until after dark that he sought out captain ponsberry .
" i ai n't got much to say , " said the old tar .
" but to my mind peterson , <unk> , and shamhaven are doin ' a powerful lot of <unk> ' .
more'n that , i saw peterson cleaning up a pistol he 's got . "
" are any of the other hands armed ? "
" i ai n't seen no other <unk> , " answered <name> .
the captain had expected to interview semmel once more , but found the fellow so surly he gave up the attempt .
as the brig was so hot and uncomfortable , the master of the schooner had the door fixed so it could be left open several inches , with a chain at the bolt to keep it from going further .
at four o'clock monday morning peterson came on duty , followed by shamhaven and some others .
all made their way to the bow and began to talk in a low but <name> fashion .
then peterson went below , to where semmel was still confined in the brig .
" we are ready to move now , " said he , in russian .
" what do you think ? "
" let me out and i <name> show you what i think , " growled ostag semmel .
" the captain is a dog  and grandon and <name> are dogs , too ! "
peterson was prepared to unlock the chain which held the brig door and did so .
then he handed a pistol to the russian .
" the captain and <name> are in their staterooms , " said peterson .
" only grandon is on deck , with <name> and with the men we can trust to help us . "
" we ca n't trust <name> . "
" i know that . "
" where is striker ? "
" asleep in his berth . "
but on this score <name> peterson was mistaken .
<name> had pretended to go to sleep , but he was now in a corner on deck , watching with keen eyes all that was occurring .
presently he saw semmel in company with peterson hurry towards the bow , and he felt that the time for action had arrived .
" hi , mr .
grandon ! "
he called out , running up to the first mate .
" what is it , striker ? "
" they 've released semmel and they are arming themselves . "
" you do n't say ! "
<name> grandon was stunned for the instant .
" tell the captain and <name> of this at once ! "
" aye , aye , sir ! "
rushing down the companionway , <name> entered the cabin and knocked on the door of captain ponsberry 's stateroom .
" wake up , captain ! "
he called , loudly .
" wake up !
there is going to be trouble putty quick , to my way o ' thinkin ' ! "
" what has gone wrong now ? "
demanded the master of the columbia , as he hurried into his clothes and armed himself .
" where is grandon ? "
" on deck ; he sent me to tell you .
they have set semmel free and some of 'em are arming themselves . "
" a mutiny ! "
roared captain ponsberry .
" striker , you 'll stand by me , of course ? "
" that i <name> , sir  to the end . "
" good .
i know <name> <name> do the same .
do you know anything about the others ? "
" i think you can count on <name> the cook . "
" what of <name> ? "
" he 's so <unk> i do n't know what he 'll do , " answered striker .
by this time <name> was out of his stateroom .
with his door ajar he had heard all that had been said .
" oh , <name> , do you think they 'll try to seize the ship ? "
he gasped .
" do n't know what they 'll do .
they 're a plumb crazy lot , " growled the old tar .
" it was a mistake to take such fellers as semmel and peterson and shamhaven aboard . "
" that is true , but when <unk> and larson got sick and went to the hospital at manila i had to get somebody , " answered captain ponsberry .
he brought out several pistols .
" here , <name> , take one of these , and a cutlass , too , and you , striker , can arm yourself likewise . "
there was no time to answer , for the master of the schooner was already striding through the cabin in the direction of the companionway .
an instant later came a yell from the deck , followed by heavy footsteps and then the report of a pistol .
" drive dem to de cabin ! "
came in the voice of semmel .
" drive dem along , kvick ! "
and then followed another yell and the sounds of half a dozen blows .
" below there ! "
came in <name> grandon 's voice .
" help !
help ! "
" i 'm coming ! "
called up captain ponsberry .
" do n't you dare to step on deck , captain ! "
yelled down the voice of shamhaven .
" do n't you dare to do it ! "
and the sailor appeared , pistol in hand , at the top of the companionway .
" shamhaven , what does this mean ? "
demanded the master of the columbia .
" it means that we have taken possession of the ship , that 's what it means , " came from <unk> .
" of you come up here , you maybe git killed , " put in ostag semmel .
" you stay down dare , you hear ? "
and then , as the captain started to mount the stairs , he threw down a <unk> pin .
in the semi-darkness the captain did not see the object , and it struck him on the top of the head , rendering him partly unconscious .
<name> and <name> were close behind their leader and both were alarmed to see him go down , uttering a deep groan as he did so .
" is he killed ? "
questioned the young second mate .
" i do n't know , " was the old tar 's response .
" shall we go up ? "
" keep back there ! "
was the call from above .
" put a step on those stairs and it <name> be the worse for you ! "
at that moment came a cry from cal <name> .
the boatswain had been attacked from behind and was given no chance to defend himself .
then came a roar from <name> , who came rushing toward the companionway as if all the demons of the deep were behind him .
" <unk> me !
<unk> me ! "
he screamed .
" da is gwine to pirate de ship !
<unk> me ! "
and then he came plunging down headlong , directly on top of <name> , <name> , and the prostrate captain .
this unexpected coming of <name> sent the young second mate and the old tar flat on captain ponsberry , and for the moment there was a struggle all around .
in the meantime some sailors on the deck began to drag a heavy hatch toward the stairs .
soon this was placed in position , and then those below were virtually prisoners .
" oh my , <unk> me ! "
groaned <name> once more , as he managed to get on his feet in the cabin , followed by <name> and <name> .
" do n't you let dem swing me from de <unk> ! "
" <name> , where are grandon and <name> ? "
demanded <name> .
" i dunno , sah  dead , i guess , " answered the cook .
" oh , dis am de <unk> <unk> wot i <unk> heard tell ob ! "
he added , <unk> , and wrung his hands .
the lantern in the cabin was turned up and <name> gave his attention once more to captain ponsberry , who was now opening his eyes .
" oh , my head ! "
came with a shiver .
" my head ! "
" i 'm glad they did n't kill you , " said <name> , kindly .
" <name> , help me <name> him into the cabin .
we 'll put him on the couch . "
this was done , and they did what they could to make the master of the schooner comfortable .
but it was a good half-hour before captain ponsberry could sit up and do any rational thinking .
on deck all had become suddenly quiet .
occasionally those below could hear a footstep near the companionway , showing that one or more of the mutineers were on guard .
the hatch shut off the view on deck , and the windows in the ceiling of the cabin were also boarded over from the outside .
" they have us like rats in a trap , " said <name> , bitterly .
" and for all we know <name> and grandon are both dead , " returned <name> striker , soberly .
" i must say , lad , we seem to be in a bad way and no mistake . "
" dey 'll throw us overboard , i know dey <name> ! "
groaned <name> , who was almost white with terror .
" i <unk> see sech <unk> in all <name> life ! "
to fight the mutineers further was , just then , out of the question , and <name> turned his attention again to captain ponsberry .
at last the captain seemed fully to comprehend what had occurred .
he once more moved toward the companionway , pistol in hand .
" you ca n't get out that way , sir , " said <name> .
" they have placed the fore hatch over the stairs . "
" and they are armed , too , " put in <name> .
" be careful , sir , or they'll shoot you down . "
" and this on my own ship ! "
came bitterly from the master of the columbia .
" that is what i get for treating the dogs better than they deserve .
where are grandon and <name> ? "
" either shot down or taken prisoners .
they called for help , and that was the last we heard of them . "
" and are all the others in this dastardly plot ? "
" i reckon they are , " answered <name> .
" them foreigners , semmel an' peterson , must have stirred 'em up powerfully . "
still weak from the blow received , captain ponsberry sank down once more on the cabin couch .
there was a lump as big as a walnut on the top of his head , and he had <name> bathe it with water and then with <unk> , which made it a trifle more comfortable .
a short while later came a sudden wild song from the deck of the schooner , followed by a <unk> of glasses .
" they are treating themselves to <unk> , " said <name> .
" i suppose , now they have the run of things , they 'll drink all they want of the stuff . "
" more than likely , " returned the captain .
" well , it is their turn just now  perhaps before long it <name> be my turn ! "
and he smiled significantly .
chapter vii the mutineers in possession as my old readers know , both captain ponsberry and <name> striker were yankees to the backbone , and it galled them exceedingly to see the schooner in the hands of a number of mutineers , and especially foreigners .
" we 've got to git the ship back , no two ways on it , " growled the old tar .
" captain , i 'm willin ' to fight to the end , if ye give the word . "
" and i 'll fight , too , " said <name> , promptly .
" do n't you go fo ' to fight dem <unk> ! "
whined <name> .
" yo ' <name> all be killed suah ! "
" i would like to know what has become of grandon and <name> , " came from captain ponsberry .
" as we stand now , we are but four to seven or eight .
if we could get grandon and <name> to aid us we would be six against them . "
" perhaps all the hands are not in the mutiny , " suggested <name> .
" why not try to sound them ? "
" i was thinking of doing that . "
a little later captain ponsberry called up the companionway .
at first nobody paid any attention to him , but presently the hatch was shoved aside a few inches and ostag semmel looked down .
behind him was shamhaven .
" semmel , what does this mean ? "
asked the captain , as calmly as he could .
" it means dat ve haf de ship , " replied the russian , with a grin .
" you are carrying matters with a very high hand .
where are grandon and <name> ? "
" i not tell you dat . "
" we had a right to mutiny , " said shamhaven .
" the grub was n't fit to eat and was getting worse every day . "
" that 's a tale gotten up for the occasion , shamhaven , and you know it .
semmel doctored the food to make you dissatisfied . "
" well , we do n't think so , " grumbled the sailor .
" i do n't think so , and <unk> and the others do n't either . "
" has <name> <name> joined you ? "
" certainly he has , " was shamhaven 's ready reply , but his look belied his words .
" ve are all <unk> to stick <unk> , " said semmel .
" you might as vell gif up  der sooner der <unk> for you ! "
" i do n't propose to give up , you rascal . "
" to n't you call me a rascals , no ! "
shouted ostag semmel .
" i vos now der captains , yes , do you hear ?
captain semmel ! "
" bosh ! "
put in <name> striker , in disgust .
" why ye ai n't fit to be the skipper <unk> a <unk> ! "
" if you try to navigate the ship you 'll sink her on the rocks , " put in <name> .
" you had better consider what you are doing , shamhaven , " went on the master of the columbia .
" remember , if i regain possession of the schooner i can make it go hard with you . "
" you no get dare schooner again , not much ! "
came from peterson , who had just come up , followed by <name> <name> .
" <name> , are you in this ? "
demanded the captain .
" if you are , i must confess i did n't think it of you . "
" i ai n't goin ' to eat poor grub , " answered <name> , lamely .
" the grub is all right and you know it .
it was doctored up by semmel , and i   " " you stop dat talk ! "
roared semmel , and then he added : " maybe you gif in after you are goot an ' hungry , hey ? "
" what , do you want to starve us out ? "
cried <name> .
" you see  chust <unk> ! "
answered the russian , and with this the hatch was again put in place and the conference came to an end .
captain ponsberry was fairly boiling with wrath , but even so he realized that <name> is often the better part of valor .
" there is no use of trying a rush to the deck , " he said .
" those rascals would surely shoot us down .
just now some of them are in the humor for anything . "
" perhaps we can do something to-night , " suggested <name> .
" they talk about starving us out , " said <name> .
" ai n't there nothin ' to eat here ? "
an inspection was made of the cabin pantry , which brought to light some preserves , some pickles , a pot of cheese , and a tin of fancy crackers .
" about enough for one meal , " said captain ponsberry , grimly .
" and a pretty slim one at that , " added <name> .
" but i say , captain , " he added , suddenly , " is n't there a door leading from the back of the pantry down into the hold ? "
" there was once  but i had it nailed up years ago , for we never used it . "
" if we can open that , we might get something from the hold . "
" going to eat machinery ? "
demanded <name> .
" no  canned goods , <name> ; i know <name> had some placed there , for he did n't have room in his <unk> . "
" dat am a <unk> ' , " put in the cook .
" i'se got lots ob <unk> in dat dar hold . "
" then that settles the starving question , " said captain ponsberry .
" i've got a small saw and a hammer down here somewhere .
we can use them on the door . "
" and that gives me another idea , " went on <name> .
" the hatch covering over the companionway belongs to the fore hatch .
if we can reach that opening from here , why ca n't we steal on deck when we get the chance and try to make the mutineers prisoners ? "
" eureka ! "
shouted <name> .
" that 's the talk , <name> .
fer your years you've got a wonderfully long head on ye .
we 'll make 'em prisoners or <name> 'em overboard ! "
" the idea is worth considering , " said the captain .
" but we must be careful . "
a search was made and the hammer , small saw , and also a chisel were found .
then they cleaned out the pantry , took down several shelves , and thus uncovered the small door which had been nailed up .
" do n't make any noise , or they 'll suspect that we are up to something , " said captain ponsberry .
" let <name> rattle some dishes , " said <name> , and while he and <name> worked on the door , the cook began to handle the dishes in such a rough manner that several were broken .
he also tried to sing a couple of verses of his favorite song , " my gal <name> ! "
but his voice was so shaky that the effort was , artistically , a failure , although it added to the noise , which was all that was desired .
" they 're pretty happy down there , " said <name> to shamhaven , as he listened to the sounds .
" oh , they 're putting on a front , " growled shamhaven .
" they 'll sing a different tune when their stomachs are empty . "
" i do n't know about this mutiny , " went on the <unk> sailor , nervously .
" oh , it 's all right and you need n't to worry , <name> .
if we stick together we 'll make a couple of thousand apiece out of this game . "
" but what shall we do if we fall in with a russian warship ? "
" semmel has that all fixed .
he 'll expose the captain and state that the columbia is carrying a cargo for the japanese government , and that he took possession in the name of the czar .
with this war on they wo n't ask too many questions so long as they can give the japs a black eye . "
" i see .
but supposing we fall in with a japanese warship ? "
" then semmel is going to turn the command over to me and i 'll tell them that the cargo was really meant for the japanese government but that captain ponsberry , just before we left manila , sold out to the russian agents and was going to <unk> .
i 'll add that we refused to go to the russian port after signing for nagasaki , and all of the men can back me up .
that <name> put the captain and his friends in <unk> and give us some prize money .
oh , we 'll come out ahead , do n't you worry , " concluded shamhaven , confidently .
the day passed slowly and the mutineers held several meetings , to settle upon just what they were going to do .
but all had been drinking more than was good for them and the conferences ended in nothing but talk .
semmel was the accepted leader , but it was plain to see that shamhaven objected strongly to playing a secondary part , and peterson also wanted a large " finger in the pie . "
as they worked with care , it was a good hour and a half before <name> and <name> managed to take down the door leading into the hold .
even when this was done they found on the other side several heavy cases of machinery almost impossible to budge .
" we can pry those out of the way , " said the captain .
" a foot or so <name> do it , " returned <name> .
" then i think i can crawl over the top . "
they continued the work , and a little later the young second mate was able to squeeze his way to the top of the cargo in that vicinity .
" be careful , <name> , " warned the captain .
" if a case should shift with the ship you might get a crushed leg .
you had better take a candle along . "
" i <name> , sir . "
<name> was as anxious to get into the hold as the young second mate , and he too squeezed his tall , lank form through the opening .
guided by the faint light of the candle , they crawled over a number of cases of machinery and war goods until they <name> close to the middle of the ship .
" here we are ! "
cried <name> , in a low voice , and pointed to some cases of canned goods .
" beans , corn , tomatoes , salt pork , condensed milk  we wo n't starve just yet , <name> . "
" an ' here are some barrels o ' flour , " added the old tar .
" no , they can't starve us nohow now . "
they had brought the chisel and hammer along , and with extra caution opened some of the cases .
taking with them all the goods they could <name> , they returned to the cabin .
" this is splendid ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" with this stuff on hand we can hold the cabin indefinitely . "
" how is i gwine to cook ? "
questioned <name> .
" over the two lanterns , <name> .
it <name> be slow work , but our time is our own .
luckily there are pots and tins in the pantry . "
" all right , sah . "
" of course , i am hoping that we shall not have to stay here long , " went on the captain .
" but it is best to be prepared . "
that those on deck might not see the cooking going on , one of the staterooms was cleaned out and <name> went to work in this .
in the meantime semmel called down the companionway once more .
" are you gettin ' hungry ? "
he asked .
" tell him yes , " whispered <name> .
" why ? "
questioned the captain , in an equally low tone .
" then he 'll think we are getting ready to come to terms and he won't watch us so closely . "
" i see . "
captain ponsberry raised his voice .
" yes , we are hungry , " he called up .
" what are you going to send us , something good ? "
" ve send noddings .
maybe you talk business soon , hey ? "
continued the rascally russian .
" perhaps . "
" how soon ? "
" well , perhaps to-morrow morning . "
" not before <name> , hey ? "
" no . "
" all right den ; you can go on an ' starve so long ! "
growled ostag semmel , and went away .
a moment later he met shamhaven .
" what did he say ? "
asked the latter , anxiously .
" he comes to terms to-morrow ! "
answered the russian , triumphantly .
chapter viii turning the tables the meal which <name> prepared put all in the cabin in better humor , and as soon as it was over a council of war was held .
it was decided to wait until darkness had set in , and then try to gain the deck of the ship by way of the fore hatch .
in the meantime the door to the companionway was to be locked and barred , so that the mutineers could not attack them very well from that direction , should a running fight ensue .
as <name> would be of no use in a struggle he was delegated to remain in the cabin , to make as much noise as possible , singing and talking to himself , so that the mutineers might not suspect what was taking place .
each member of the party armed himself both with a pistol and a cutlass , and <name> led the way as before , candle in hand .
it was easy for <name> to follow him , but rather difficult for the captain , who was more portly .
" reckon as how ye should n't have eaten so much , captain , " chuckled the old tar , as he helped captain ponsberry through a particularly narrow place .
" true , striker , " was the answer .
" but you be careful that you do n't slip into some slit between the cases and go out of sight . "
they soon gained the spot where the canned goods had been found .
they had now to climb over some machinery that reached nearly to the top of the hold , and then over a varied collection of boxes and barrels and bags .
on the bags lay some of the old sails of the ship and several coils of discarded rope .
they were just approaching the open fore hatch when they saw a rope ladder let down .
instantly <name> uttered a warning and put out the light .
" somebody is coming down , " he whispered .
it was the sailor <name> , who had been sent to get some canned goods for cooking purposes .
he came down the rope ladder with a lantern slung over one arm .
" we 'll make him a prisoner ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" and let us do it as quietly as we can , so as not to disturb those on deck . "
the others understood and crouched back in the darkness .
then , as <name> passed them , the captain caught him from the back and <name> clapped a hand over the fellow 's mouth .
" oh ! "
spluttered <name> , but that was as far as he got .
" not a word !
not a sound , <name> ! "
said captain ponsberry , earnestly .
the sailor understood , and being a craven at heart he almost collapsed .
it was an easy matter to take one of the old ropes and tie his hands behind him .
then captain ponsberry confronted the mutineer , making a liberal exhibition of his pistol as he did so .
" <name> , answer me truthfully , " said the master of the columbia .
" are you all in this mutiny or not ?
do n't speak above a whisper . "
" i ai n't in it ! "
whined <name> .
" they dragged me in , they did .
i ain't kicking about grub , or nothing ! "
" are all the others in it ? "
" kind of , yes .
<unk> did n't care much to go in .
guess he wish he was out of it now . "
" what has become of grandon and <name> ? "
" both of 'em are prisoners in the brig . "
" are they wounded ? "
" not much .
grandon had his thumb cut and <name> got a kick in the back that lamed him . "
" is anybody guarding them ? "
" i guess not .
all of 'em have got to drinking again .
say , captain , let me out of this fix and i 'll never go against you again , never , " continued <name> , earnestly .
" we 'll see about that later , " was the grim reply .
" captain ponsberry , i have a scheme , " put in <name> , and he <name> the master of the ship to one side .
" <name> is about the same build as myself .
let me take his coat and cap and go on deck and down to the brig .
if i can release grandon and <name> we 'll be sure to knock out the mutiny in no time . "
" it 's a dangerous game , <name> . "
" oh , please let me do it ! "
pleaded the young second mate .
the hazard was one which appealed to him strongly .
the matter was talked over for a few minutes and it was decided to let <name> have his way .
<name> was soon stripped of his coat and the young second mate donned the garment .
then he took the mutineer 's cap and pulled it as far over his brow as possible and turned up the coat collar .
" i 'll leave the lantern here , " he said , and a second later was mounting the rope ladder slowly and cautiously .
with his head on a level with the deck <name> paused to reconnoiter the situation .
he knew exactly how dangerous his mission was and that he was running the risk of being shot .
but his life in our navy had made him bold , and seeing nobody in sight , he leaped out on deck , and hurried with all speed to the ladder leading to the brig .
soon he was in front of the barred door .
" grandon !
<name> ! "
he called , softly .
" hullo , who 's that ? "
came in the voice of the first mate .
" it is i , <name> .
is <name> there ? "
" yes .
where did you come from ? "
" the cabin . "
<name> <unk> the door .
" are you hurt ? "
" not much .
how are you ? "
" i am all right , and so are the captain and <name> striker .
they are in the hold , ready to come on deck .
we have made <name> a prisoner . "
" good enough , " came from the boatswain .
" the rascals !
they ought all to walk the plank ! "
he added , vehemently .
the two men had their hands tied behind them , but it was an easy matter for <name> to liberate them .
then each provided himself with a <unk> pin , and all three of the party stole to the deck .
from the forecastle and the cook 's galley came loud talking , showing that the mutineers were making themselves at home .
one man was trying to do some cooking .
" what 's keeping <name> so long ? "
he demanded of the others .
nobody knew , and one of the crowd , the sailor named <unk> , volunteered to look the missing one up .
" let us follow him to the hatch , " whispered <name> .
" perhaps we can make him a prisoner . "
" right you are , " answered <name> grandon .
with caution they came up behind the man , and just as <unk> leaned over the open hatchway , they caught him tightly .
" keep silent , <unk> ! "
said grandon .
" keep silent , or we 'll throw you overboard . "
" stop ! "
roared the mutineer .
" help !
<unk>   " he got no further , for raising his <unk> pin , <name> brought it down on the mutineer 's head .
<unk> had been the one to lame the <unk> back and the latter had not forgotten it .
over went the fellow and sank down as if dead .
" drop him into the hold , " ordered grandon , and this was done just as captain ponsberry and <name> striker appeared at the foot of the rope ladder .
" another , eh ? "
said the master of the columbia .
" good enough !
how are you , <name> ?
how are you , <name> ? "
" we 're ready to fight 'em , " answered the first mate .
" come on !
they've got so much liquor aboard they ca n't do much to us ! "
" be careful , i do n't want anybody shot if it can be avoided , " responded captain ponsberry .
" i think it would be a good plan to dump them all into the hold , " said <name> .
" then we could nail up that pantry door , put the hatch into place , and keep them at our <name> . "
" if the plan <name> work , it 's a good one , " answered the captain .
one after another they came out on deck , leaving <name> and <unk> in the hold .
they found the mutineers equally divided between the galley and the forecastle .
the only man in charge of the schooner was conroy , who was at the wheel .
as they advanced upon the forecastle they saw semmel come out , accompanied by peterson .
" there are the <unk> ! "
cried captain ponsberry , and rushing up to them he exclaimed : " surrender , you rascals ! "
and he aimed his pistol , while the others also raised their weapons .
the russian and his companion were taken completely by surprise , and before they could draw any weapons of their own it was too late .
grandon tripped one up and fell upon him , and then <name> and <name> tripped up the other .
there was a brief scuffle , the exchange of several blows which did little damage , and in a trice semmel and peterson were thrown down into the hold bodily , and the ladder was hauled up out of their reach .
" put that hatch over the opening , " cried captain ponsberry to <name> .
" and then go into the cabin pantry and nail up that door .
be quick about it , or they may get out ! "
" aye , aye , sir ! "
cried the young second mate , and ran off with all speed .
the hatch was large and heavy , but the excitement lent him strength and he dragged it forward and threw it over the hatchway .
" stop dat ! "
roared semmel , in a drunken voice , but <name> paid no attention .
his next movement was toward the cabin .
" do n't yo ' tech me ! "
roared <name> , in alarm .
" oh , it am yo ' ! "
he added , as he recognized <name> .
" how am de battle gwine ? "
" we 've got 'em on the run  four are prisoners in the hold , " was <unk> reply .
" get me that box of nails , <name>  i must put that door back as it was ! "
" yes , sah ; yes , sah ! "
answered the cook , eagerly , and brought forth the nails in question .
then he helped to put the door into place , and held it while <name> nailed the barrier .
the job was just completed when the young second mate heard voices from the hold .
" hi , dare , you let us out , " came from peterson .
" ve vill mak it right , yes ! "
" you keep quiet , " ordered <name> , and would say no more .
against the door he and <name> placed several trunks and boxes taken from the staterooms opening off of the cabin .
during this time the party led by captain ponsberry had attacked the balance of the mutineers .
there was a brief fight and shamhaven got a cutlass cut on the knee .
but then the men surrendered , and one after another was made to drop down into the hold , and the hatch was shut and <unk> down .
the only man who was not thus made a prisoner was conroy , who begged at once to be forgiven .
" they got me to drink , captain , " he pleaded .
" i did n't know what i was doing .
forgive it , and i 'll be the best man you ever had on board . "
" can i depend upon you , conroy ? "
asked captain ponsberry , sternly .
" you can , sir  i give you my word on it . "
" you wo n't try to help the mutineers ? "
" no , sir ; no , sir ! "
" very well then , i 'll try you .
but , remember , if you try any dirty work it <name> go hard with you .
now tell me , was <name> in favor of this mutiny ? "
" no , sir , he was not .
semmel forced him into it . "
" what of the others .
who were the <unk> ? "
" semmel and peterson and shamhaven .
the others did n't want to do anything but complain about the grub , " answered conroy , and then told the particulars of the mutiny from beginning to end .
chapter ix close to a <unk> it was decided to leave the mutineers in the hold undisturbed until morning .
this done , those who had been hurt in the scrimmage had their wounds attended to , and then <name> was set to work to prepare a good meal for all the loyal party .
the galley was in a state of disorder , but this counted for nothing , and <name> soon had matters straightened out .
after so much excitement nobody thought of retiring .
<name> was stationed over the fore hatch , to give warning of any attempt on the part of the mutineers to regain their <name> .
he was armed and he threatened to " blow the hull head off " of anybody who dared to show himself or make a noise .
as a consequence the mutineers did nothing .
two made their way to the <unk> door , but finding they could not open it , gave up the attempt as a bad job .
as a punishment for his misdeeds conroy was kept at the wheel during the whole of the night .
he was willing enough to do the extra work if only the captain would forgive him for his actions .
the master of the ship questioned him closely , and in the end reached the conclusion that only semmel , peterson , and shamhaven were the leaders in the attempt to seize the ship and that the others had followed after them like so many sheep .
" i am glad to hear this , " he said to grandon and <name> .
" i think after i read them a strong lecture they 'll behave themselves . "
" but we shall have to watch 'em closely , " said the first mate .
" what <name> you do with semmel , peterson , and shamhaven ? "
asked <name> .
" put them in irons and keep them there until the end of the trip .
when we reach nagasaki they can take their choice of leaving or of being kicked off the ship .
if they raise a row i 'll hand them over to the authorities . "
" you ought to have them locked up . "
" true , lad ; but with this war on hand the courts wo n't want to bother with such a case . "
it was not until nine o'clock in the morning that captain ponsberry had the forward hatch raised once more .
those below were almost dying for fresh air and water .
" i want <name> to come up , " he said .
" ca n't we have some water ? "
demanded shamhaven .
" yes , if you 'll behave yourselves , " was the short answer .
there was a babble of voices , but the master of the ship paid no attention .
each man who had been thrown below was unarmed , so there was no danger of any shooting .
presently <name> came up the rope ladder thrown to him , looking sheepish enough .
" what have you to say for yourself ? "
demanded the captain , when <name> threw himself on his knees .
" do n't count it against me , cap ' ! "
he groaned .
" i did n't want to go into it , i tell you !
i did n't want to go in ! "
" if i forgive you , <name> you give me your word to behave yourself ? "
" yes , sir ! "
" you wo n't do any more underhanded work ? "
" you can shoot me if i do , captain . "
" very well ; i 'll remember that .
now go forward and help put the ship in good order .
<name> , set him to work , and see that he does just what you tell him . "
and <name> went off , with the young second mate following , thanking his stars that he had not been swung to the <unk> , for mutiny on the high seas is a capital offense .
one by one the mutineers were allowed to come on deck , until only semmel , peterson , and shamhaven remained below .
those to come up pleaded to be forgiven and promised to obey orders in the future and let the captain run the ship to suit himself .
during the night , <unk> had had a bitter quarrel with semmel , and the russian appeared presently with a black eye and two of his front teeth loose .
he was promptly put in irons , and the <unk> of peterson and shamhaven followed .
" i have allowed the other men their <name> because you three led them into this affair , " said captain ponsberry to the trio of rascals .
" i intend to keep you in irons until the end of the trip . "
at this there was a loud complaint , and the three made all manner of protestations , but the master of the columbia was obdurate , and at last threatened to throw them into the hold again .
this quieted them for the time being , and after being given a square meal and a drink of water , they were marched off to the brig , which was cleaned of everything else for their accommodation .
fortunately for the columbia the weather remained fair , so that the loss of the prisoners was not felt when it came to handling the schooner .
those who had <unk> were only too glad to get back into captain ponsberry 's good graces and they did whatever was required with an alacrity which was as astonishing as it was gratifying .
they ate whatever was set before them , and soon reached the conclusion that the food was really better than they deserved .
" we were fools to follow semmel , " said <name> ; and conroy and some others fully agreed with him .
but though it now looked as if the men could be trusted , captain ponsberry determined to keep his eyes on them .
<name> was placed at the head of one watch and <name> at the head of the other , so that , with one or the other of the mates , the deck was always guarded by at least two persons that could be depended upon .
the captain had hoped for favorable breezes following the heavy storm , but these did not come , and day after day passed with the old columbia making slow progress toward nagasaki .
<unk> was passed during a bit of thick weather , so that nothing was seen of that island .
then the sun came out again , hotter than ever , so that <name> was glad to keep in the shade as much as possible .
" it 's not so exciting as it was a few days ago , " remarked <name> to <name> one day , when both were seated in the shade of the forecastle .
" i am glad that mutiny is at an end , " answered <name> .
" it 's a great wonder that somebody was n't killed or seriously wounded . "
" the men did n't have their hearts in the <unk> , thet 's why , <name> .
if they had really meant business  well , i reckon some of us would n't be here now to tell the tale . "
" i think semmel meant business . "
" yes , he 's a heap sight worse nor any o ' the others . "
" it was a mistake to take him on board .
i tell you , a captain ca n't be too careful who he puts in his forecastle . "
" well , you know the reason  those other hands gettin ' sick at manila .
but i can tell you , i 'd rather have a crew of americans any day . "
" they are hard to get . "
" true fer you . "
the old yankee tar heaved a sigh .
" the old days are gone , sure enough .
my !
my !
what times we used to have , when we 'd go out , every man <unk> ' every other man on the ship , an ' all about him , too !
then it was like a big family settin ' sail .
now , if you go on a new ship ye do n't know nobody an ' nobody knows nobody else . "
" i guess you expect to live and die a sailor , do n't you , <name> ? "
" do n't know but what i do , unless somebody leaves me money enough to live like a millionaire , " and the old tar grinned .
day after day passed and the columbia kept on her course , making as straight a passage for nagasaki as possible .
one day there would be a fair breeze and the next a dead calm .
" this is unusual weather for this quarter of the globe , " said captain ponsberry to <name> .
" like as not it <name> end in another hurricane . "
" in that case what <name> you do , release semmel and the others ? "
" i may release peterson and shamhaven , but not semmel , for he was the real ringleader . "
there were strong signs of a storm in the air that night , but they brought forth nothing , and on the following morning the sun came up as full and bright as before .
the breeze came by fits and starts , from first one direction and then another , and the man at the wheel had all he could do to keep the schooner to her course .
sails were shifted half a dozen times , but without making any improvement .
" the weather is certainly queer , " said grandon .
" puts me in mind of the time i was caught in a tidal wave in the south seas .
before the wave struck us we had just such <unk> . "
" i trust we do n't strike a tidal wave , " answered <name> .
" if it was high enough it might swamp us . "
" true ; but when you 're on the deep blue sea , lad , you 've got to take whatever comes , " replied the first mate , solemnly .
dinner was a quiet affair for all on board , and shortly after the repast <name> went to the forward deck , to have another chat with <name> .
while the two were talking they were joined by captain ponsberry ; and soon the three were conversing about old times once more .
" do you remember the swim we once took in the pacific ? "
said <name> to <name> .
" the time the <unk> smashed the boat and came after us ? "
" reckon i do , " was the yankee tar 's response .
" we had a lively swim fer it , did n't we ? "
" and the time we visited the island and you turned the turtles ? "
went on <name> .
" and do you remember that snake that chased us into the water ? "
" i do , <name> .
tell you what , we 've had our share of adventures .
when admiral <name>   what is it , captain ? "
<name> broke off short and looked at captain ponsberry inquiringly .
the master of the columbia was gazing over the port bow in an <name> , puzzled fashion .
" do you see that little black cloud , striker ? "
" i do , sir ! "
and now <name> became all attention and so did <name> .
" kind o ' funny lookin ' , ai n't it ? "
" it is odd , " answered the captain .
" do you see how it seems to be dancing around in the sky ? "
" is it a cloud ? "
questioned <name> .
" if so , i never saw its like before . "
" i 'll take a look at it through my glass , " went on the captain , and sent a sailor for the article .
the cloud came swiftly closer and they heard a most unusual roaring and hissing .
then of a sudden the cloud seemed to dip down into the sea .
when it came up , the waters of the ocean followed , and there loomed up before those on the ship a <unk> ten or fifteen feet thick .
" a <unk> ! "
cried half a dozen in concert .
" and a mighty powerful one , too , " said the captain .
" i trust it don't come this way . "
" it is coming this way ! "
yelled <name> .
" look !
look ! "
the young second mate was right , the <unk> appeared to be headed directly for the schooner .
but then it shot off to the westward , churning the water into a foam behind it .
" it 's going away , " murmured <name> , when once more the <unk> made a curve and then shot directly toward them .
it was off the port bow and less than a hundred feet away .
it looked as if the old columbia was surely doomed !
chapter x something about war and fighting ships " it 's going to strike the ship ! "
" it <name> cut us to pieces ! "
" throw the schooner over on the other tack ! "
these and several other cries rang out on the deck of the columbia .
all felt their hearts come up into their throats as the roaring , swirling mass of water came closer and closer , until the spray drenched them completely .
the ocean was <unk> into a white foam and the wind seemed to suck and blow in all directions at once .
but , just as it looked as if the schooner would be buried beneath a veritable mountain of water , the <unk> took another curve and slid away , along the side of the ship and off the stern .
the man at the wheel came close to being carried overboard by the deluge he received and the columbia bobbed up and down like a cork .
but in another moment the <unk> was an eighth of a mile distant .
" what a  a narrow escape , " faltered <name> , when he felt able to speak .
" i thought we were bound for the bottom sure ! "
" thet 's the closest i ever was to any <unk> , " came from <name> , as he wiped his wet brow .
" reckon we can thank providence we ai n't in davy jones ' locker this minit ! "
captain ponsberry did not say much , but kept his eyes fixed on the <unk> , which was making fantastic curves across the bosom of the pacific .
at times it was close by and then it would go half a mile or more away .
it was a fascinating scene , full of dread , and gave more than one <unk> a chill down his backbone .
" i wish it would go away completely , " went on <name> .
but this was not to be .
the <unk> kept within sight for a good half-hour , although it did not come near them again .
at last it grew less and less , off to the <unk> , and finally vanished altogether .
the glass was used in that direction , but nothing save a clear horizon could be located .
" we are clear of it at last , " said captain ponsberry , and breathed a long sigh of relief .
" <unk> are mighty dangerous things , " said grandon , after the scare was over .
" when i was on board of the brig <name> <name> we ran into a spout off the coast of brazil , and it knocked off the bow and the forward rail and nearly sank us . "
" i met one once , off the coast of cuba , " said the captain .
" that went ashore and tore up the trees like so many weeds for a hundred feet around .
a <unk> is nothing to be fooled with , i can tell you . "
on the day following the appearance of the <unk> the weather changed .
there was a slight storm and then a stiff breeze sprang up which was cheering to all on board .
every stitch of canvas on the columbia was spread and the schooner bowled along right merrily .
" i 'd like to know how this war is going on , and how <name> and <name> are faring , " said <name> to captain ponsberry .
" a whole lot may have happened since we left manila . "
" well , you 'll probably get word from your brother when you reach nagasaki , lad ; and we 'll get word from captain pennington , too . "
" i <name> neither of them has been wounded . "
" so do i ; but when one goes to the front he has got to put up with the fortunes of war .
being a soldier of fortune , as it is called , is no baby business . "
" do you suppose the japs are continuing to bombard port <name> ? "
" more than likely  if the place has n't fallen into their hands .
they want to make sure of their footing in lower <unk> , and they can never do that so long as the russians hold a single seaport down there . "
" i suppose russia has a pretty good-sized navy as well as an army ? "
" yes , <name> , one of the largest navies in the world .
but their fighting ships are no better than the ships of japan .
you see , the japanese navy is not near as old as the navy of russia .
almost all of the ships are of the up-to-date types .
most of them have been built since the war between japan and <name> in <unk> and 1895 . "
" that would make them only about ten years old . "
" exactly , and i 've been told that some of the ships in the russian navy are twenty and thirty years old .
more than this , all of the japanese guns are of the latest pattern  just as they are on our new warships . "
" i 'd like to go aboard of a japanese warship , " cried the young second mate , enthusiastically .
" want to see if it 's as good as it was aboard of the <name> , eh ? "
" yes , sir .
of course the <name> was old , especially alongside of the brooklyn , on which my brother <name> served in cuban waters , but even so she was a <unk> fighting machine .
if she had n't been she wouldn't have done her share in sinking that spanish fleet in manila bay . "
" well , you may have a chance to go aboard of a japanese ship while we stop at nagasaki .
there must be a number of them at that port , <unk> up and taking war supplies aboard . "
" how long do you think it <name> be before we reach that port ? "
" that <name> depend entirely upon the wind , as you know .
if we get just what we need we may reach there inside of four or five days , " answered captain ponsberry .
as peterson and shamhaven were now behaving themselves they were allowed to come out of the brig and do some work on the deck every morning and afternoon .
both begged the captain to forgive them , but the master of the columbia would promise nothing .
" you went into this with your eyes wide open , " he said .
" now you can line up and take your medicine . "
semmel was exceedingly bitter at not being allowed his <name> for at least a few hours a day and said he would denounce the captain at the first opportunity .
but captain ponsberry soon cut him short .
" you keep a civil tongue in your head , " he said , sternly .
" unless you do , i 'll put you down on <unk> and water . "
and thereupon semmel became sullenly silent .
towards evening of the day upon which <name> had the conversation about warships with captain ponsberry a chinese junk , heavily laden with <unk> boxes , was passed .
nobody on board could speak english , so the hail that was sent over the water brought no results .
" we are getting closer to the coast shipping , " said the master of the columbia .
" i suppose we 'll meet quite a few vessels from now on . "
during the night an unexpected <name> came up and the schooner was blown far out of her course .
the <name> came from the westward , so the vessel was blown to the east .
" this <name> make the trip a day or two longer , " grumbled grandon , after the <name> had spent itself .
" yes , but as we did n't lose a spar or a rag of canvas we can be thankful that it is no worse , " responded <name> , who was always ready to look on the bright side .
the <name> subsided after a blow of twenty-four hours and then the bow of the columbia was once more set towards her destination .
only a few knots had been covered when the lookout reported a vessel in sight .
" it 's a steamer ! "
cried <name> , for the smoke from the craft 's funnels was plainly to be seen .
" maybe she 's a warship , " returned <name> grandon , who was beside him .
" if so , i <name> she 's a japanese . "
the steamer was coming along at a good rate of speed and soon they made her out to be a british vessel .
she was a " tramp , " that is , a vessel going from port to port , picking up whatever cargo can be found .
" ahoy , there ! "
cried captain ponsberry , as the tramp slowed up .
" what ship is that ? "
" the lord <unk> , " was the answer .
" what ship is that ? "
" the columbia . "
" where are you bound ? "
" for nagasaki .
and you ? "
" for hong-kong . "
a little more talk followed , and the captain of the lord <unk> vouchsafed the information that he had sighted a russian warship the day before .
" a warship ! "
murmured <name> .
" which way was she bound ? "
asked captain ponsberry , anxiously .
" i ca n't tell you .
she stopped us and asked a few questions and then slipped away in the darkness . "
" what warship was she ? "
" the pocastra , from <unk> .
i think she used to be in the merchant service and was built over for the navy . "
the captain of the british steamer could give no further information , and so resumed his course , and the master of the columbia did likewise .
" ai n't very nice news , is it ? "
said <name> grandon .
" it 's very unpleasant news , " returned captain ponsberry , with a shrug of his shoulders .
" what are you going to do about it ? "
" what can we do , <name> ?
trust to luck that we get into nagasaki harbor , or some other port , in safety . "
" we 'll have to keep a sharp lookout for anything that looks like a warship , unless , of course , she flies a japanese flag . "
word was passed around to those who could be trusted , and all day long one of the mates and a foremast hand were kept on the lookout , taking turns at looking through the best glass the schooner possessed .
" this is almost as exciting as being in a war , " said <name> , when he was on duty with <name> .
" do n't you know how we looked for the spanish ships ? "
" yes , lad ; but if we sight a russian warship it <name> be small fighting we 'll do , to my way of thinking . "
" oh , we wo n't be able to fight at all .
we 'll simply have to rely on our wits to keep us out of being <unk> up as a prize of war , " responded the young second mate .
chapter xi an order to <unk> when taking on his cargo at manila , captain ponsberry had considered the possibility of being captured by a russian warship , and had talked the matter over with the agents of the richmond importing company and with a japanese official who was doing business on the sly in the philippines .
the japanese government was willing to pay for the cargo , whether it was delivered or not  presuming it was " <unk> up " by the russians , but was not willing to pay for the ship if the vessel was taken as a prize of war .
" that is a risk you must take yourself , " said the japanese official .
" we are willing to pay a high price for the cargo  we can not do more . "
and so the risk  so far as the schooner went  was divided equally between the richmond importing company and captain ponsberry and the other owners of the columbia .
as nearly the captain 's whole wealth was tied up in his share of the schooner , he was naturally anxious to make a safe trip , and he often came on deck to aid the <unk> in watching for the possible appearance of an enemy .
" if you see the least thing that looks suspicious , tell me at once , " was his order , and it was strictly obeyed .
as a consequence they ran away from two steamers that afternoon and another steamer the next morning  all too far off to show exactly what they were .
" this is n't bringing us much nearer to port , " said <name> to cal <name> , who was using the glass at the time .
" i do n't believe we have made a dozen knots since yesterday . "
" well , the old man is a bit nervous , " responded the boatswain , in a low voice .
" and i do n't blame him .
it 's no small matter to lose your craft and be thrown into prison in the bargain . "
" would they dare to throw us into prison ? "
" to be sure ,  if they could prove that we were aiding the japs . "
" well , they 'll have hard work proving that . "
an hour went by and it began to grow <name> .
then came a call from the bow .
" sail in sight ! "
" what is it ? "
demanded the captain instantly .
" a big steamer o ' some sort . "
captain ponsberry ran forward and took the glass .
for fully two minutes he did not speak and then he <name> a long breath and put down the glass .
" i 'm afraid she 's a warship , " he exclaimed , and his voice sounded unnatural .
" a warship ! "
echoed <name> .
" <name> you let me look ? "
he did so , and it was not long before he could make out the approaching craft quite clearly .
" well ? "
demanded grandon , who knew that <name> 's eyes were unusually strong .
" i reckon the captain is right . "
" a warship ? "
" yes , not a very large affair , but still a warship .
i should n't be surprised if she was the converted vessel the lord <unk> sighted . "
" just what i think , " put in captain ponsberry .
" we 've got to do our best to show her a clean pair of heels . "
" the mist may help us to run away , " suggested grandon .
" let us <name> so . "
necessary orders were given , and soon the columbia swung around on another tack , so that she had the large vessel on her starboard quarter .
but this movement was evidently noted by the stranger , and the latter headed directly for the schooner once more .
" she is after us , that is positive , " said captain ponsberry .
" there is a bank of mist over to the northward , " returned <name> .
" why not run into that ? "
" well spoken , lad ; we 'll do it , and as soon as the mist hides us we can go over on the other tack and throw her off the scent . "
the mist the young second mate had mentioned was nearly a quarter of a mile away and it was a question whether they could reach it before the stranger came up .
but fortune favored those on the schooner .
the mist rolled toward them , and in less than two minutes they were hidden as completely as could be desired .
" now to get entirely out of the way , " exclaimed captain ponsberry , and lost not a moment in having the sails shifted and a new course set .
through the mist they heard the other vessel steaming around <unk> and did their best to keep as far away as possible from the sound .
all during that evening and the night to follow the columbia kept to her new course .
this was taking her away from nagasaki , but this could not be helped .
the captain said if it became absolutely necessary he would run into some other japanese port .
when daybreak came the mist was as thick as ever .
but there were signs that it would not last much longer , and by nine o'clock the sun was struggling to come through the clouds .
nearly everybody was on deck , for they realized that a fatal moment might be at hand .
" there she is ! "
the cry came from half a dozen throats simultaneously .
there , on the port bow , loomed up the stranger , not an eighth of a mile away .
that she was a warship there was no longer any doubt , for her forward guns were plainly to be seen .
" we 're caught now ! "
muttered <name> grandon .
" not yet ! "
cried the captain , and gave orders to throw the columbia over on a new course .
but scarcely had this movement been made when there was a puff of smoke from the warship , a report , and a shot flew in front of the schooner 's bow .
" there 's our order to <unk> ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" whoever she is , she means business . "
as the columbia did not stop , another shot was fired , this time just grazing the bow .
seeing there was no help for it , captain ponsberry gave the necessary orders , and down came one sail after another .
as this was done the warship swung around and then those on the schooner saw that she flew the flag of russia .
" a russian warship ! "
ejaculated half a dozen .
" this looks to me as if the jig was up , " murmured <name> grandon .
as quickly as it could be done , captain ponsberry assembled his men on deck .
" men , " he said , briefly , " the officers on board of that warship wish to find out what they can about us .
if you are asked questions say nothing more than that you shipped for the voyage to nagasaki and san <name> , and that you know nothing about the cargo .
do you understand ? "
" aye , aye , sir , " came from those who were listening .
" i must depend upon you to help save the ship .
if the columbia is suspected of being in the employ of the japanese government , or of carrying a cargo for that nation , she <name> be taken as a prize of war and we 'll go to a russian prison most likely . "
" i do n't want to go to no russian prison ! "
cried out <name> , his face turning pale .
" i ai n't done nothing wrong ! "
" then keep your tongue from wagging too much , <name> , " answered the master of the schooner , grimly .
" there ai n't no use o ' fighting , is there ? "
asked <unk> .
" fighting ? "
came from <name> grandon .
" what could the old columbia do against a man-o'-war ?
why , they 'd blow us sky high in no time ! "
" no , there is absolutely no use of attempting to fight , " answered captain ponsberry .
" our only <name> lays in convincing them that they have no right to stop us . "
the hands were dismissed and sent forward , and captain ponsberry hurried below , to burn certain papers and secrete others .
this was in accordance with the orders received from the agents of the richmond importing company at manila .
in the meantime the russian warship had come to a stop in <unk> and now a small boat was lowered , containing a small crew , a <unk> , and a russian naval officer .
at the same time a signal was hoisted which meant that the officer was coming on board of the schooner .
" unless i miss my guess , this looks rather black for us , " said <name> , to <name> grandon .
" i agree with you , <name> , " responded the first mate .
" but we 've got to take our medicine , no matter how bitter it is . "
" if only that mist had held on to-day !
we might have slipped by that warship nicely . "
" i only <name> the old man fixes up his papers so that he can show a clean <name> of health , " went on grandon .
" you see , if they ca n't actually prove something against us , they wo n't dare to touch us .
they know what old <name> means , and russia has no <name> just now to get into trouble with uncle <name> . "
" the worst of it is , our cargo may look too suspicious to them .
under ordinary circumstances they know that the columbia would n't be carrying such a line of goods in these waters . "
" that 's true , too . "
" besides that , they may have had an agent at nagasaki and at manila spying on us .
they may know just what is being done .
the <unk> followers are mighty slick , i can tell you . "
captain ponsberry now came on deck and gave quick orders that the sailors should be lined up , to receive the visitor in a <unk> manner .
" a little goose grease may help , " he drawled , with a knowing glance at grandon and <name> .
the foremast hands did not know much about lining up , but took the places assigned to them , on the forward deck .
over the side a rope ladder was thrown , and then captain ponsberry , <name> grandon , and <name> awaited the arrival of the russian naval officer with keen interest .
chapter xii taken as a prize of war slowly but surely the small boat came closer to the schooner .
she rode the long swells of the pacific with full <name> , and <name> could not help but admire the long , sturdy strokes of the jackies , as they bent to their task .
" i do n't know but that they can handle a small boat as well as our own jackies , " said <name> .
" why should n't they ?
russian naval training ought to be first-class , " answered <name> grandon .
" they have been at it longer than uncle <name> . "
" true , but that does n't always count .
spain had been at it longer than we had , too , but when it came to war we beat her in double-quick order . "
as the small boat came closer they saw that the jackies were mostly men of middle age .
but the <unk> was younger and so was the naval officer , who was gazing rather anxiously toward the schooner , as if wondering what the result of his mission would be .
" wonder if that chap can talk english ? "
queried the first mate .
" if he ca n't the old man <name> be up a tree , for none of us can talk russian . "
" i reckon peterson and semmel can talk it , " answered <name> .
" but we do n't want either of those rascals to open his mouth . "
at last the small boat came up alongside of the columbia .
it was no easy matter to catch the rope ladder without getting bumped , but it was successfully accomplished , and then the russian officer lost no time in coming on board .
he at once saluted , and captain ponsberry and his mates did the same , and the sailors in the background did likewise .
" what ship is this ? "
asked the russian naval officer , after a few necessary formalities were at an end .
" the american schooner columbia , " answered captain ponsberry .
" would you mind telling me for what port you are bound ? "
went on the naval officer , who could speak fairly good english .
" we are bound for san <name> , with a <unk> at nagasaki . "
" ah !
what sort of a cargo are you carrying to nagasaki ? "
" one belonging to the firm for which the columbia is in commission . "
" the name of the firm , please ? "
" the richmond importing company . "
" ah ! "
said the naval officer again , and looked slightly displeased .
as it happened he had a brother in the army at port <name> , and had heard of the doings of <name> pennington at that place , and of how the young american had accused certain russians of trying to cheat the company he represented .
" what warship do you come from ? "
demanded captain ponsberry , feeling that he had an equal right to ask questions .
" the auxiliary cruiser , pocastra , of the russian navy , " answered the naval officer , politely .
" and where are you bound ? "
went on captain ponsberry , bluntly .
" that , sir , is a question only our commander , captain <unk> , can answer . "
" it 's queer you are steaming around in japanese waters . "
" perhaps so . "
the russian naval officer smiled in a knowing way .
" captain ponsberry , i am sorry , but i think i shall have to inspect your papers . "
captain ponsberry <name> himself up , resolved to put on as bold a front as possible .
" this is an american ship , sir . "
" granted , but i have my orders , " returned the naval officer , coldly .
" if i refuse to let you inspect the papers ? "
the young russian officer shrugged his shoulders .
" we shall be under the painful necessity of compelling you to show them . "
" you threaten me  an american captain ! "
" there is no help for it  i am simply obeying orders .
we inspect all ships that we find in this vicinity . "
" do you know i can make you pay dearly for this outrage ? "
" you can not call it an outrage .
you are in japanese waters , japan and russia are at war .
you knew that before you came into these waters .
am i to see the papers or not ? "
the commander of the columbia knew that the russian naval officer spoke the truth .
yet he made one more effort .
" very well ; i <name> show my papers , but i shall insist upon you signing a paper that your ship held us up . "
" you can send the paper to my ship for such a signature from my captain , " said the russian , <unk> .
by this time four of the jackies of the small boat had come on board .
all were armed and they lined up at the rail , close to the rope ladder .
they were good-natured sailors and grinned broadly at the hands on the columbia .
not one could speak a word of english , so conversation with them was impossible .
captain ponsberry led the way to the cabin of the columbia and the young russian officer followed .
getting out such papers as had been prepared for the occasion , the master of the schooner passed them over .
" these are correct so far as they go , " said the russian , after an examination lasting ten minutes had been made .
" but   " he paused .
" you have no further papers ? "
" those are my papers , sir , " answered captain ponsberry , briefly .
" then i <name> look at a specified list of your cargo . "
" i have n't such a list , " was the answer , which was true , as the list had been burnt up just a short while before .
at this statement the young russian frowned .
" every ship carries such a list . "
" still , i have n't any . "
" in that case , i shall have to order an inspection of the cargo . "
" sir , you are going too far ! "
said captain ponsberry , sternly , yet he knew he had no right to expect anything else .
" if i am going too far , i am able to take the consequences , " returned the russian , who was acting strictly under orders .
" very well , sir ; you can look the cargo over , " answered captain ponsberry .
" but i shall hold russia accountable for the outrage . "
the russian naval officer bowed and hastened up to the deck .
he spoke in his native tongue to one of the jackies who carried several small flags under his arm .
at once the <name> began to <unk> to the warship for further instructions .
" search the ship , " came back the order , and in a few minutes more another small boat left the side of the pocastra , containing an officer and a crew of eight .
" we are in for it now , that is certain , " observed <name> .
" they are not going to let us go until they are sure we are o. k. " the second boat was soon alongside of the schooner , and the officer in charge and four men came up on the deck and joined the other russians already there .
an <name> conversation was held between the two officers .
" we 'll take a general look at the cargo , " said the one who had just arrived .
" it <name> not do to go too far  in case we find everything as it should be .
we want no trouble with the yankee government . "
captain ponsberry was asked to have the <unk> hatch opened , and this work was done by <name> striker and several others .
then two of the russian sailors were sent below , and one of the officers went along .
in the meantime , peterson , unknown to anybody on board , had slipped off to the brig .
here he found ostag semmel in solitary confinement .
" semmel , a russian warship is close at hand , " he said , hurriedly .
" an officer and some men have just boarded us . "
" release me , peterson ! "
returned the russian sailor .
" release me and i <name> show captain ponsberry what i can do ! "
" you <name> not get me into trouble ? "
questioned peterson , anxiously .
" no .
quick  i am sure we can make money out of this . "
with an iron bar , peterson pried off the lock which had been put on the door of the brig , and <name> back the bolt .
then semmel came out of his prison , with his hands linked together .
as he was making his way to the stern deck <name> caught sight of him .
" stop ! "
he called out , in alarm , realizing what semmel might do .
" stop , semmel ! "
and he ran to capture the rascal .
" get out da <unk> ! "
roared the russian and aimed a blow at <name> 's head .
but the young second mate dodged and then caught the russian by the legs , hurling him flat on his breast .
but now peterson came behind and gave <name> a vicious kick in the side , which made the youth let go his hold .
" what 's the row there ? "
called out captain ponsberry , and looked much disturbed to see the escaped prisoner .
" put him back where he came from ! "
" help ! "
yelled semmel , in russian .
" help , in the name of the czar !
i am a russian subject !
this ship is in the employ of the japanese government ! "
" he speaks the truth ! "
called out peterson , also in russian .
" help us and protect us and we <name> prove it ! "
and he ran forward to where the russian officer on deck was standing .
" you are russians ? "
asked the officer , quickly .
" we are . "
" then i shall certainly assist you . "
he raised his voice .
" let that man go ! "
and he pointed at semmel , now surrounded by <name> , <name> , and cal <name> .
the latter words were uttered in english , so all of our friends understood them .
the two sailors looked inquiringly at the young second mate .
" he is nothing but a mutineer , " said <name> .
" we locked him up for it .
he ought to have been strung up on the <unk> , " he added , bitterly .
by this time captain ponsberry was on the scene , and those who had gone below were summoned on deck once more .
the captain glared at semmel , who lost no time in shrinking behind the russian officers for protection .
" i can prove the cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government , " said ostag semmel .
" my friend can prove it , too , " he added , pointing to peterson .
" it is true we tried to seize the ship  to take her to <unk> , or some other russian port , as a prize . "
" this is assuredly interesting , " said the leading russian officer .
" tell me your tale in full . "
despite captain ponsberry 's protests semmel told his story in his own way , and peterson corroborated it in every detail .
then shamhaven , thinking to curry favor , came forward .
" they tell the strict truth , " he said .
" i worked with them .
we did what we could for the benefit of the russian government .
every bit of cargo on this ship belongs to the japanese government and was to be taken ashore at nagasaki .
the last cargo of the columbia was also sold at nagasaki to the japanese government . "
" when was this ? "
" about two months ago . "
more questions were put to semmel , peterson , and shamhaven , and at last the russian naval officer turned grimly to captain ponsberry .
" i have heard their story , and it <name> be unnecessary to make an inspection of your cargo , since they have told me of what it consists .
in the name of russia i claim this ship as a prize of war , and you and your crew must consider yourselves prisoners . "
chapter xiii prisoners on the " pocastra " captain ponsberry had feared the result ever since the unexpected appearance of ostag semmel , so he was not very much surprised when the russian naval officer stated that he should consider the columbia as a war prize and place those on board under arrest as prisoners of war .
" this is a high-handed proceeding , " said he , as calmly as possible , although his mind was in a whirl .
" i do not think so , " answered the russian officer .
" do you submit or not ? "
" since it would be useless to fight , we shall have to submit , " answered the master of the schooner .
" but , remember , i shall hold you and the russian government responsible for all you do . "
" as you have said that before , there is no use of repeating it , captain ponsberry .
we <name> take command of the vessel at once . "
" what are we going to do ? "
whispered <name> to <name> grandon .
" i do n't know  follow the old man , i reckon , " answered the first mate .
" we shall place a prize crew on this ship , " went on the russian officer .
" these men "  pointing to semmel , peterson , and shamhaven  " can remain on board .
the remainder of the crew and the officers , <name> be transferred to the pocastra .
i <name> give you a quarter of an hour in which to attend to your luggage .
please take no more along than is necessary . "
" this is certainly high-handed ! "
cried <name> .
" so we 've got to go over to that old coal box , eh ? "
grumbled <name> , when he heard the news .
" it 's hard luck , <name> . "
" you 're right , <name> , but it ca n't be helped . "
" what <name> they do with us ? "
" i have n't the least idea . "
" <name> they take us to russia ? "
" i suppose so  or stow us away in one of those cold and dirty siberian prisons until we can get uncle <name> to make them release us . "
when it came time to depart from the columbia <name> was allowed to take only a bundle of clothing along , and grandon and the common sailors were treated no better .
the captain was allowed a trunk and a suit case .
in the meantime semmel was questioned once more , and what he had to tell made the russians look darkly at our friends .
" he is pumping all sorts of falsehoods into them , i suppose , " said <name> to <name> , and he was right .
semmel made it appear that captain ponsberry was really an agent of the japanese government and that he ( semmel ) had done his best to gain possession of the ship wholly for the benefit of his own country .
" if you really did this , it is very worthy of you , " said one of the officers .
" but we shall have to investigate before we accept your story in full . "
this was not so encouraging , but with it ostag semmel had to be content .
fearing that a japanese warship might put in an appearance at any moment , the russians lost no time in transferring the officers and men of the columbia to the pocastra and at the same time a prize crew of two officers and ten men were taken from the warship to the schooner .
then the sails of the columbia were hoisted and off she set to the eastward , and the warship moved in the same direction .
when placed aboard the pocastra captain ponsberry was treated politely and given a small room of his own .
but the mates and the ordinary seamen were not so fortunate .
grandon , <name> , and <name> striker were hustled off to a prison pen on one deck of the auxiliary cruiser , and the others to another pen below , which was even worse .
" this is certainly hard luck , " said <name> , as he threw his bundle into a corner and sat down on an iron bench , while grandon and <name> did the same .
" and after we had almost reached nagasaki , too ! "
" well , there ai n't no use to cry over spilt milk , " came from <name> .
" we 're prisoners o ' war , an ' i reckon as how we have got to make the best o ' it .
ai n't the first time we 've been in sech a fix . "
" that is true , <name> , but it does n't help the matter any .
i guess we have seen the last of the old columbia . "
" i was afraid of this sort of thing happening ever since we left manila , " came from grandon .
" i told the old man to be careful , that   " " hush ! "
whispered <name> .
" they may be listening  to make sure that they have caught the right parties . "
" true for you , <name> ; i wo n't say another word about that .
but it looks dismal , no two ways o n't , " and the first mate <name> a mountainous sigh .
the prison pen into which they had been placed was an iron structure , reaching from floor to ceiling , and was not over ten feet square .
it had a solid back and the remaining three sides were built up of stout iron bars , only a couple of inches apart .
there was a door which was doubly locked , the key being held by a petty officer who could speak broken english and who rejoiced in the simple name of <unk> .
for short <name> <unk> him <unk> and this name stuck to him .
" does n't look as if a fellow could break out of here very easily , " said <name> , after an inspection of their prison .
" this is a regular bank vault . "
" would n't do you any good to break out , " returned grandon .
" as we are on the ocean , where would you go to ? "
" we might hide until the vessel made a landing . "
" humph , and that would be in some russian port , so you 'd be just as bad off . "
" well , i 'm not trying to escape just now .
i want to get the lay of the land first , and try to find out what they are going to do with us . "
from <unk> they learned that the pocastra was one of a large number of steamers of various russian lines which had been lately pressed into the service of the national navy .
she had been rushed through at one of the russian navy yards and provided with a battery of four small and four large guns , none , however , over eight inches .
she carried a crew of one hundred and eighty men , drafted principally from other warships .
she had an advertised speed of twenty knots an hour but rarely made over seventeen or eighteen .
she was old and her engines were constantly in need of repair , much to the disgust of captain <unk> , her commander .
" well , <unk> , how goes this war ? "
asked <name> , pleasantly , as the petty officer came around to give them something to eat .
" big fight all der dime , " answered <unk> .
" russians kill all der japs  sink all der jap ships , yes ! "
" you 're winning right along , eh ? "
" yes , russians win  japs no do noddings , no ! "
and the petty officer left the food on the bench and hurried away again .
" do you believe that ? "
asked <name> .
" no , i do n't , " came from grandon .
" he told us that simply to scare us , or else he does n't know the real truth . "
" exactly what i think . "
" these russians are a lot of <unk> , " growled <name> .
" just look at semmel .
he was forever tooting his horn , and yet he could n't do much of anything . "
" he got us into trouble , " said <name> , quickly .
" that 's true , but he had to have this warship with all on board to help him . "
the food which had been brought to them consisted of a big bowl of stew , with three spoons , and three chunks of black bread .
" they are going to treat us to the best , " said grandon , sarcastically .
he lifted one of the spoons and tasted the stew .
" phew , it 's hot enough !
pepper , garlic , and hot water ! "
" does beat all how these <unk> do love their garlic , " grumbled <name> .
" 't was the same way with them spaniards in the philippines . "
" garlic and grease , " added <name> .
" and this bread is hard enough to build a wall with , " he continued .
" however , we have got to eat or go hungry . "
and he partook of just enough to stay his stomach .
<name> and grandon were not so particular and despite their grumbling managed to make away with all that remained .
they saw nothing of the captain , or of the sailors who had been taken below , and the time <name> heavily on their hands .
at night they were given three <unk> and these they slung from one side of the prison to the other and rested as well as could be expected .
the russian sailors often came to the pen to gaze at them , but they had been warned not to attempt to converse with the prisoners , so nothing was said .
on the afternoon of the third day aboard of the pocastra , those in the pen heard a loud shouting on deck , followed by a rush of feet .
<name> , who was resting in the corner for the want of something better to do , leaped up .
" something is doing ! "
he cried to his companions .
" here comes captain ponsberry , " ejaculated <name> grandon .
he was right , the captain was coming up in company with <unk> and two sailors .
the russian petty officer opened the door of the pen and captain ponsberry was thrust inside .
then the door was locked as before .
" how are you , boys ? "
cried the captain , cordially .
" all well , i <name> . "
" we are , " answered grandon .
" and you ? "
" i 'm well enough , but still angry to think that we lost the columbia . "
" so are we angry , " said <name> .
" but we 've got to stand it .
what 's that noise ? "
" they have sighted a chinese junk , and i reckon they are going to treat her as they did our vessel , " answered the captain .
the noise on deck continued , followed by quarter of an hour of silence .
then came a shot , followed by a second and a third .
" another order to <unk> , " said <name> .
" wonder if the chinamen <name> give in as we did ? "
" they <name> if they are wise , " said grandon .
but the chinamen did not believe in surrendering thus easily .
they were carrying rice for the japanese army , and thought that this was known to the enemy .
consequently they did their best to sail away .
hardly had the craft started on a new course when the pocastra opened a direct fire upon her .
the noise below decks was deafening and fairly shook the iron pen in which our friends were confined .
" hullo , that sounds like real war ! "
cried <name> .
" they mean business now . "
one broadside was followed by another , and the chinese junk was raked from end to end with such a deadly fire that more than a sixth of the sailors and officers were killed .
then the captain flung a white flag to the breeze in token of surrender .
" we have won ! "
cried those on the pocastra , and it was not long before our friends understood .
small boats were put out , and presently half a dozen chinese officers from the junk were brought on board as prisoners .
a fire that had started on the prize ship was put out after some hard work ; and then a temporary crew was put on board , and the junk followed in the wake of the old columbia , with the warship keeping guard over both .
chapter xiv progress of the war an hour after the capture of the chinese junk one of the officers of the ill-fated craft was thrust into the prison pen with our friends .
he was a small <unk> celestial rejoicing in the name of won lung , and it was soon learned that he could speak a little english , he having once paid a visit to san <name> .
" all go up spout ! "
said he , referring to his own ship .
" t'ink we safe when russian gunboat come , den all up spout ! "
" did they sink your ship ? "
asked captain ponsberry .
" no sink  shoot holes , back , front , side  all up spout .
no <unk> no more den  all up spout ! "
the latter was his pet phrase and he used it over and over again .
" you were in the japanese trade ? "
" yes  <name> rice .
now russians got rice , got junk  all won lung 's money gone up spout ! "
and the celestial made an odd little <unk> .
" well , they took my ship , too . "
" big schooner your <unk> ? "
" yes . "
" won lung weep for you  all ship gone up spout , <unk> like won <unk> ship gone up spout ! "
" well , we have n't gone up the spout yet , " put in <name> , with a laugh .
" let us thank fortune that we are alive and well . "
" dat so  won lung lose <unk> on junk  six , seven , ten  do n't know how many yet , " and the chinese officer shook his head sadly .
" bad war , bad ! "
" can you tell us how the war is going ? "
asked <name> grandon .
" these russians say everything is a russian victory . "
" russians <unk> dat ? "
" yes  they pretend to say they have the japs about beaten . "
at this won lung screwed up his eyes into mere slits .
" big lie dat .
japanese win <unk> <unk> <unk> .
russian warships gone up spout  russian army run like  like  up spout ! "
after that won lung told them all he knew .
it was hard to understand him , yet they gathered that there had been another sea fight in the vicinity of port <name> , in which the russian navy had come off second best , and that the japanese army that had landed in <unk> had driven the enemy to the <unk> , over the <unk> river , and was now forcing them back upon <unk> .
" if this news about the army is true , <name> and <name> must be having a hot time of it , " was <name> 's comment .
" i must say , i am mighty glad they are on the winning side . "
" did n't i tell ye them russians are a lot o ' <unk> ? "
came from <name> .
" the truth ai n't in 'em half the time . "
" perhaps they do not get the correct news from the front , " came from captain ponsberry .
" the <unk> may keep the bad news back , for fear of disheartening the rest of the men in the army and navy . "
" they tell me the russians are very strict about sending out news , " rejoined <name> .
" it is true , <name> ; no country on the globe is <unk> .
no telegram can be sent without it is inspected , and the newspapers can not print a single scrap of news , or a single editorial , until after the press censor has passed upon it . "
" if that 's the case , i do n't wonder that some of the people want to be free . "
" russia is more free to-day than she ever was before , and freedom is bound to come sooner or later  that is , i mean , not such freedom as we have in the united states , but such freedom as they have in england and germany  where , at least , a man can call his soul his own . "
" it 's a wonder the russians <name> fight for their country , if they are so ground down . "
" they know nothing better , and besides , they are really patriotic .
if the czar would only treat them a little better , and give them a little more <name> , they would be the most faithful of subjects .
but when a man ca n't do at all as he wants to do , and ca n't open his mouth about it either , he is apt to grow sullen and ugly . "
as day after day went by life on the russian warship became almost unendurable for <name> and the others .
they suffered greatly for the want of fresh air , and at last made a vigorous protest to the captain of the ship , when he happened to be passing the pen .
as a result orders were given that they should be allowed three hours on deck each day , one in the morning and two after dinner .
" this is a little like , " said <name> , when coming on deck for the first time .
" oh , how good it feels to breathe fresh air once more ! "
and he filled his lungs to their fullest capacity .
for their daily exercise <name> and <name> were chained together , and the pair inspected with great curiosity as much of the warship as was allowed .
" it 's not so very different from some of our own auxiliary cruisers , " said <name> .
" but , after all , i like ours better . "
" that 's right , lad ; stick up fer your own country every trip . "
" well , what do you say , <name> ? "
" i say i 'd rather be on one of uncle <name> 's ships than on any other in the world . "
while allowed to roam around on deck , <name> often looked eagerly for the columbia , but the schooner and the chinese junk were too far off to be distinguished with the naked eye .
" we 'd give a good deal to be back on her deck , would n't we , <name> ? "
said he .
" do n't mention it , lad ; it makes me sick , " grumbled the yankee tar .
" i wish i knew just what was being done on land , do n't you ?
perhaps this war <name> end soon , and then we 'll be set free . "
" it wo n't end yet awhile , <name> , <name> my words on that , " answered <name> .
the old yankee sailor was right  the war was far from ended , and here it may be well to note briefly what was taking place on the sea between russia and japan , while the army of the mikado was pushing through <unk> in the direction of <unk> .
the loss of the great battleship <unk> has already been recorded in " under the mikado 's flag . "
this vessel was sunk by a mine in port <name> harbor , <name> 13 , 1904 , and carried down with her admiral <unk> and about five hundred officers and men .
at the same time the battleship <unk> was also injured by a mine .
the loss of the admiral 's <unk> was a great blow to russia , and while she was trying to recover , port <name> was vigorously shelled by the japanese fleet , and many buildings were more or less damaged .
some warehouses were set on fire , but the local fire department , aided by the russian garrison , succeeded in putting out the conflagration .
while the japanese fleet was hammering at the city and the ships from beyond the harbor , the japanese army encircled port <name> on land , taking possession of every available hill beyond the russian line of defenses .
as a consequence , by the middle of may the city was in a complete state of siege , nearly all communication with the outside world being cut off .
but now came a turn in affairs which , for a short while , made matters look favorable for russia .
while the fleet of admiral togo was <unk> the whole of the southeastern coast of <unk> and protecting the japanese transports which were pouring troops into the country , occurred a catastrophe as appalling as it was unexpected .
on the same day , may 15 , the magnificent battleship <unk> , of the japanese navy , was blown up by mines and sunk , and the protected cruiser , <unk> , also of admiral togo 's fleet , <unk> in the fog with a sister ship , and was a total loss .
it is estimated that by these two disasters seven hundred men were lost .
among the officers who met their fate were men of marked ability which japan at this crisis could ill afford to lose .
the loss of the <unk> is worth relating in detail .
she had been along the coast during a heavy fog , but this had cleared off and the sun was shining brightly .
not an enemy was in sight , and all was quiet on the great battleship when , without warning , a terrific explosion was felt near the stern and a portion of the steering gear was damaged .
" we have struck a mine ! "
cried some one on board , and without delay signals were hoisted for the other vessels in sight to stand by .
the battleship was drifting and the locality was full of mines .
it was a moment of terrible suspense .
then came another explosion , greater than the first , which ripped large holes through her heavy plates .
at once the battleship began to fill , and presently she sank like a stone to the bottom of the sea .
the other warships put out their small boats with all speed , and succeeded in rescuing about three hundred officers and men out of a total of nearly eight hundred .
among those lost were <unk> <unk> and captain <unk> , the commander of the warship .
the <unk> was lost while steaming slowly southward , after a <unk> vigil near the entrance to port <name> harbor .
other vessels of the <unk> fleet were close by , so each ship had to advance with extreme caution .
but the fog , instead of lifting , became thicker , and at a little before two o'clock in the afternoon the cruiser was rammed by the <unk> , another vessel of the fleet .
a large hole was torn in the hull of the <unk> .
" out with the collision mats ! "
cried the commander of the cruiser , and the mats were brought out without delay and placed over the side .
but the hole was too great to be stopped in that manner .
then the captain called the entire crew on deck , and ordered the small boats to be lowered , five on the starboard side and one on the port .
before the boats could be gotten away , the <unk> listed heavily to starboard and went down , smashing the five small boats under her .
the other boat managed to get away , with only a handful of jackies and a couple of officers .
the captain remained on the bridge and went down with his ship .
as soon as possible the <unk> put out her boats and succeeded in rescuing about ninety men , out of a total of over two hundred and fifty .
it was a great blow to japan and the russians were correspondingly elated .
feeling that admiral togo 's grip on the sea was now weakened , the russian squadron at <unk> sailed forth and did much damage to the shipping on the northern coast of japan , sinking several merchantmen and taking a number of others as prizes .
the russian squadron also met the japanese transport <unk> <unk> , having on board the <unk> regiment of japanese infantry .
" surrender , or we <name> sink you ! "
<unk> the russian commander .
the japanese refused , and were given exactly an hour in which to think it over .
as they still refused , a torpedo was discharged against the doomed ship .
as she began to sink the japanese soldiers opened fire with their rifles , and then the russians answered with their machine guns , mowing down the mikado 's men by the score .
but the japanese were brave to the last , and sank beneath the waves with the cry of <unk> !
( hurrah ! )
on their lips .
it was an auxiliary cruiser of the <unk> squadron which had taken the columbia and the chinese junk as prizes of war .
the captain of the cruiser was now looking for the rest of the squadron , but so far none of the warships had been sighted .
" they must have returned to <unk> , " he reasoned , and then turned in that direction with the pocastra , never dreaming of what the near future held in store for himself , his ship , and his crew .
chapter xv a sharp naval battle so far the weather had been good , but following the conversation recorded in the last chapter there came up a dense fog , and for twenty-four hours the russian warship did nothing but creep along in the gloom .
during that time , for some unknown reason , <name> and the others were allowed greater freedom than before .
each had his hands chained behind him , but all were separate , which allowed each to roam around as he pleased .
" this is better than being linked to somebody else , " said the youth to his old sailor friend .
" not but that we got along well enough together , " he added , hastily .
" you 're right  there was n't no sense in <unk> ' us together , " answered <name> .
" we ca n't git away if we want to . "
" we might , if we did n't have our hands chained , <name> . "
" how ? "
" if we all got together some night  providing we could keep out of the pen  and stole one of the small boats . "
" easier said nor done .
the guard would ketch ye an ' shoot ye down like a dog . "
" oh , i know there would be a great risk .
but i hate to think of going to a siberian prison , or aboard a russian prison ship . "
" so do i , <name> .
but even if we stole the boat and got away , where would we go to ,  especially if we did n't have much provisions an ' water ? "
<name> could not answer that question , since he did not know the location of the pocastra .
it might be that they were hundreds of miles from land .
if so , to take to a small boat with a scarcity of water and provisions would certainly be foolhardy .
the fog continued during the night , but swept away as if by magic about nine o'clock in the morning .
at that time the prisoners had had their breakfast and <name> and <name> were between decks , looking at some gunners ' assistants cleaning out one of the large guns .
suddenly came a call from the lookout , followed by half a dozen commands .
as everything said was in russian , our friends did not understand a word , but they soon realized that something unusual was in the air .
a shrill whistle sounded out and drums began to beat to quarters .
" i 'll wager a new hat they have sighted a japanese ship ! "
cried <name> , and scarcely had he spoken when there came a dull booming over the water .
" let us go to the deck an ' see what 's doing , " returned <name> , and both started for the stairs .
but scarcely had they appeared on the deck when they were ordered below again .
<name> was right ; a japanese warship had been sighted , and this vessel had lost no time in discharging a signal gun to a sister ship only a few miles away .
hardly had the youth and his friend reached the lower deck once more than the japanese cruiser opened fire on the russian vessel .
the latter <unk> , and the booming of cannon shook the pocastra from stem to stern .
" this is a fight for fair ! "
ejaculated <name> , with a broad smile on his face .
" i <name> the japs win , <name> ! "
" so do i , lad .
but where do we come in , that 's what i want to know ? "
" if we could only drop overboard and swim to that other ship ! "
" no use of trying  some of the fellows in the tops would pick us off in no time .
no , we 've got to stay right where we are an ' take what comes . "
" where are the others ? "
they looked around , but could see nothing of captain ponsberry or <name> grandon .
they saw cal <name> run past , but he was out of sight before they could stop him .
suddenly a crash above them told that a solid shot had struck the upper works of the russian cruiser .
then came another crash at the bow .
" those japs know how to fire , " came from the yankee sailor .
" reckon as how they 're going to do their best to blow this ship <unk> .
i 'd give 'most a dollar to be somewhere else just about now ! "
and he shook his head anxiously .
the russian gunners were working with a <name> , and so were their numerous assistants .
the pocastra was swung around , and now both ships were broadside to each other .
the thunder of the guns was terrific and the smoke rolled around in all directions .
" puts me in mind o ' the battle o ' manila bay , eh ? "
remarked <name> , as he and <name> stood at a distance , watching the russians work one of the guns .
" you are right , <name> , only   " <name> got no further , for at that moment came another crash on deck .
the pocastra shivered and heaved , and to those below it was as if she would surely sink .
" they 're pumping it into us , sure as you 're born ! "
sang out the old yankee tar .
" hullo , what 's this ? "
there was a rush of several gunners across the deck .
" beware of that gun ! "
yelled one in russian , and then a stampede followed .
in the midst of the confusion came a fearful explosion from below .
a portion of the flooring was ripped apart and one of the gunners was instantly killed and several wounded .
a great volume of smoke rolled up , and splinters and bits of iron and steel flew in all directions .
both <name> and <name> were almost stunned by the explosion and for the moment could do nothing but clutch each other in terror .
both were struck by the flying splinters , but neither was seriously wounded .
they staggered back and began to cough , for the dense smoke was <unk> .
" must have been a torpedo   " gasped <name> .
" or else a magazine ! "
spluttered <name> .
" let  let us get  get out of here .
i 'm  choking  to  to  death ! "
it was really a magazine which had exploded .
this tore a good-sized hole in the <unk> side , in a spot impossible to get at in the confusion .
in the meantime a solid <unk> shell struck the russian ship squarely in the stern , doing additional damage and killing and wounding two officers and nine men .
almost choked to death , <name> and <name> crawled to where the ladder ran to the deck .
the russian jackies and gunners were swarming up , along with all the prisoners .
" <name> , are you safe ? "
came in the voice of captain ponsberry , and he loomed up , with <name> grandon , cal <name> , and the chinese petty officer beside him .
" so far i am , " answered <name> .
" but i  i  must have air ! "
and he began to cough .
the jam on the ladder was terrific , and in the midst of the <unk> a russian gunner and the chinese petty officer got into a quarrel .
the gunner threw the celestial down , but he bounced up like a ball , and in a twinkling the russian received a blow in the stomach which sent him staggering back into the crowd and the deadly smoke .
" no knock me up the spout ! "
sang out the celestial .
" ship go down i go <unk> ! "
and soon he was out on the upper deck .
fighting , surging , pushing , and yelling the russians and our friends got to the deck at last .
captain ponsberry had his coat literally ripped from his back , and cal <name> had an arm almost torn from its socket .
for this he gave a russian gunner a rap in the mouth which knocked loose several teeth .
it was a case of each man for himself , and many fought like wild beasts .
at last <name> found himself free of the crowd , with <name> still beside him .
captain ponsberry and cal <name> were not far away , but between surged a great number of russians .
the pocastra was <unk> heavily to port and had evidently taken a large quantity of water into her hull .
two japanese warships were now at hand and both were firing upon the doomed russian cruiser with deadly accuracy .
from the fighting tops of the mikado 's ships came a perfect hail of small bullets which sent the russians to the deck by the score .
by this fire one of the <unk> sailors was killed and cal <name> was seriously wounded .
a bullet likewise grazed <name> striker 's thigh , drawing some blood , but the yankee tar did not know of this until the conflict was at an end and he saw the crimson stain on his shoe top .
at last the russian captain saw that to fight further would be useless .
the pocastra was in danger of going down at any moment .
the guns could no longer be used , and he ordered the colors lowered and put up a signal of surrender .
a wild cheer came from the two japanese warships when it was realized that the battle was won .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " rent the air over and over again .
" hurrah for the mikado !
down with the russians ! "
a little while after the fighting came to an end , several small boats put off from the two japanese warships and half a dozen of the <unk> naval officers presented themselves at the <unk> side .
the russian ship still listed heavily , but after the smoke below had cleared away it was ascertained that the damage done was not as great as had been imagined .
one of the magazines which had been in danger of blowing up had been flooded , and the rush of sea water had likewise put out a fire that had started in the stern .
as soon as order could be restored on board of the pocastra a complete surrender was made to the japanese , the russian captain giving up his sword .
then a general conference was had lasting over an hour .
at the end of that time , much to their surprise , the americans were asked to go over to one of the japanese warships .
" we 'll go , and glad of the chance , " said captain ponsberry ; and soon the transfer was made .
chapter xvi aboard a japanese warship " what a beauty of a ship ! "
such was <name> 's exclamation as he stepped aboard of the japanese warship .
the vessel was , like the russian prize , an auxiliary cruiser and named the <unk> <unk> .
she was but three years old and had been used for passenger service between japan and <name> .
for such a small cruiser she carried an unusually heavy battery , and everything was shined up to the last degree ,  the work having been undertaken directly after the battle was over .
the <unk> <unk> had suffered but little damage during the contest and only a handful of men had been killed and wounded .
" this looks more like uncle <name> 's navy than anything i have seen yet , " said <name> .
" well , i do n't know that the decorations aboard our ships are quite so fine , " returned the youth .
" but then this is n't an ordinary fighting ship .
some of the auxiliary cruisers we used during the war with spain  those that used to be <unk> steamers  were just as fine as this and finer . "
as soon as those from the columbia reached the japanese warship the wounded were taken in charge by the surgeons and placed in the sick bay , as the hospital on a naval vessel is called .
this was also in the best of order , with nice , swinging cots , and appliances of the latest designs .
as there were many things to be arranged between the two japanese vessels and the russian prize , our friends were not interviewed until late in the evening .
in the meantime , some of the russians were made prisoners , and a prize crew was placed aboard of the pocastra .
then the two japanese warships moved away , with the captured cruiser between them .
" those russians must feel sick , " was <name> 's comment .
" it 's worse for them , in a way , than if their ship had gone down . "
" well , we all thought she was sinking , " returned captain ponsberry .
" if she had sunk i reckon some of us would n't be here to tell the tale . "
when evening came , a guard who could speak a little english conducted captain ponsberry , <name> , and <name> grandon to the commander 's cabin .
here they were met by captain <unk> , who , being a graduate of the japanese naval school , could speak not only english but also several other foreign languages .
it may be mentioned here that the japanese naval academy of to-day is one of the foremost institutions of its kind in the world .
" i <name> hear your story , captain ponsberry , " said the japanese captain , politely , as he motioned his visitors to be seated .
in a plain , direct manner the master of the columbia told his tale , starting from the time the schooner left manila with a cargo intended for the japanese government .
he told of the trouble with semmel and of the mutiny , and then of the capture by the pocastra .
" you have assuredly been unfortunate , " said captain <unk> .
" have you any idea where your schooner is now ? "
" i have not , but i thought she must be close to the russian ship  she and that chinese junk , too .
the pocastra was taking them to <unk> as prizes . "
" ah ! "
the japanese captain mused for a moment .
" i dare say you would like to gain back your ship ? "
he continued .
" indeed i would ! "
cried captain ponsberry .
" i 'd give a pretty dollar to do so ! "
" i shall interview the captain of the russian warship again to-morrow .
it may be that he <name> tell us where she is  although i doubt it . "
after this a few questions were put to <name> and <name> grandon and both corroborated what captain ponsberry had said .
they were also questioned concerning the treatment they had received while on the pocastra .
" you may be thankful that the treatment was no worse , " said captain <unk> .
" of late some of the russians have treated their prisoners in a most brutal fashion . "
" we are thankful , " replied the master of the columbia .
the majority of the staterooms aboard of the <unk> <unk> were occupied by the officers of the cruiser , but one small room was turned over to captain ponsberry , and a larger apartment was turned over to <name> grandon and <name> .
at <name> 's <unk> <name> striker was allowed to " bunk in " with the first and second mates .
" this 'ere ship is jest about next to a palace , " was <name> 's comment .
" ai n't seen nothing so fancy in a long time . "
the japanese warships were bound for the nearest naval station with their prize .
they could readily have made eighteen knots an hour , but the crippled russian cruiser could not make over ten , and so this was the rate of speed set for all three .
the americans were allowed the freedom of the ship and <name> and <name> spent many hours in inspecting the guns and other <unk> , and in watching the japanese jackies in the gun and cutlass drills , their physical exercises , and in their drills to fight fire and to lower the small boats .
everything on board ran as smoothly as clockwork , much to their delight .
" i can tell you what , <name> ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically , " this beats the russians all hollow !
i never saw anything so well done ! "
" almost beats our own navy , does n't it ? "
" well , i do n't know about that .
but it is certainly just as good .
that drill to fight fire is immense , and their physical exercises ought to make each man 's muscles like iron . "
" they are a sturdy lot , lad , no two ways about that ,  and they understand just how to keep themselves in the pink of condition . "
<name> rubbed his <name> reflectively .
" do ye know what i have in mind to do ? "
" i think i can make a pretty good guess , " came quickly from <name> .
" well ? "
" you 're thinking that you 'd like to join the japanese navy , just to have a mix-up or two with the russians . "
" you 've struck the nail on the head , lad .
and why not , seeing as how we are out here in fighting waters , and with no ship of our own to go aboard ? "
" well , i feel a good bit that way myself .
<name> is in the army , and so is <name> pennington .
if they can make a record for themselves why should n't i do the same ?
as it was i came close to joining the army with <name> . "
" so you told me before .
but you 're a born sailor , <name> , not a soldier . "
" i do n't deny it .
i 'd rather be on board of a ship than on land any day . "
" yes , to a fellow as gets used to the sea the land seems a strange place . "
from the japanese on the warship who could speak english our friends learned much concerning the war .
they were told that admiral <unk> fleet was keeping a strict guard over the harbor approach to port <name> , and that a portion of the japanese army was <unk> in the city on the land side and had lately captured several hills of importance .
from captain <unk> the americans obtained permission to station themselves in one of the fighting tops , and here they spent hour after hour , on the lookout for the columbia .
captain ponsberry was particularly anxious to find his vessel , and kept scanning the japan sea through a fine spyglass the japanese captain loaned him .
" if i can gain possession of that ship , i am going to fix semmel and peterson , " said the master of the columbia .
" both of them declared that they took possession of the ship for the sake of the russian government , " said <name> .
" that being the case , they should be treated as prisoners of war . "
" exactly my idea , <name> . "
" semmel is a thoroughly bad egg , " came from <name> grandon .
" he <name> lie out of his troubles if he can possibly do so . "
" it <name> be a shame if we do n't find the columbia again , " went on <name> .
" think of those rascals taking her to <unk> and getting their share of the prize money !
it makes me sick ! "
" captain <unk> tells me that other japanese warships are in this vicinity , " said captain ponsberry .
" they may fall in with the schooner even if we do n't .
but what they <name> do with her , in that case , there is no telling .
they might claim her as a prize also , and if they did , i'd have some trouble in getting my property back . "
what the japanese captain had said was true .
in order to counteract the doings of the russian squadron which was <unk> the northern and eastern coasts of japan , the mikado had sent out a flying squadron of six or seven vessels , all of which , though not large , had good sailing powers .
owing to the heavy mists , the flying squadron became separated , and two of the vessels fell in with the pocastra , as already described .
of the other ships some proceeded up the coast to <unk> and caught two russian <unk> loaded with coal and another ship carrying steel rails for the <unk> railroad .
the remainder of the squadron put further to sea , and on the fourth day out caught sight of two russian steamers loaded with munitions of war .
a <name> ensued , lasting three days , and several shots were exchanged at long range .
but a mist , coming up one night , put an end to the <name> , and chagrined to think that the enemy had given them the slip after all , the japanese turned back once more , to look for the other vessels of the flying squadron .
chapter xvii the <unk> of the " columbia " " we are in for another storm ! "
it was <name> who made the remark .
he was in one of the tops with <name> , gazing anxiously to the westward , where the black clouds were beginning to pile up .
" right you are , lad  and it 's going to be a heavy one , unless i miss my guess . "
the storm broke half an hour later , and the wind and rain were so furious that our friends were glad to leave the top and go below .
but some of the japanese sailors did not appear to mind the lashing of the elements and remained on deck as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring .
" these chaps beat me ! "
said <name> .
" they are certainly as tough as pine knots .
i never saw their equal . "
" i 'm beginning to think that the japanese are a wonderful nation , " put in <name> grandon , seriously .
" i used to look at them as something like the chinese .
but there is a wide difference between them and the chinks . "
" a chinaman is n't in it alongside of a japanese , " came from captain ponsberry .
" the japanese are up-to-date and very progressive ; the chinese are about a hundred years behind the times . "
the storm continued for the best part of half a day .
there was but little thunder and lightning , but the wind blew a perfect <name> .
yet even the pocastra did not seem to mind the wind , and all three of the warships proceeded on their way at only a slightly reduced rate of speed .
" such a <name> as this <name> play havoc with the sailing vessels , " said <name> .
" i wonder how the old columbia is making out ? "
" i was thinking that same , " rejoined captain ponsberry .
" to tell the truth , i 'd rather have her go to the bottom than see her taken to a russian port as a prize . "
when the storm cleared away , <name> was one of the first to go on deck , to get a whiff of " washed air , " as he called it .
the others followed .
" i see a sail ! "
cried the youth , a moment later , and at that instant came a cry from the lookout .
far to the eastward was a sailing vessel flying a signal of distress .
" she looks familiar to me ! "
ejaculated captain ponsberry , and ran to get captain <unk> 's glass .
one glance through the instrument was enough .
" the columbia ! "
" are you sure ? "
cried <name> .
" she certainly is the columbia , " said <name> grandon , after a look through the glass .
" she has lost her fore topmast and part of her bowsprit . "
" and a part of the stern rail is gone , " added <name> , after he too had used the glass .
" let us tell captain <unk> , " he added , starting to go below .
the news that the columbia was in sight was soon circulated throughout the ship , and captain <unk> at once <unk> to the other warships that he was going to her assistance .
then the <unk> <unk> steamed away on her new course .
as they <name> closer to the schooner they could see that the storm had treated the gallant old ship roughly enough .
many of the sails were in ribbons , and not only the fore topmast but also half a dozen of the spars were gone .
one end of the forecastle was stove in , and a part of the stern was a wreck .
" this is the worst yet ! "
cried <name> .
" they must have caught more of the <name> than we did . "
" they did n't know how to handle her , that 's the reason of it , " came from captain ponsberry .
" we have taken her through a worse blow than that ; eh , <name> ? "
" i think so , " answered the second mate .
as soon as the japanese warship was close enough a boat was lowered and an officer went aboard of the schooner , followed by several of his crew and captain ponsberry , grandon , and <name> .
the russians having the schooner in charge were meek enough .
as a matter of fact the <name> had <unk> them , and all had imagined they were surely going to the bottom of the sea .
they did not like it to find themselves in the hands of the enemy and were astonished when they learned that the pocastra had been captured .
" it was a fearful storm , " said the russian officer who was in charge .
" several times i fancied the masts would all go by the board .
i shall never want another such experience .
one man was washed overboard and several were badly hurt by the wrecking of the forecastle . "
" were any of my former men injured ? "
asked captain ponsberry .
" it was my fellow countryman , ostag semmel , who was swept overboard and drowned , " answered the russian officer .
" semmel ! "
ejaculated <name> .
he <name> a long breath and his hatred of the man died all in an instant .
" poor chap !
that was rough on him ! "
" it certainly was rough , " answered captain ponsberry .
" and what of the others ? "
" both peterson and shamhaven were hurt , but not seriously .
they are below resting , " was the answer .
it was found that some of the seams of the schooner had opened but that no alarming quantity of water was running into the well .
the russians were asked to surrender as prisoners of war and this they did willingly , and were transferred to the japanese warship .
then captain ponsberry was asked if he wished to take charge of the columbia again .
" <name> a duck swim ! "
he cried .
" of course i want to take charge .
hasn't she always been my ship ?
and my crew <name> want to go with me , i know . "
" but the wreckage   " began captain <unk> .
" i 'll attend to that , sir ,  do n't you worry .
only give me back my ship , that 's all i ask . "
" it shall be as you say , captain ponsberry .
but when you get to nagasaki you <name> have to settle matters with the japanese government .
it is , all told , a rather peculiar case .
in one way , she is now a japanese prize of war , and in another way she is not . "
" i understand , and the courts <name> have to settle the tangle , sir .
i'll do what is fair , and i know the richmond importing company <name> do the same . "
" then you can go aboard of the ship as soon as you please . "
" thank you very much . "
captain ponsberry had returned to the warship for just this talk , and now he lost no time in getting back to the columbia , taking with him all his crew , including cal <name> , who was just about able to get around once more .
" hurrah ! "
cried <name> , " this seems like home once more , does n't it ? "
" that 's what it does , " answered <name> .
" but there is plenty of work ahead , i can tell you that , lad . "
" i do n't care  work <name> help to pass the time . "
when peterson and shamhaven saw captain ponsberry they did not know what to say .
the loss of their leader , semmel , had humbled them greatly .
" i 'm not going to say much to you , seeing as how both of you are hurt , " said the master of the columbia , briefly .
" but understand , i want no nonsense from either of you . "
" i 'll do all i can to assist you , captain , " said shamhaven , humbly .
" all i want is another chance . "
" which you 'll not get from me , " was the quick rejoinder .
" i know you thoroughly , shamhaven , and i am done with you .
you and peterson aided the russians and you can now consider yourselves under arrest .
when we get into port i 'm going to hand you over to the japanese authorities . "
both of the <unk> wanted to argue , but the captain would not listen .
their hurts were inspected and they were told that they would be allowed three days in which to <unk> , after which they would have to do their share of duty .
" i do n't like this , " growled shamhaven , after the interview was over .
" peterson , we are in it deeper than ever . "
" dat is so , " was the answer , with a scowl .
" vell , ve not put up mit him , hey ?
maybe , ven we git near shore , we run avay , shamhaven . "
" yes , if we can get the chance .
but i do n't know where you are going to run to  especially if you have n't any money . "
" ve git money . "
" from where ? "
" i to n't know <name> yet , no , but ve git him , yes .
captain ponsberry must haf some , and <name> <name> <name> , too .
<unk> i see <name> mit a money pelt vot haf some gold in him , yes . "
" a money belt with gold ?
you must be dreaming . "
" no , i see him mit mine two eyes .
he count der gold .
he haf more as dirty pieces . "
" that is worth remembering , " answered shamhaven .
and he began to speculate upon what he could do in japan if he was free and had a money belt full of gold .
that <name> had a money belt was true .
he had purchased it several years before , while on shore duty in the philippines .
he was a saving fellow and found the belt useful in which to place his wages and the money which he occasionally received from home .
strange as it may seem , the belt had not been taken away from him by the russians , and it now contained nearly three hundred dollars .
the money was mostly in gold ,  for he had found that gold could be used no matter where he went .
chapter xviii a clever ruse as soon as captain ponsberry was in charge of the columbia once more he set about without delay to put the schooner in proper condition for the run to nagasaki .
the <unk> foremast was allowed to remain as it was , but a temporary bowsprit was set into place , and the damage to the forecastle and to the stern repaired .
a temporary rail was also nailed up , so that there might be no danger of anybody slipping overboard .
in all this work the sailors and the ship 's carpenter did their best , and the captain and his mates helped .
sails were also sewed up , or replaced , and inside of forty-eight hours the old columbia was once more on her way .
the water taken aboard was pumped out , and the pumps were kept going two hours each morning and two hours each afternoon .
" she <name> do now , " said the captain , after the heaviest of the work was over .
" but when we reach nagasaki i 'll have to put her in the dock for regular repairs .
i should n't dare to take her to manila or to san <name> in such a condition . "
" it <name> take a long time to have the repairs made in japan , " said <name> .
" all the <unk> are busy on government work . "
" true , lad , but that can not be helped .
the law would not allow me to sign a crew with a ship that was not <unk> . "
" then we 'll have a long <unk> when we reach nagasaki . "
" exactly , <name> .
but i <name> n't keep you .
if you want to go elsewhere   " " not on another sailing vessel , captain ponsberry .
but you know how it is with <name> striker and myself .
ever since we were in our own navy we have had a hankering after warships , and   " " and you think of joining the japanese navy ? "
put in the master of the schooner , quickly .
" that 's it .
you know how i spoke of joining the army with <name> and <name> . "
" to be sure  and i told you i could n't spare you . "
" but now , if you have n't any use for me any longer   " " why , <name> , if you want to fight for japan , go ahead and fight ! "
ejaculated captain ponsberry .
" i do n't blame you .
i 'd fight myself if i was a younger man and had n't any obligations on my shoulders .
i suppose <name> is doing great things in the army and you 'd like to match him in the navy , eh ? "
" if i join the navy i 'll do my best . "
" <name> striker go with you ? "
" oh , yes , <name> and i always go together , if we can .
he was my chum when we fought under <name> and he has been my chum ever since . "
" and a good fellow , too , <name>  a man with a heart of gold .
if it wasn't that you and <name> grandon were with me , i should have made him a mate long ago . "
" i do n't doubt that , sir  and he is worthy of it . "
<name> paused for a moment .
" of course , i do n't know if they want any of us in the navy . "
" did n't you tell me before that they had several men you had met while under <name> and some your brother <name> had met while fighting in cuban waters ? "
" yes , but that was some time ago . "
" if they took those chaps then it 's likely they <name> take you now  unless , of course , they have all the men they want  which i doubt . "
" we shall not go as ordinary jackies .
<name> got a commission as a captain , and <name> thinks he might go as a gunner and i might go as an assistant gunner .
we occupied those positions before we left our navy . "
" then i should certainly strike for the positions .
they may need gunners even if they do n't need common seamen , " responded captain ponsberry .
as fortune would have it , the run to nagasaki was made without incident worthy of special mention .
once there was a scare on board , as the water in the well hole increased with alarming rapidity .
but the new leak was discovered in time , and the ship 's carpenter had little difficulty in repairing it .
they also sighted a vessel they thought might be a russian warship , but she proved instead to be a japanese coastwise freighter , carrying lumber from one port to another on the northern coast of japan .
as the columbia <name> closer to nagasaki both peterson and shamhaven grew more anxious over what was to become of them .
neither desired a term in a japanese prison , and both wondered what sort of a charge captain ponsberry and the captain of the japanese warship would prefer against them .
so far captain ponsberry had allowed them their <name> , but through the talk of a couple of sailors they presently learned that they were to be cast into the ship 's brig and placed under guard as soon as the schooner dropped anchor .
" this looks black for us , " said shamhaven , moodily .
" i wish we were out of it . "
" i haf a plan got , yes , " answered peterson .
" to get away ? "
the other nodded .
" then let me hear the plan by all means , peterson . "
" it vos  vot you call him  risky , yes .
maype ve get shot  you no like him , no ? "
" of course i do n't want to get shot .
but what is your plan ? "
" so soon like de ship come up by der harbor we <unk> our chances an' <unk> <unk> , yes . "
" and swim ashore ? "
" maype ve <unk> by some udder <unk> , yes .
of ve got money we go to leetle <unk>  gif jap <unk> money to take us avay , you see now ? "
" you mean to watch for some small japanese boat  a <unk> , eh ?
and bribe the boatman to take us to some place of safety ? "
" you got him now , yes . "
" that 's good enough if we can find the <unk> and get the money with which to do the bribing . "
" captain ponsberry got money  an ' <name> he got money pelt , like i told you . "
" oh , i have n't forgotten about that money belt , " returned shamhaven .
" and i would n't mind taking it if i could get my hands on it .
but <name> must wear it most of the time . "
" i t'ink he not put him on by der night dime , no . "
" what do you know about captain ponsberry 's money ? "
" he got money in a leetle <unk>  i see him <unk> . "
" how much do you think ? "
at this peterson shrugged his shoulders .
" no can tell dat  maype a thousand dollars . "
there was a pause , and shamhaven <name> a long breath .
" one thing is certain , " he resumed .
" i do n't intend to go to a japanese prison , or an american prison either , if i can help it , and if we cut loose here in a strange country we are bound to need more or less money with which to get along .
without money a fellow ca n't do a thing in a strange country . "
" we git money  chust you <unk> , " said peterson .
at last the columbia came into sight of the shipping of nagasaki .
but it was now dark , and a heavy fog was hanging over the harbor , so it was impossible to make the proper landing before the next day .
they came to anchor and the necessary lights were <name> out .
" this is our chance , " said shamhaven .
" it is now or never ! "
he had heard that peterson and himself were to be made close prisoners directly after supper .
he watched his chance and when nobody was looking motioned his confederate to leave the forecastle and steal silently toward the stern of the ship .
each carried a block of wood , to which was attached a bit of iron , to make it sink from sight .
" now then ! "
whispered shamhaven , and threw the block he carried overboard .
it struck the water with a loud splash , and the block carried by peterson immediately followed .
" hullo , what 's that ? "
came in the voice of <name> grandon .
" who threw something overboard ? "
" sounded like somebody jumping into the water , " replied captain ponsberry , who was on deck with the first mate .
an examination was made , but in the fog and darkness nothing could be discovered .
" it was mighty queer , " was grandon 's comment .
" somebody must have done it . "
" where are shamhaven and peterson ? "
" in the forecastle , i suppose .
do you think   " " i do n't know what to think .
see if they are there . "
at once <name> grandon ran off , and made a tour not only of the forecastle but also of the forward deck .
he called the men 's names several times , and others quickly joined in the hunt .
" they are gone ! "
he ejaculated , running back to where captain ponsberry stood .
" gone ?
then it must have been them jumping overboard that we heard ! "
" like as not  and they are a good bit away from the schooner by this time . "
" bring a lantern and we 'll take a look around . "
a lantern was brought , and a few minutes later a small boat was lowered , manned by <name> and three other sailors .
captain ponsberry went with them , and the <unk> remained out the best part of an hour .
" they 've given us the slip clean and clear , " declared the master of the columbia , on returning .
" it was a risky thing to undertake in such weather as this . "
" yes , and for all we know they may be at the bottom of the harbor , " answered <name> grandon .
" which place might be jest what they deserve , " grumbled <name> striker , as he helped to stow away the small boat once more .
chapter xix the disappearance of the enemy as soon as peterson and shamhaven threw the blocks of wood overboard they darted for the companionway of the schooner and crept noiselessly down to the cabin .
the apartment was deserted , and the swinging lamp over the center table was turned low .
on the table rested several charts which captain ponsberry had been consulting before joining <name> grandon on deck .
it was <name> 's watch below and he was improving the time by taking a <unk> nap .
he lay on the berth in his stateroom , with the door wide open to admit the fresh air .
" make no noise ! "
whispered shamhaven .
" if we are discovered the jig is up with us . "
" <name> is here , yes ? "
came from peterson .
" <unk> !
yes  over in yonder stateroom . "
they closed the door leading to the companionway and then tiptoed their way to where <name> lay .
" more than likely he keeps his money belt under his pillow when he sleeps , " said shamhaven .
" wait till i find out . "
he shoved his hand under the <unk> with caution and presently his fingers came into contact with a strip of leather and chamois .
he pulled on it gently , but it refused to budge .
" lift his head a little , " he said , and peterson started to do as requested .
but the movement , gentle as it was , caused <name> to open his eyes .
" wha  what are you doing here ? "
stammered the young second mate , when , waiting for no more words , peterson clapped a dirty hand over his mouth .
" keep still , you !
if you no keep still i hit you good , yes ! "
" confound the luck , " muttered shamhaven .
" i did n't want him to know what we were up to . "
<name> began to struggle and with an effort threw aside the hand over his mouth .
" <name>  let up ! "
he spluttered .
" i want you   help ! "
" shut up ! "
cried shamhaven , fiercely , and struck him a swinging blow in the <name> .
another blow from peterson followed , and then , with flashing lights darting through his <name> , <name> lost consciousness .
both men bent over him to see if he would move .
when he lay as still as if dead they looked at each other with satisfaction .
" he wo n't bother us any more  at least , not for awhile , " was <unk> comment .
" quick , de money belt ! "
came from peterson , and as he raised up <unk> head , shamhaven secured it and stowed it away in the bosom of his shirt .
" you no keep him ! "
he went on , in alarm , showing that he did not trust his companion in crime .
" we 'll divide up afterwards , " said shamhaven , briefly .
" now to locate the captain 's little pile . "
both tiptoed their way into captain ponsberry 's stateroom .
here there was a small safe , with the door closed .
" a safe , eh ? "
said shamhaven .
" wonder if we can open it ? "
he knelt down and tried to work the combination lock .
the safe was old and out of order and the captain had had the combination lock made as simple as possible in consequence .
soon there came a click , followed by another , and the bolts shot back .
" luck is with us ! "
cried shamhaven .
" dare is de leetle <unk> , " came from peterson , and reaching into the safe he <name> the article forth .
there was a slip string at the top which he pulled apart .
" gold ! "
he cried .
" see  dirty  forty <unk> of gold ! "
and then he shut the bag again , and placed it into his own shirt bosom .
" remember , half of that is mine , " came sharply from shamhaven .
he fancied there might be more in the bag than in the money belt .
" yes ,  an ' haf de <unk> money ist mine , yes , " returned peterson .
" right you are , peterson .
now to get away from the ship . "
" let us lock <name> in de stateroom first . "
" a good idea ! "
the door was closed and locked .
<name> still lay unconscious and there was no telling how soon he would come to his senses .
they heard the tramping on the deck and the departure of the small boat .
now those in the boat came back and the search for the missing men came to an end .
with the <unk> of a pair of cats , the evildoers crept up the companionway once more .
nobody was in sight , and they crawled rather than walked to the rail of the schooner .
both were good swimmers and not afraid to trust themselves to reach some other shipping in the harbor .
yet as an extra precaution each provided himself with a life-preserver .
" are you ready , peterson ? "
" yes . "
" then over we go . "
a small rope was handy , and lowering this , each slid along it into the waters of the harbor .
then they struck out swiftly but silently ; and in a few minutes the fog and darkness hid them completely from view .
it was the best part of an hour before <name> returned to his senses .
his head ached as if ready to split open and for several minutes he could not remember where he was or what had occurred .
" oh , my head ! "
he groaned .
" oh ! "
and he turned over and tried to sit up , with the result that he pitched out on the floor of the stateroom .
this aroused him and he got up as quickly as he could .
" those rascals attacked me ! "
he muttered .
" they struck me over the head !
i remember now !
oh , how my head spins ,  just as if i was in a <unk> !
i wonder   " he dropped on the berth and snatched away the pillow .
one glance was sufficient to show him how he had been robbed .
" that 's why they attacked me ! "
he cried .
" wonder where they are now ?
perhaps they ran away from the ship ! "
leaping up again he stepped to the door , and finding it locked , began to pound away lustily , at the same time yelling at the top of his lungs .
in a few minutes this brought down captain ponsberry , followed by <name> , who had been told to come along , the captain fearing that something had gone wrong .
" what 's up here ? "
demanded captain ponsberry as he flung open the door .
" where are they ? "
came the <unk> from <name> .
" they ?
who ? "
" peterson and shamhaven ? "
" gone  slid away in the fog . "
" they have robbed me ! "
" you do n't say ! "
ejaculated the master of the columbia .
" you are sure ? "
he went on .
" yes .
my money belt is gone .
they came while i was asleep , and when i woke up both hit me ,  and i do n't know what happened after that .
i just came to my senses and found myself locked in . "
" the villains ! "
burst in <name> .
" those chaps ought to be swung up to a <unk> ! "
the captain listened to <name> 's story and then was prompted to take a look around the other staterooms .
as a result he speedily discovered that the safe had been tampered with and that his own money was gone .
" they are worse rascals than i thought them , " said captain ponsberry , bitterly .
" i am sorry that i did not make an example of them from the start . "
there was a good deal of speculation concerning what had become of shamhaven and peterson , and another search was instituted , lasting until the following day , but not a single trace of the evildoers could be found .
" well , i am out the whole of my savings , " said <name> to <name> .
" it 's a shame , lad , " replied the yankee tar .
" but if you need ready cash do n't fail to draw on me .
as long as i have a shot in the locker half on it is yours . "
" thank you , <name> ; i know you 'd say that .
you 're the proper kind of a friend to have . "
" avast , <name> , with your compliments .
would n't you do the same fer me ? "
" indeed i would ! "
" then it ai n't worth talkin ' about .
jest the same , i <name> we run into them rascals some day ; do n't you ? "
" i do .
but more than likely they 'll give the columbia and us a wide berth after this , " returned <name> .
chapter xx <name> before admiral togo as soon as the columbia could make the proper landing , captain ponsberry went ashore and reported his arrival to the authorities , and also reported the escape of shamhaven and peterson .
the authorities had already heard of the capture of the columbia from the russians , and said that the schooner would have to remain at nagasaki until the whole case could be adjusted .
the japanese were inclined to favor both the richmond importing company and the owners of the vessel , so it was not likely that our friends would lose much in the end .
in the meantime the columbia could be put in a <unk> and given the <unk> that she needed .
" we shall do all we can to locate shamhaven and peterson and get back your money , " said an official of the secret service department .
but his hands were so full with other matters of greater importance that little attention was paid to the disappearance of the two rascals .
" well , this <name> tie me up at nagasaki for some time to come , " said captain ponsberry to <name> , on the third day after arriving at the japanese port .
" which means , i suppose , that i can join the japanese navy if i wish , " returned the young second mate , quickly .
" i do n't want to force you to leave the ship , lad .
but you said   " " i know , captain ponsberry , and i am glad of the chance to get away .
<name> and i have talked it over once more , and yesterday we met a gunner named <name> <name>  he served on the brooklyn at the time <name> did .
he is now a gun captain on board of admiral togo 's flagship , and he is almost certain he can get us good positions .
he says gunners and gunners ' assistants are just now badly needed . "
" then go by all means , <name> , and make even a bigger record for yourself than your brother <name> is making in the army .
perhaps , when this war is over , you 'll come back to the old columbia , eh ? "
" more than likely , and i guess <name> striker <name> come , too . "
what <name> had said about meeting <name> <name> was true .
as readers of a story of mine entitled " fighting in cuban waters " know , <name> had been a gun captain under commodore schley , and as such had become fairly well acquainted with <name> <name> and had also heard of <name> , who was at that time serving under admiral <name> at manila .
a detail from admiral togo 's flagship had been sent ashore at nagasaki , and <name> and <name> , as they walked through the streets , had met several of these men .
hearing two of them speaking english they had halted the pair ; and introductions had followed .
" so you are <name> <name> , " said <name> <name> .
" any relation to <name> <name> that once served on the u. s. cruiser brooklyn ? "
" <name> is my brother , " replied <name> , quickly .
" oh , so you are the chap that was cast away in the pacific and picked up by admiral <name> 's flagship , eh ? "
" the same , and this is the friend who was with me , <name> striker . "
" glad to know ye both . "
<name> <name> shook hands .
" this is my friend , <name> <name>  he hails from san <name> and is a gunner 's mate with me .
what are you doing in this corner of the earth ? "
a long talk followed , in which <name> and <name> told their story , and <name> <name> and his friend related how they had come to join the japanese navy .
" it 's this way , " said <name> .
" i 've got the fighting blood in my veins and it wo n't come out .
as soon as this war broke out , i cut sticks from 'frisco with <name> and we comes to tokio .
there i met another american who was in the navy here , and it was n't two days before we were booked for admiral togo 's flagship .
we 've been down to port <name> twice , and i reckon we 'll go again before long . "
" perhaps we 'll go up to <unk> next time , " came from <name> <name> .
" i 've heard something of <unk> that russian port . "
<name> and <name> had a couple of hours to themselves and <name> and <name> invited them over to the columbia .
in return they were asked to come over to admiral togo 's flagship , the gunners having the privilege of bringing their friends aboard during the brief stay in nagasaki harbor .
" you can come aboard to-morrow , " said <name> <name> .
" they have an inspection and drill , and you can see how they do it in the japanese navy  not but what it 's a good bit like it 's done on uncle sam's warships . "
<name> and <name> were very willing to go aboard of the japanese warship , and were taken out by <name> the next day , and introduced to several gunners and others who could speak a little english .
they were also taken before the head gunner , who took them to the commander of the warship .
" they both served under admiral <name> at manila , " said the head gunner , and this made the commander smile quietly as he shook hands and told them to make themselves at home .
" everything is as clean as a whistle , " was <name> 's comment , as they walked around the forward part of the warship and through the gun decks .
" the japs certainly know how to take care of things .
<name> , just look at how the <unk> shines ! "
" that 's the way it ought to be , " was the yankee tar 's reply .
" no <unk> , an ' i 'm glad on it .
i love a clean ship above all things . "
<name> <name> and <name> <name> were enthusiastic over the gun they commanded and explained how it worked .
it was certainly an effective weapon and <name> and <name> were thoroughly interested .
" i could handle sech a gun myself , " said <name> .
" an ' do some damage , too ; eh , <name> ? "
" anyway , i 'd like to try it , " returned the youth .
orders were now being issued for the inspection and drill , and presently nearly all on board of the flagship hurried to the main deck .
here the marines were drawn up in long lines , with the officers in their proper places .
the sailors and gunners were also at hand , each <unk> out in his best , for inspection by an admiral on any warship means a great deal .
presently admiral togo appeared , followed by several other naval officers of lesser rank .
he was in full dress , with many decorations on his breast , and carried his sword .
he proved to be a man well along in years , with a round face , and small mustache and goatee .
" he looks like a fighter ! "
whispered <name> .
" true for you , lad , " returned <name> .
" an ' i reckon he knows how to handle men . "
what our friends said about admiral togo was true .
he was a fighter and a born leader of men .
when the naval academy of japan was inaugurated he was one of the first graduates , and he was sent by the government to complete his nautical education in england , where , during 1873 and 1874 , he served on the training ship worcester , making a record for himself as a first-class pupil in every respect .
on returning home togo <unk>  to use his full name  found a great task confronting his people .
they were becoming civilized as we term civilization and needed a modern navy .
he set to work with <unk> and vigor , and then and there laid the foundation of that navy which is to-day known as one of the most effective in the world .
the navy had scarcely come into existence when there came rumors of war with <name> .
the rumors grew , and <name> became more and more hateful toward the japanese .
to the outside world it looked as if <name> , with her vast territory and her immense number of people , would swallow up the sons of <unk> bodily .
at last it was discovered that <name> was transporting troops with which to begin the war .
togo waited for no instructions from his home government .
he went at the chinese with vigor .
the war followed , and after a number of thrilling contests the japanese were victorious , and admiral togo emerged from the struggle covered with <name> .
" he is the man to lead us to victory against the russians ! "
was the cry throughout the navy , when war was declared between russia and japan , and how he sent his ships to port <name> and other places , and what effective work was done by them , has already been related .
in the whole of the japanese navy , to serve on the admiral 's flagship , the <unk> , was considered a great honor .
the inspection and drill were exceedingly interesting to <name> and <name> , and they watched both with close attention .
after it was over admiral togo addressed the men briefly and then turned to the commander of the ship .
" see , he is pointing to us ! "
whispered <name> .
" <name> me if i do n't think he is talking about us to the captain ! "
" an officer is coming , " replied <name> , and a moment later one of the admiral 's staff came hurrying to them .
" are you the two americans who served under admiral <name> at manila ? "
questioned the staff officer .
" we are , " answered <name> .
" admiral togo wishes you to come to him . "
" oh , <name> , we are going to be presented to the admiral ! "
cried <name> .
" great pewter ! "
groaned the yankee tar .
" i did n't expect this nohow .
but i do n't care , " he added , bracing up .
" he ai n't no bigger nor <name> .
come along . "
he followed the staff officer and <name> did the same .
they felt that the eyes of many of the sailors and marines were on them , and stepped out as firmly as possible .
coming up to the admiral , they took off their caps and saluted .
admiral togo surveyed the two americans with interest .
he had heard how they had come to serve under <name> at manila and he smiled pleasantly as he held out his hand , first to <name> and then to <name> .
" let me give you a welcome , my men , " said he .
" i have been told your story .
i <name> this visit to my ship has interested you . "
" very much , sir , " answered <name> .
" i liked the drill , sir , " answered <name> , with a smile .
" it was fine .
and everything is so clean !
really , i do n't think it could be cleaner ! "
at this admiral togo smiled again .
" that is a compliment ,  since it comes from one who has served in the american navy . "
he then asked them to remain where they were , while some of the men went through an exercise with their cutlasses .
there was also a gun drill , and they were asked to show how they had handled a gun during the battle of manila bay .
" you are well drilled , i can see that , " said the admiral , on dismissing them .
" they tell me you think of entering our navy .
if you wish to do so i think likely we can find suitable openings for you . "
chapter xxi letters of interest the <unk> of <name> and <name> striker into the japanese navy came sooner than anticipated .
a new warship was being fitted out at a harbor some forty miles from nagasaki , and <name> <name> and <name> <name> were transferred to this .
two new gun crews were badly needed on the new ship , and inside of forty-eight hours our friends had signed the muster roll and were put into training , under <name> .
the positions occupied were those of gunner and gunner 's mate .
" hurrah for <unk> ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically .
" <name> , after this we have got to learn to yell <unk> !  in true japanese style . "
" this gun is a beauty , " replied the yankee tar , as he looked the piece over .
" i reckon as i can make her do considerable damage if i get the chance . "
" and i 'll help all i can , " said <name> .
" wo n't <name> and <name> be surprised when they hear of this ? "
he added .
" they might know you 'd do something of the sort . "
" that 's so , too .
by the way , i 'm going up to the post-office to-day and see if there are any letters . "
much to the satisfaction of our friends they found over a score of men on the warship who could speak english .
some , of course , could speak but little , yet they could make themselves understood .
on the other hand , both <name> and <name> began to pick up the japanese language remarkably fast .
" if we keep at this for six months we 'll be regular japanese , " said the youth .
" it 's not so hard as i thought it would be . "
they found the discipline on the warship very strict and were called on to " toe the <name> " continually .
yet all the officers were as considerate as they were firm , so there was little of hardship .
when <name> called at the post-office for letters he found two good-sized epistles awaiting him .
one was from his brother <name> , and ran , in part , as follows : " there is nothing particularly new in this part of the globe .
i am doing very well in my new business and it looks now as if i should make a big thing of it .
i rather think i am more cut out for work on land than for life on shipboard , although i do n't regret the time i spent in the navy .
" uncle job is feeling very well these days and is building a new wing to the old house  going to put in a library of good books he tells me .
he is as dear an old chap now as anybody would want for an uncle .
" i suppose you <name> hear from <name> and <name> .
i am expecting a letter every day .
it 's queer you did n't go with them , but i suppose the old columbia with her crew suits you better . "
" i am glad everything is all right at home , " thought <name> , as he finished reading the communication .
" a new wing to the house , eh ?
uncle job must be spreading himself .
reckon he has found out there is something more to live for in this world than mere money . "
the second letter was from <name> , as he could tell by the handwriting .
it had been on the way a long time and had been sent to half a dozen places , including manila .
there was a great deal about life in the japanese army , and also a full description of the capture of <unk> .
<name> then continued : " we are now on guard a few miles outside of the city .
our camp stretches for many miles , and we are doing all in our power to strengthen our position .
what the next move <name> be there is no telling .
one report is , that our particular command <name> help to <name> the russians to <unk> , while another report has it that we are to march southward , to aid in the attempt to take port <name> .
" i have already told you what trouble <name> had with that rascally russian merchant , <name> snokoff , and with <unk> confederate , captain barusky , of the russian army .
well , at <unk> we found snokoff disguised as a chinaman , and <name> made the fellow pay over all that was coming to him for the richmond importing company .
in the attempt to capture snokoff , <name> shot him in the leg .
it was only a slight wound , but the russian was as mad as a hornet , and he vowed he would get square some time .
he is now in the hospital here , but they expect to let him leave in a few days .
he really ought to be put under arrest , but as he has paid up the money he owed , there does n't seem to be any way of holding him .
it 's out of the question to go to court with the case .
i helped <name> to put snokoff under guard , and he is as angry at me as he is at <name> .
i do n't know if he <name> dare to do anything or not , but both of us are keeping our eyes open . "
<name> read this letter twice before he stowed it away .
he was always interested in war news and he thought the description of the great battle of <unk> very realistic .
he shook his curly head when he thought of <name> snokoff .
" he must be an underhanded rascal if ever there was one , " he mused .
" and to think he disguised himself as a chinaman !
i 'll wager <name> thought it a fine thing to expose him and make him pay up .
but he and <name> had better look out , or snokoff and that captain barusky may cause them a lot of trouble . "
<name> had an hour to himself , and he spent the time in answering both letters , telling briefly what had happened to him since the trip to manila and how he and <name> were now in service on board of the japanese warship shohirika .
he added that he liked the position of <unk> mate very much , and that he meant to make a record for himself if given the opportunity to do so .
he also told about the doings of shamhaven and peterson , and said he hoped to bring them to justice , although he realized that looking for them was as bad as " looking for a <name> on the ocean bottom . "
the letters finished , he addressed and posted them , and then he and <name> took a short stroll through nagasaki , past the many curious shops , and the fine residences .
some of the shop windows displayed flaring war pictures , done in glaring colors ,  all telling of tremendous japanese victories on land and sea .
" they certainly believe in tooting their own horn , " said <name> , with a laugh over one of the pictures .
" just see this one , <name>  one japanese officer mowing down three russians with his sword ! "
" they ai n't no worse nor we had at home during the spanish war , lad .
i know one picture i see o ' a rough rider riding down half a dozen spanish soldiers .
an ' the truth o ' the matter is , them rough riders did n't have no horses at all but fought on foot ! "
" you 're right , <name> .
we 'll have to put all such pictures down as freaks of the artist 's imagination .
but i guess i know why some of them are put out  to draw the young fellows into the army and navy . "
" right ye are .
some fellers seeing a picture like that want to march to <name> right off ,  an ' so they go an ' enlist .
when it comes to <unk> an ' black coffee   " " hold on , <name> .
remember you are in japan .
here it is rice and tea . "
" so it is , <name> .
say , but i had to laugh yesterday , when i see some of them jackies on board o ' our ship gettin ' out their <unk> with tea . "
" it did look funny .
but they do the same thing in the army , so i have been told .
they can make the japanese soldier and sailor do everything as we do it but give up his tea . "
" well , i reckon tea is better nor rum . "
" certainly it is ,  and if i were an officer i 'd let them have all the tea they wanted  if they would fight any better for it . "
" those russian sailors and soldiers drink an awful lot of <unk> .
i should think they would try to stop that .
a <unk> sailor or soldier is n't of any account . "
" they are so used to having it , i 've been told , that to stop it would bring on a regular mutiny .
it 's hard to break off using a thing when you are used to it . "
" right ye are , lad ; a habit if it ai n't proper is something awful . "
all was bustle throughout nagasaki , for several regiments of soldiers had come in , bound for some transports which were to take them to <unk> .
banners were flying everywhere , and from a distance came the music of a band .
" wonder how soon we <name> leave , " said <name> , when he and his old friend were returning to the warship .
" now that we have enlisted , i 'd like to see some fighting . "
" maybe we 'll get more fighting than we want , lad .
but i 'd like to get into it myself , " continued the yankee gunner , with a grin .
two days more were spent at nagasaki , and then , on a clear morning , the shohirika left the harbor and steamed off in company with two sister ships .
they were to join a squadron bound for the western coast of <unk> , but where they were to go after that there was no telling .
captain ponsberry came to see <name> and <name> off .
" take good care of yourselves , " said the master of the columbia .
" an ' teach them russians the lesson they deserve . "
" we expect to do our duty , " answered <name> .
life on the japanese warship proved to be very much like life in the american navy .
there were hours set apart for various drills and exercises .
each day they had to go through the movements of handling the gun , fighting with cutlasses , putting out a fire , and manning the small boats .
they also had to keep their ditty bags and grass <unk> in good order , also their eating utensils , and each had to do his share of cleaning up .
twice a week the ship 's surgeon examined each man , to see that he was perfectly healthy .
" i like this keeping things clean , " said <name> .
" it is bound to make for good health . "
" they tell me that japanese sailors and soldiers are among the <unk> in the world , " answered <name> .
in a few days the southern point of <unk> was passed and the bow of the warship was pointed toward the eastern coast of <unk> .
they were now getting close to the <unk> and the lookout was constantly watching for the appearance of the ships of the enemy .
" we 'll have a fight before very long  i can feel it in my bones , " declared <name> .
and he was right ; but before telling of that contest , and what surprising results it led to , we shall have to tell of something else which occurred , to delight <name> exceedingly .
chapter xxii a meeting and a plot " some japanese transports are coming up , " said <name> , two days later .
" six of them , and they are crowded to the rails with soldiers . "
" i reckon we are to act as an escort to them , " replied <name> .
" they would need an escort , if they fell in with a russian cruiser or two . "
the japanese transports were bound for the coast of <unk> , to land near the village of <unk> .
soon they fell in behind the shohirika ; and then those on the warship knew that they were going to go close to shore , if not to make an actual landing .
a fog came up that night , which made the transports hold off .
but the next day was as bright and clear as before , and about noon land was sighted to the westward .
a patrol boat was sent ahead and came back stating that all was clear for a landing .
then the warships went closer and the transports followed .
on the following day <name> found himself on shore  having been taken along by one of the officers of the ship to interview an english merchant who wished to sell some goods to the japanese .
the officer could speak some english , but wanted somebody along who could help him out in case he could not make himself clearly understood .
the landing was at a small chinese town which was partly in ashes  the russians having tried to burn it down before leaving .
there were a dozen shops , but all were closed and with the windows boarded up .
many of the chinese had fled to the country beyond ; and a japanese regiment was on guard to preserve order and to keep the chunchuses , ( chinese brigands ) from <unk> the place .
" this shows what war <name> do , " thought <name> , as he walked along beside the japanese naval officer .
" i suppose some of the chinese have lost all they possessed  and through no fault of their own either . "
the business with the english merchant was transacted quicker than anticipated , and , not caring to go back to his ship at once , the naval officer visited the camp of the japanese regiment , taking <name> with him .
" we expect another detachment here this afternoon , " said one of the regimental commanders to the naval officer .
" they are to escort a powder train through the mountains . "
a little while later the detachment came in on foot , looking somewhat tired and <name> from a long tramp through an exceedingly rough country .
as the soldiers came to a halt in the public square of the seaport village , <name> uttered a cry of amazement : " <name> ! "
" why , <name> , can it be you ? "
came in a tone of astonishment , and on the instant <name> <name> rushed forward and caught his brother by the hands .
" i must be dreaming ! "
" i guess i 'm dreaming myself ! "
said <name> , and gave his brother a warm hug .
" this beats the dutch !
i thought you were at <unk> .
how are you and how did you get here ? "
" one question at a time , please , " returned <name> , with a happy smile .
" i'm pretty well , although i had a little dose of fever a couple of weeks ago .
our japanese doctor fixed me up in double-quick time .
our command was ordered down here to look after a powder train .
there was a report that either the russians or the chunchuses were going to try to capture it or blow it up .
now , how have you been , and what are you doing here ?
i thought the old columbia was at nagasaki . "
" you want to know as much as i do , <name> . "
there was a pause and both laughed merrily , they felt so happy .
" i 'm as sound as a fiddle .
the columbia is at nagasaki and likely to stay there for some time .
allow me to introduce myself , <name> <name> , gunner 's mate aboard of the mikado 's cruiser shohirika .
my head gunner is <name> striker , <unk> . "
" never ! "
burst from <name> .
" well , this certainly is news .
so you and <name> enlisted ?
have you had any fighting ? "
" not exactly .
but we have seen some rough times , " answered <name> , and then , as soon as <name> could get away for a quiet half-hour , he related his story in detail , just as i have set it down in these pages .
" you are assuredly a lucky chap , <name> , not to be in a russian prison this minute , " said his brother , after the young sailor had finished .
" perhaps i am lucky , <name> .
but it was n't much of luck to have that shamhaven and peterson walk off with my money belt . "
" that is so , but as the amount taken was n't a fortune i should n't worry about it .
i can let you have any money you need . "
" i do n't need any , and , besides , <name> is acting as my banker .
but now tell me about yourself . "
" there is n't very much to tell , outside of what i put down in that letter you received .
as you know , <name> and i are both attached to this command of <name> okopa . "
" where is <name> now ? "
" his company was to bring up the rear .
they 'll be here very shortly .
since the battle of <unk> we have been on special duty , looking after the pack and powder trains , and have seen very little of fighting .
we are <unk> our lines daily , and i think the russians must be doing the same .
i expect some more heavy fighting soon , unless <name> steps in and puts a stop to everything .
the nights are already rather cool , " added <name> .
it was half an hour later that the company under <name> came in , having in their custody two chinese bandits that had tried to steal four horses belonging to two japanese army carts .
" so it 's really you , <name> ! "
cried the young southerner , as he shook hands .
" i 'm mightily glad to see you and see you looking so well .
i suppose <name> has told you all the news . "
" yes , and <name> has been telling some too , " put in <name> .
" he has seen almost as much of the russians as we have . "
and then <name> 's story had to be told again .
" i do n't know where we shall go after we leave here , " said the young sailor .
" are you going back to <unk> ? "
" we do n't know that either .
our orders are to escort the powder train wherever it may be sent , " said <name> .
for two days the japanese warship remained in the harbor of the seaport village and during that time <name> managed to see quite a good deal of <name> and <name> .
he wished he could take them on board of the cruiser , but this was not permitted .
on the third day the shohirika received orders from a dispatch boat which steamed into the harbor , and an hour later the anchors were hove <unk> and she steamed away , carrying <name> and his old yankee friend along .
<name> and <name> stood on a dock watching her departure .
they waved their handkerchiefs at <name> and he waved his own in return .
" i wonder when i 'll see <name> again , " mused <name> .
he felt rather sober at the parting from his younger brother .
" oh , you 'll see him again before long , " answered <name> , trying to be cheerful .
" maybe not .
it all depends upon where that cruiser sails to .
she may go half around the world . "
" more than likely she has been sent to take part in the bombardment of port <name> . "
" do you really think we 'll be sent to port <name> , <name> ? "
" it is not unlikely , <name> . "
the pair watched the cruiser fade away in the distance , and then returned to that part of the village in which <name> okopa 's command had been located .
" by the way , " said <name> , as they hurried along .
" there is one thing i forgot to tell you .
meeting <name> drove it completely out of my mind .
on the way to this village we stopped at a place called <unk> , and there i met , whom do you suppose ? "
" i do n't know , i 'm sure . "
" that rascal <name> snokoff .
he was at his same old tricks  selling things to the inhabitants at exorbitant prices .
when he saw me he shook his fist at me and my men and then ran away and hid . "
" why did n't you root him out , <name> ? "
" what good would it have done ?
besides , i did n't have time .
the fight with the brigands made us lose three hours .
but do you know , i think snokoff has it in for me . "
" yes , and in for me , too , " added <name> .
" he has n't forgotten how i brought along the guard that placed him under temporary arrest . "
there was no time to say more , for the command was to move in half an hour and both of the young captains had to round up their men for that purpose .
the powder train was at rest outside of the village and the men were scattered here , there , and everywhere .
evening found the command to which <name> and <name> belonged ten miles on their way through the mountains .
only the officer in charge of the powder train knew the destination of the precious stores .
the train consisted of eighteen carts , each pulled by four horses .
although none in <name> okopa 's command knew it , the train was followed by a chinaman named <unk> lung , who lived in <unk> , the place where <name> had seen <name> snokoff .
<unk> lung was well known to <name> snokoff and had been asked by the rascally russian to keep his eyes on <name> and on <name> and to report their movements .
he had watched <unk> meeting with <name> and <name> and heard something of what was said and had thus managed to make out that two of the party were brothers .
as the powder train approached <unk> , <unk> lung went ahead to find <name> snokoff .
this was not difficult , as he knew exactly where the latter was hiding .
a conference lasting an hour ensued .
" do as you have promised and you shall have fifty <name> , " said <name> snokoff .
" you <name> not fail to pay ? "
queried <unk> lung .
" by the heads of my ancestors i promise it , " was the rascally <unk> answer .
" 't is enough .
i shall do as i have promised , " returned the chinaman .
and he bowed himself from <name> snokoff 's presence .
left to himself , the rascally russian rubbed his hands gleefully .
" <name> , i trust he is successful ! "
he muttered to himself .
" once pennington and <name> are in the power of us russians i shall show them what it means to insult and degrade a snokoff ! "
chapter xxiii the attack in the dark two days later <name> and <name> were seated in their tent talking about the meeting with <name> when one of the guards came in and saluted .
" a messenger to see captain <name> and captain pennington , " said the guard .
" show him in , " returned <name> , briefly , thinking it was a simple message about camp duties .
he was rather surprised when a chinaman entered , bowing low as he did so .
" dis <unk> <unk> ? "
asked the newcomer .
" that is my name . "
" dis <unk> <unk> ? "
" yes , " answered <name> .
" sailor man send <name> wow , " went on the chinaman .
" sailor man want see <unk> . "
he pointed to the two young captains .
" sailor man say he <unk> you . "
and now he pointed at <name> alone .
" said he was my brother ? "
cried the young captain .
the messenger nodded .
" name <unk> same <name> <unk> . "
" gracious me ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" <name> , what can this mean ?
i thought <name> sailed away on that warship . "
" so did i .
but she may be back in port . "
" sailor man hurt . "
the chinaman pointed to his side .
" sick  he shot  say you <unk> to-night . "
" sick ?
shot ? "
repeated <name> , and a cold chill went down his backbone .
" that is the worst yet .
where is he ? "
" big walk down by the sea .
<name> wow show .
but must pay  <name> wow poor people . "
" oh , i 'll pay you , " answered <name> , hurriedly .
" <name> , do you think i can get away ? "
" sailor man say <unk> <unk> , " put in the messenger .
" something is wrong , that is certain , " came from <name> .
he eyed the chinaman closely .
" there is no mistake about this ? "
at this <name> wow shrugged his <name> shoulders and looked blank .
" no see <unk> .
see sailor <unk> . "
" i guess he is all right , " put in <name> .
" something has happened to poor <name> .
i wonder if i can get away at once ? "
" let us see the <name> about this . "
<name> hurried off and caught <name> okopa in his own tent .
as the command was not to move until noon of the next day both readily obtained permission to absent themselves until that time .
" but be careful , " said the <name> .
" this may be some chinese trick . "
" we 'll be on our guard , " answered <name> .
the chinese messenger had come in on foot .
he said he was hungry and was given something to eat .
then the three set off , the messenger carrying a knapsack filled with rations , and each of the young captains carrying his sword and his pistol .
they tried to learn from <name> wow how far they would have to travel , but the chinaman either could not or would not inform them .
" perhaps it might have been as well to have taken a detachment of one company along , " suggested <name> .
" i must say , i do n't like the looks of this . "
they were now a good mile away from camp , and in a location that appeared lonely enough .
" well , we are moving down to the seacoast , " returned <name> .
he was taking careful note of the direction they were pursuing .
after that they journeyed along for a good two hours without saying much .
they stepped along briskly , for <name> wanted to learn just what had happened to his brother .
for all he knew to the contrary , <name> might be mortally wounded .
presently they came to a spot in the road where there were a number of dense trees .
<name> wow began to cough loudly .
" what 's the matter ? "
demanded <name> .
for some reason he did not trust the chinaman .
" <unk> fly in float , " was the answer , and <name> wow coughed again .
then he walked on , and they came behind him .
but <name> <name> his pistol and motioned for <name> to do the same .
" i may be mistaken , but we may be walking into a trap , " he whispered .
" why , <name> , i do n't   " began <name> , when without warning a heavy object dropped upon his head from the limb of one of the trees and bore him to the ground .
another object dropped on <name> , but he squirmed from under ,  to find himself confronted by several chunchuses .
a cry went up , and a crashing was heard in the bushes back of the trees .
" a trick , <name> , just as i suspected ! "
ejaculated the young southerner , and he discharged his pistol point-blank at the chinese <unk> in front of him .
this done he made a leap to one side , hurling over <name> wow as he did so , and darted forward into some bushes .
a shot was aimed at him , but did no injury , and he kept on , running as hard as he could .
in the meantime <name> did his best to get up .
but one man was on his shoulders and another had him by the legs , so to move was next to impossible .
then , as he continued to struggle , he received a heavy kick from a wooden shoe which stretched him out like a log .
" he is out of the fight now , " said one of the chunchuses , as he bent over <name> .
" go after the other .
do not let him escape if you can help it .
americans are worth a good deal to us in these days ! "
three of the brigands remained to guard <name> and the others made after <name> .
but they could not catch the young southerner , and after a long <name> they came back .
" he has gone back to his camp , " said one of the chunchuses to his chief .
" he <name> have his friends about our ears very shortly . "
as soon as this news was received , <name> 's hands and feet were bound , and four of the chinamen caught him up as if he were a dead animal and hoisted him on their shoulders .
off they set at a <unk> , with the remaining brigands around them .
it was the <unk> over the rough mountainous road which finally brought the young captain to his senses .
at first he did not realize that he was on the move .
" <name> ! "
he called faintly .
" <name> ! "
nobody answered him , and now he essayed to sit up .
he could not budge and consequently began to struggle .
" be still ! "
cried one of the chunchuses , in chinese .
" where am i ?
what are you doing to me ? "
queried <name> .
for answer he received a good shaking and was then dumped on the ground .
his feet were liberated , and the chief of the chinese brigands ordered him to move along , pointing the end of his sword at the prisoner as he did so .
" where is my friend ? "
asked <name> .
" he is dead , " said the chief , laconically .
" dead ! "
burst out the young captain .
his heart seemed to become like a lump of lead .
<name> , his own true chum , dead !
it was too horrible to believe .
" yes , and you <name> be unless you walk on , " added the chief of the chunchuses .
there was no help for it , and , bruised and bleeding , the young captain took up the march , with his enemies on all sides of him .
the gait was a rapid one , and before they came to a halt once more he was all but exhausted .
" where are you taking me ? "
he asked .
" wait and see . "
the chief of the chunchuses grinned wickedly .
" i shall have to trouble you for your valuables , " he went on , in his native tongue , and without further ado stripped <name> of his possessions , including his watch , money , ring , and sword .
there was no use protesting , and therefore the young captain did not attempt it .
he was marched along a marshy path , and presently came in sight of the ocean and a small bay , where two sailing ships and a small steamer lay at anchor .
a shrill whistle sounded out , and this was answered by somebody on the steamer .
then a small boat put in to shore , carrying four sailors and an officer .
as soon as the officer landed , he was called aside by the chief of the chunchuses , and a conference lasting several minutes followed .
" it shall be as you say , <name> fee , " said the officer , in russian .
" it is too bad you did not get the other , too .
i know <name> snokoff , and captain barusky too , and there <name> be money in this .
yes , i 'll take him on board at once .
you had better watch out that the soldiers do not get after you . "
" trust <name> fee to take care of himself , " said the chief of the chunchuses .
with scant ceremony <name> was conducted to the small boat and told to get in .
he asked where they were going to take him , but could get no satisfaction .
as soon as the steamer was reached , he was conducted to an empty stateroom and locked in .
" this is the worst yet ! "
he muttered , as he sat down .
" i suppose they intend to <name> me miles and miles away .
poor <name> !
i never thought he would be killed in such a fashion as this !
what <unk> these chinese brigands are !
it 's a wonder they did n't kill me too !
can that story about <name> be true ? "
there was a little water in the stateroom , and as his hands had been released , <name> bathed his wounds and bound them up as best he could .
he heard the steamer move away from the shore , and soon the steady pounding of the engines proved that she was forging ahead at her best rate of speed .
he was a prisoner of the enemy , and what they were going to do with him was a question still to be answered .
chapter xxiv the defense of the powder train after firing on the chinese brigands as already described , <name> plunged into the brushwood which was not over half a dozen yards distant .
he heard the shots discharged at him in return , but fortunately every one went wide of its <name> .
once in the brushwood he did not stop , but continued on his way for several rods .
then he paused , wondering if <name> was anywhere in the vicinity .
" i <name> they did n't kill him , " he murmured .
" what a trap that was , and how easily we walked into it ! "
he waited and listened , but nobody came near him .
then , with caution , he pushed ahead , until he gained once more the road leading back to the temporary camp occupied by the powder train and the detachment guarding it .
following this , he ran on at full speed until the welcome camp-fires greeted him .
" <name> okopa , we have been attacked by chunchuses ! "
he exclaimed , as he rushed up to the officer 's quarters .
and in a brief manner he explained the situation so far as he knew it .
the japanese <name> had taken a strong liking to <name> and <name> , and he lost no time in ordering out a company to round up the chinese brigands if they could be located .
it was <name> 's own command and he was given permission to remain out the whole night and the next day if necessary .
the young southerner went at the task with vigor , for he realized that every moment was precious .
he explained the situation to his men , and they set off at double-quick to where the attack had been made .
as was to be expected , the spot was deserted .
by torchlight they saw the evidences of the struggle which had taken place .
in one spot was a pool of blood , left by the <unk> whom <name> had shot in the shoulder .
" they went off in this direction , " said one of the soldiers , who was good at tracing footsteps .
he pointed to a side road , and along this they ran , keeping eyes and ears on the alert , so as to avoid anything in the nature of a surprise .
two hours later the company found itself on the seashore .
but chunchuses and vessels were gone and to where it was impossible to find out .
but on the beach <name> picked up an empty pocketbook which he knew was <unk> property .
" they brought him here most likely , " he said .
" see , here are the marks of a rowboat , and of many feet .
they have gone off on the water . "
" then the hunt is at a standstill , " returned his second in command .
the young captain was unwilling to believe this , and the remainder of the night , and the next forenoon , were spent in an eager search after the enemy .
but it was useless ; and at last <name> , sick at heart , ordered his men to return to the camp .
on the following day the powder train moved onward once more .
the first lieutenant of <name> 's company took command of the body , and <name> was marked " missing " on the roll .
" it is certainly too bad , and i sympathize with you , captain pennington , " said <name> okopa .
" captain <name> is a fine fellow . "
" it takes all the vigor out of me , " replied <name> .
" <name> and i were like two brothers . "
but <name> was given no time in which to grieve over <unk> disappearance .
two days later , the powder train was attacked by a detachment of the russians , who seemed to spring out of the very ground .
one of the wagons loaded with powder was blown to atoms , killing two horses and three soldiers .
" <unk> !  " cried the japanese , and when the order was given they attacked the enemy with vigor .
it was a hot fight , lasting half an hour , and the russians were driven among some high hills , backed up by several mountains .
as the powder train had to go through one of the mountain passes so close at hand , the soldiers were sent ahead , to clear the way of all russians that might appear .
this was dangerous work , for the enemy had the advantage of the higher position .
but the japanese were undaunted , and rushed up one slope after another with a vigor and animation that was surprising .
" ca n't hold them back , when once they get started , " said <name> , to the <name> .
" they are like our southern bloodhounds , when once they strike the scent . "
" and that is the way to win victory , " answered <name> okopa .
not long after this <name> found himself at the foot of a steep hill with his company .
at the top of the hill were a number of great <unk> and behind these some of the russians were in hiding , sending down a spiteful fire whenever the opportunity presented itself .
" we must dislodge those fellows , " said <name> okopa .
" it is very dangerous work .
do you think you can accomplish it , captain pennington ? "
" i can try , " answered <name> , modestly , and ordered his company forward .
he turned them slightly to the left , for here a fringe of thin brushwood offered a shelter that was not great , but much better than none .
" <name> okopa expects us to take this hill , " he said , in the best japanese he could muster .
" let us do our best ! "
" <unk> !  " came the rallying cry from the men , and up the slope they rushed , with <name> at their side .
crack !
crack !
went the rifles of the russians , and then , without warning , several shells were sent up .
one man of <name> 's company was killed and two wounded , but they did not waver .
passing the brushwood , they ran out boldly on the slope above them .
many of the rocks at the top of the hill were loose , and as the japanese came closer , the enemy began to send them down in a shower which was highly dangerous to those below .
" beware of the stones ! "
cried <name> .
he had hardly spoken when he saw that he would have to look after his own safety .
the russians were working over a rock that weighed several hundreds of pounds .
all at once the mass broke loose .
there was a yell of delight from above , and then the big <unk> came rolling straight for <name> .
had it touched him he must surely have been crushed to death .
but the young southerner was as cool as he was quick .
pausing to make certain which way the big stone was coming down , he made a quick leap in the opposite direction .
then the <unk> went bounding past him , to crash into some small trees at the bottom of the hill .
" are you hurt , captain ? "
asked his lieutenant .
" no , " answered <name> .
then he leaped to the front once more .
" come ! "
he cried .
" <unk> !  forward for the mikado ! "
and on the whole company went as before , firing rapidly as they did so .
the russians clung to the hilltop a few minutes longer , and then , as the first of the japanese gained a footing there , they broke and fled in wild disorder down the other side of the hill , and into the woods to the northward .
the japanese pursued them for two hours but could not catch them , and at last the <name> was abandoned .
in this skirmish , called the battle of <unk> , the japanese lost in killed and wounded four men , and the russians seven .
three of the czar 's soldiers were also taken prisoners .
after that the powder train had no more difficulty , and four days later reached its destination , which was the village of <unk> , where the japanese had established something of a base of supplies for that portion of the army which was moving southward to join in the siege of port <name> .
at <unk> , <name> okopa 's command received orders to go into camp instead of returning to the vicinity of <unk> .
" this looks to me as if we were to be transferred to the army in the south , " said the <name> , after communicating the news to <name> .
" well , i should n't mind helping to take port <name> , " returned the young southerner .
" if you <name> remember , it was my treatment by the russians at that place which caused me to take up arms against them . "
" so you said before , captain pennington .
but do not imagine that the taking of port <name> <name> be easy .
the russians have fortified it in every possible manner . "
" yes ,  they were doing that before i came away from there . "
" for months they have been strengthening their fortifications , and getting in ammunition and supplies in secret .
their chain of forts extend , so i have been told , for twenty miles and more outside of the city , and being in a mountainous country , they <name> be hard to reduce . "
" do n't you think we can capture the place ? "
demanded <name> .
" capture it ?
most assuredly , captain .
but it <name> mean a great destruction of life , " returned <name> okopa , gravely .
what the <name> said about the russians <unk> port <name> was true .
lieutenant-general <unk> , the russian commander at that place , had under him sixty thousand men , the very flower of the russian army .
on the side of the sea the town was fortified at a dozen points , only three of which had been thus far captured under the japanese army led by general <unk> .
to the northward and the westward were some twenty defenses , set among the mountains where they were next to impossible to reach .
in a work of this kind , it is impossible to relate in detail all of the many battles fought over the possession of port <name> .
the first assault was made in february by admiral togo 's fleet , and the naval conflict was kept up for almost three months after that .
in the meantime a japanese army under general <unk> landed at <unk> , and after several battles at <unk> and <unk> hill , drove the russians back to their mountain defenses and took possession of the railroad running to <unk> and <unk> .
thus port <name> was cut off from almost all communication with the outside world .
chapter xxv <unk> a port <name> fort <name> felt very happy after having met <name> and <name> .
he had been afraid he should find that his brother or his friend was wounded , even though no mention of such an occurrence had been made in the letter he had received .
he knew from experience that <name> was in the habit of making light of things that went wrong .
" i suppose it did your heart good to meet 'em both , " said <name> , after the warship was on the way .
" you 're right , <name> ; it was a regular touch of old times . "
" wish i had seen 'em myself . "
" both wanted to be remembered to you . "
<name> paused for a moment .
" by the way , i wonder where we are bound now ? "
" ca n't say as to that , lad  secret orders , i reckon , " answered the old tar .
the order to sail was evidently an important one , for scarcely was the shohirika out of sight of land than all steam was crowded on .
the <unk> were also doubled , and when night came the strictest watch possible was maintained .
yet , with it all , several days passed without anything out of the ordinary happening .
drills and exercises went on as before , and both <name> and <name> made themselves familiar with all parts of the warship .
both spent much time in <unk> themselves with such orders as were given to them in japanese , so that they might not be too " green , " as <name> termed it , if put to the test .
during those days spent on shipboard matters concerning the great war were moving forward steadily .
in the vicinity of <unk> both the japanese and the russians made several movements to better their positions .
this brought on a few skirmishes and one heavy battle , in which the losses were several hundreds on each side .
there was also an advance on the outer forts of port <name> , and a fair-sized hill was captured by the mikado 's men , who , however held the place only at an enormous loss of life .
in moving on the port the japanese found they would have to do a great amount of <unk> and <unk> , all of which consumed time .
on the ocean the two nations were equally active .
both took several prizes of war , and in an encounter with the <unk> squadron a russian warship was hopelessly disabled and a japanese cruiser was all but sunk .
another ship belonging to admiral togo 's fleet struck a mine outside of port <name> and had to be sent back to japan for repairs .
so far the weather had been warm , but autumn was now at hand and before long the nights became cold and raw .
" this war wo n't be finished this <name> , " said more than one .
" we are in for another year of it , sure . "
the shohirika had been summoned to join the fleet <unk> before port <name> .
two days before that station was reached they fell in with a sister ship which brought the news of an encounter with a russian battleship carrying some troops from siberia .
both warships had suffered and become separated in the darkness .
" this war is certainly warming up , " said <name> .
" i <name> we see some fighting before it is over . "
" maybe we 'll see more of it than you wish , " said <name> , grimly .
" do n't you worry  we 'll see a whole lot , " put in <name> <name> , who was sitting on a ditty chest , playing <unk> with <name> <name> .
" just wait till we get under admiral togo 's eye  he 'll make us be up and doing . "
the chance to see some of the war came the next day , when they were ordered to bombard one of the forts to the north of port <name> proper .
as soon as they came within four miles of the fort they received a reception which was as warm as it was exciting .
" now , here is where we show what we can do ! "
cried <name> , as the orders came to begin firing , and the whole gun company jumped in to assist him .
the magazines were opened up , the <unk> set to work , and soon the first real shell  not a mere blank for practicing  came up and was run into the gun .
then the <unk> was swung to and locked , the electric connection set , and <name> sighted the piece with care , after having first received the proper distance from the <unk> in the tops .
as soon as the " sight " was " covered " the button was pressed , and bang !  went the gun with a concussion that shook the whole ship .
other guns followed in rapid succession , until <name> had to stuff cotton in his ears to keep himself from becoming deaf .
as soon as the gun was discharged , it was opened to let the gases out and then cleaned with wet <unk> and flushed with running water to cool the barrel .
the bombardment lasted for an hour , and during that time the fort was hit in a dozen places .
sand , dirt , and rocks flew in all directions , and once there came a flash which told of an explosion of a quantity of powder .
" if we could only hit the magazine it would be good-by to that fort , " said <name> , but this was not to be .
after the first few shots the fort had remained silent , but now , when the shohirika was about to retire , the gunners opened up once more , and a rain of shot and shell flew all around the warship .
one struck the bow of the vessel , tearing off a few feet of the forward deck and another entered the forward turret , killing one of the <unk> assistants .
" we can be thankful we were n't in that turret , " said <name> , when he received the latter news .
" yes , indeed ! "
murmured <name> , and could not repress a shiver .
" i can tell you , it 's mighty risky work after all ! "
he added , soberly .
" well , we 've got one advantage over those fellows , " put in <name> , after the firing had come to an end , and the warship was fast getting out of range .
" we can run away , while they have got to stay right where they are . "
" oh , they can run away too , " said <name> .
" not unless they abandon their fort ,  and that would be just as if we should abandon our ship . "
the work at the gun had been severe , and after the bombardment was over <name> was glad to clean up and take a rest .
the perspiration , <unk> , and smoke had made him look like a negro , and he used up several buckets of water before he got himself into as cleanly a condition as was habitual with him .
<name> also took a " <unk> down , " as he called it , and so did the others .
what amazed <name> more than anything was the quietness of the japanese sailors .
now that the bombardment was ended they said scarcely a word about it , but went on exactly as before .
" they are the most matter-of-fact chaps i ever saw ! "
he declared .
" i believe if the ship blew up they would say 'very sorry ' and swim away .
now on one of uncle <name> 's ships the men would be all woke up and out for a <unk> .
<name> says it 's the same way in the army .
if they get excited at all they always seem to be sorry for it afterwards ! "
" that 's what ye call a characteristic o ' the race , i reckon , " returned <name> .
" they 're taught to act that way from <unk> .
it ai n't polite nor high-toned to git excited .
the only thing they kin yell is <unk> !  an' they let thet out loud enough , goodness knows ! "
" i ca n't understand why we did n't keep at that fort , " came from <name> .
" i was just getting the range beautifully when orders came to shut down . "
" well , there must be a reason for it , <name> , " answered <name> .
there was a reason for it .
admiral togo had just received word that certain ships of the port <name> squadron were going to make an attempt to break out of the harbor , either that night or the next day .
consequently the shohirika was needed further down the coast , and steamed away in that direction as rapidly as her somewhat limited supply of coal permitted .
" i do n't think the navy <name> ever find its way into port <name> harbor , " said <name> , later on , after studying a map of that locality .
" there are too many forts on the hills outside of the town .
they could smash our ships to <unk> if we got too close . "
" trust admiral togo to know what he is doing , " answered <name> <name> .
" he wo n't go too close .
at the same time he ai n't going to let the russian ships get away any more than schley and sampson let admiral cervera get away from <name> harbor in cuba . "
" it 's the army that <name> make port <name> a hot place to live in , " came from <name> <name> .
" they can <unk> and thus gain a little ground day by day , and as soon as they win some high point , like say <unk> hill , it <name> be all up with general <unk> , <name> my words . "
the night to follow proved to be <name> , and so cold that the majority of the sailors were glad to <name> their heavy <unk> .
fearing that the enemy would try to take advantage of the weather , admiral togo turned on all the <unk> his fleet possessed , and these were flashed in all directions .
" false alarm , " said <name> , after midnight had sounded out on the ship's <name> .
" reckon the russians do n't dare to come out . "
but the old yankee tar was mistaken .
the enemy were on the alert , and at three o'clock , when the mist was extra heavy , the movement to steal out of port <name> harbor was begun , two torpedo destroyers taking the lead , and several cruisers following .
this brought on a heavy <unk> lasting far into the next day , and one which came close to cost <name> his life .
chapter xxvi <name> meets captain barusky for several days poor <name> remained a prisoner aboard of the small steamer .
during that time only two men came near him  an under officer and the sailor who supplied him with food and water .
neither would answer his questions , so he could not learn where he was being taken or what was to be done with him .
one evening there was a slight commotion on the deck , and the course of the steamer was changed .
then came a blowing of steam whistles lasting several minutes .
finally the steamer came to a standstill .
" you are to leave this vessel at once , " said the under officer , as he opened the door of the young captain 's temporary prison .
" come , we have no time to spare . "
" where am i to go ? "
questioned <name> .
" you <name> soon learn .
hurry ! "
there was no help for it , and soon <name> was on deck .
he was made to enter a small boat and was thus transferred to another steamer  one which had formerly been in the east indian trade but which was now acting as a russian supply boat .
" what a dirty craft ! "
was his mental comment , after having been thrust into a pen which was little better than a horse stall .
the supply boat was loaded to its fullest capacity , so quarters for all on board were limited .
two days passed and he received food which was scarcely fit to eat .
when he protested he was threatened with a flogging .
the air was foul and he began to fear that he would become sick .
" i wo n't be able to stand this much longer , " he thought , dismally .
" if they want to kill me why do n't they do it at once and have done with it ? "
on the following morning a surprise awaited him .
he heard two russian officers pause in front of his pen and one said to the other : " here is the prisoner , captain barusky . "
" is it the fellow named <name> ? "
was the question from captain barusky , the rascal who had aided <name> snokoff to make so much trouble for <name> pennington .
" the same . "
" they did not capture his friend ? "
" no  in the struggle he slipped away . "
" i am sorry for that .
we wanted pennington more than we did this fellow .
but i am glad we got at least one of them .
as i understand it they work <unk> with each other ; " and then the two russian officers passed on .
like a flash <name> realized the truth of the situation .
his taking off had been a trap set by snokoff and this captain barusky , who had hired the chunchuses to help work out their plot .
he was now in the hands of the enemy in more ways than one .
" they wo n't treat me as an ordinary prisoner , " he reasoned .
" this captain barusky <name> make it as hard as possible for me  more especially so as <name> managed to escape his clutches .
well , i am glad <name> got away . "
resolved to " take the bull by the horns , " <name> asked the prison guard if he might speak to captain barusky .
" i <name> see about it , " answered the sailor , and went off to find out .
on his return he stated that the captain would visit the pen some time during the day .
the russian officer came late in the afternoon , when nobody else was near the pen .
there was a sarcastic look on his face when he gazed at the young captain .
" so you want to talk to me , " he said , abruptly .
" i do , captain barusky .
i want to know why this plot was laid against me . "
" i know of no plot .
you are an american in the employ of the japanese government as a spy .
russia captures all the japanese spies she can . "
" i am no spy . "
the russian shrugged his shoulders .
" that is what your friend , captain pennington , once told me , too .
yet as soon as he got out of port <name> he was made a captain in the mikado 's army . "
" he applied for the position because the russians had <unk> him and because he loves active service . "
" have it as you please , <name> ; both of you are spies , and you <name> have to suffer as one . "
" where are you taking me ? "
" since you seem so anxious to know , i <name> tell you , for i do not think you <name> be able to take the news to the japanese .
this boat is carrying supplies to port <name> . "
" port <name> ! "
" that is what i said .
when we arrive there you <name> be placed in one of the strongest of our prisons at the port .
do you not admire the prospect ? "
" well , if you take me to port <name> , perhaps i <name> n't be a prisoner long , " replied <name> , resolved to put on as bold a front as possible .
" and why not ? "
demanded captain barusky , curiously .
" because our army and our navy are bound to capture the place . "
" bah !
the japanese <name> never take port <name> .
it is absurd to think of it . "
" it may not come right away  but it <name> come sooner or later . "
" never !
but if it should , you <name> not be there to enjoy our downfall .
remember that spies are tried , and if found guilty they are taken out and shot . "
" you can not prove that i am a spy . "
" that remains to be seen . "
" if you bring me before the court i 'll have something to say about your underhanded work with <name> snokoff .
i can prove that he is a swindler and that you are his accomplice . "
" <name> !
you threaten me ! "
roared captain barusky , in a rage .
" have a care !
i come from a most respectable family and i have great influence . "
" nevertheless , i think those who are higher in authority than yourself <name> listen to my story .
the russian army officers are as a rule gentlemen and strictly honest . "
" which means to say that i am not a gentleman and not honest ! "
bellowed captain barusky .
" that , for your opinion ! "
and reaching out he gave <name> a ringing box on the ear .
it was the last straw .
with no fresh air and no food fit to eat , the young captain was desperate , and leaping forward he struck at the russian captain 's nose .
his fist went true , and as barusky staggered back against the pen door the blood <unk> from his nasal organ .
" do n't you dare to hit me again ! "
panted <name> , standing before the russian with both hands clenched .
" do n't you dare  or you 'll get the worst of it ! "
his manner made captain barusky <unk> back , and he glared at <name> with the ferocity of a wild beast .
then he called to the guard .
" run for aid , <unk> , " he said .
" the prisoner has attacked me .
he is a beast , and must be chained up . "
the man addressed summoned three other sailors and the captain of the ship 's guard .
all came into the pen and forced <name> into a corner .
" the yankee dog ! "
said the captain of the guard .
" to dare to strike a russian officer !
bring the chains at once ! "
chains were brought , and soon <name> was bound hands and feet , with links that weighed several pounds .
then a large staple was driven into one of the <unk> of the pen and he was fastened to this with a <unk> .
" now place him on <unk> , " said captain barusky .
" it is the only way to tame him . "
and then he hurried away to bathe his nose , which was swelling rapidly .
if <name> had been miserable before he was doubly so now .
the chains were <unk> and cut into his flesh , and being fastened to the upright he could scarcely move a foot either way .
to add to his misery the front of the pen was boarded over , so that what little light had been admitted to his prison was cut off .
in this wretched condition he passed a full week .
in that time captain barusky came to peep in at him three times , and on each occasion tried to say something to make him still more <unk> .
the food was so bad he could not eat and the air often made his head ache as if it would crack open .
" if this is a sample of russian prison life it 's a wonder all the prisoners do n't go mad , " he reasoned .
" a few months of this would surely kill me . "
at the end of the week <name> heard firing at a distance .
the supply boat was now trying to steal into port <name> and had been discovered by a japanese patrol boat .
the craft was struck twice and the prisoner below heard a wild commotion on the deck , as one of the funnels was carried away .
but darkness favored the russians , and inside of two hours the supply boat passed into port <name> harbor without sustaining further damage .
she was then directed to a proper anchorage by the harbor master ; and on the following day the transfer of her cargo to the <unk> on shore was begun .
for several days longer <name> was kept on the boat .
then , one wet and cold morning , he was liberated and told to march on deck .
from the vessel he was taken to a big stone building which was being used as one of the garrison quarters .
here he was given a scant hearing in the presence of captain barusky , who appeared against him .
" we have no time to investigate your case at present , captain <name> , " said the officer who conducted the examination .
" but from reports i should surmise that you are a dangerous young man .
you must remain a prisoner . "
and then the young captain was taken away .
later on , he was marched a distance of half a mile and blindfolded .
when the bandage was removed from his eyes , he found himself in an old stone building , dirty and neglected .
he was taken to a small room , having a grated window , and thrust inside .
six other prisoners were put into the apartment with him , one man with a hacking cough , dreadful to hear .
the door was closed and barred ; and all were left to take care of themselves as best they could .
chapter xxvii a fierce battle at sea <name> was taking a nap when the call came to clear the ship for action .
it had been discovered that the russian fleet was trying to escape from port <name> harbor , and the news was flashed from vessel to vessel of admiral togo 's fleet , and all were ordered to prevent the movement at any cost .
" now i reckon we are in fer it ! "
ejaculated <name> , as he and the youth rushed over to their gun .
" <name> , it 's in my mind we have some tall work cut out fer us this trip ! "
" let it come  i am in just the humor for fighting ! "
cried <name> .
" i <name> we can smash them just as we smashed the spanish ships in manila bay . "
sailors and gunners were hurrying in all directions , and orders were coming in rapid succession .
at first the russian ships had turned in one direction , now they were turning in another , and , later still , they separated .
a distant firing could already be heard , but where it came from those on the shohirika could not tell .
so far no ships of the enemy could be seen with the naked eye .
the <unk> kept a close watch , and the <unk> continued to play all over the bosom of the rolling sea .
it was almost daylight when a distant explosion was heard .
a russian torpedo boat had run into a mine and was so badly damaged that she sank inside of ten minutes , carrying a large part of her crew with her .
this disaster proved a warning to the other russian ships and they proceeded on their courses with added caution .
the japanese warships were equally on the alert , yet , just as the sun came up , one brushed against a mine and received such damage that she was practically put out of the contest .
" there is one of the enemy 's ships ! "
was the cry , as the mist swept away as if by magic and the sun came out strongly .
" now is our chance .
<unk> !  " " and there is another ship ! "
came a moment later , " and one of our own pounding her as if she was a witch ! "
guns were now booming over the water constantly , and from the forts on shore came shots and shells in rapid succession .
soon the shohirika was in the midst of the battle , and then <name> and <name> worked over the gun as never before , doing their full share towards <unk> the ship that was trying to escape up the <unk> coast .
for over an hour the running fire kept up .
neither ship dared to put on full speed , for fear of running into a mine .
solid shot was hurled in all directions , and the shohirika received one below the water line which for the moment looked as if it might sink the craft .
but the ship 's carpenter and his crew got at the leak immediately , driving in a wedge which quickly stopped the flow of water .
it was hard , exhausting work between decks , and at the end of an hour <name> felt he must have some fresh air .
both he and <name> applied for permission to go on deck , and this permission was readily granted , for the guns on their side of the warship were not then in use .
on the deck of the shohirika they could see what this battle really meant .
dirt and debris were to be seen in many places , and half a dozen sailors and marines had been killed or wounded .
everybody was bathed in perspiration and <unk> , and some of those who worked the big guns were panting like dogs after a <name> .
" it 's work , that 's what it is , " said <name> , running the perspiration from his <unk> forehead with his finger .
" ai n't no child 's play about it ! "
" and dangerous work at that , " added <name> .
he gave a look toward the enemy 's ships .
" i declare , <name> , i believe they are running back to port <name> harbor ! "
" i think the same , lad , " responded the yankee gunner .
" reckon they are <unk> ' it is goin ' to cost too much to get away .
as soon as they get away from them land batteries we can pound 'em for keeps and they know it . "
" and get away from the mines .
that 's the worst with fighting around here  you do n't know how soon you 'll hit a mine and be blown up . "
" oh , i reckon our captain is watching out fer them pesky things . "
<name> was interested in watching the sharpshooters and <unk> in the tops , and he walked across the deck to get a better look at them .
<name> followed , and as he did so , one of the nearest of the russian ships sent out a roaring broadside at the shohirika which raked her fore and aft and sent another hole through her side , but this time above the water line where it did scant damage .
" gee <name> ! "
began <name> , when he chanced to glance upward .
" <name> , look out ! "
he screamed .
" the top 's coming down on ye ! "
<name> was right .
one of the shots from the enemy had struck the foremast , above the fighting top , and it was crashing down , carrying a portion of the ship 's flag with it .
one end struck the gun turret , and then the wreckage hit <name> on the shoulder , hurling him on his back .
the foremast was heavy and had it struck the youth before landing on the turret and the surrounding works it might have killed the young <unk> mate on the spot .
as it was , <name> lay like a log where he had fallen and when <name> raised him up the old tar found him unconscious .
" if he ai n't got his shoulder broke then i miss my guess , " muttered the yankee gunner .
" <name> !
<name> !
ca n't ye speak to me ? "
" that was a nasty one , " came from one of the officers of the deck .
" better <name> him below . "
and then the officer gave orders to remove the wreckage and hoist the flag once more .
with the unconscious youth in his arms , <name> hurried below and to the sick bay of the warship .
here the surgeon got to work immediately and examined <name> thoroughly .
" no bones broken , " he announced .
" but the bruise is severe and he is suffering from shock .
he <name> soon come to his senses . "
<name> had to return to his gun , for duty is duty in the navy , regardless of what is happening around one .
it was true , the russian warships were now doing their best to sneak back into port <name> harbor and admiral togo wanted to do all the damage possible before the forts made it impossible to follow them further .
all of the warships ' guns were worked to their utmost , and when the russian vessels did get back they were so badly crippled that they were of small consequence for future fighting until undergoing repairs .
when <name> opened his eyes again he found himself lying on a clean white cot in the ship 's hospital with an attendant standing over him bathing his face .
" oh ! "
he murmured and stared around him .
" oh , my shoulder !
that was a fearful crack i got ! "
the attendant did not understand , but smiled blandly and continued to bathe his face and also his head .
soon the full realization of what had happened came to the young gunner 's mate .
then he asked about <name> .
the fighting was at an end and presently <name> came to him , to find <name> sitting up in a chair .
" i feel stiff and sore all over , <name> , " said the youth .
" it was just as if a house came down on me . "
" thank fortune you was n't killed , or did n't have your bones broken , " returned the yankee gunner .
" i am thankful .
were you hurt ? "
" not in the least . "
" what about the fight ? "
" the russians have sneaked back into the harbor like a lot of whipped dogs . "
" what is our ship doing ? "
" putting up the coast .
i do n't know where we are going , " answered <name> .
<name> remained in the ship 's hospital for three days and then resumed his duties as before .
his shoulder still felt stiff and sore and lifting anything was a good deal of labor .
but <name> favored him , so he got along very well .
a week passed and the shohirika remained at sea , moving in a wide circle , on the lookout for russian warships or supply boats .
but none were encountered , and then the cruiser was ordered to escort a transport filled with soldiers bound for the front .
the transport landed at a point some miles north of <unk> and the troops went ashore without delay .
they were bound for the railroad , and were to participate in the advance upon port <name> from that point .
as the warship remained in the harbor several days , both <name> and <name> were allowed a short run on shore .
they enjoyed this trip very much , until , much to their surprise , they learned that <name> okopa 's command was in the vicinity .
then they hunted this up , to learn the sad news from <name> that <name> was missing .
" missing ! "
ejaculated <name> , in horror .
" taken by chunchuses !
oh , <name> , this is dreadful ! "
" well , i do n't know as you feel any worse than i do , <name> , " answered <name> .
" it makes me wild to think of it . "
" but could n't you find any trace of him at all ? "
" not the slightest , although i think he was carried off in a boat . "
" but why should the chinese brigands make him a prisoner ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know , excepting to hold him for a ransom .
but if they intended to do that it is likely we should have heard from them before this . "
the matter was discussed as long as <name> and <name> could remain on shore .
but nothing came of it , and with a heavy heart the young <unk> mate returned to his place on the warship .
chapter xxviii the siege of port <name> after the fruitless effort to escape from port <name> harbor the russian warships " bottled up " there remained where they were for a long time to come .
occasionally one or another attempted to run the blockade , but results were usually disastrous , and at last the risk became so great nothing more was done in that direction .
the japanese continued to put down mines and sank several boats loaded with stone in or near the winding channel , and this made getting in as hard as getting out  thus putting a stop to the arrival of more supply boats , such as brought <name> to the seaport .
in the meantime the campaign on land was pushed forward with increased activity .
the headquarters of the japanese army investing port <name> was not far from the railroad , but the lines stretched many miles to the east and the west .
troops were hurried both from japan and from the divisions near <unk> , and heavy siege guns were mounted on every available hilltop .
the japanese were , at the start , at a great disadvantage  they could not see the enemy at which they were firing .
hills and mountains cut them off from every view of the port .
but they kept hammering away , day after day , week after week , and month after month , gaining steadily , throwing up new intrenchments , digging new tunnels , and hauling their heavy guns forward to more advantageous positions .
the labor was body racking and the sacrifice of life enormous .
but the mikado 's soldiers did not appear to care .
they had set out to capture port <name> and they were going to do it .
for the <unk> and for the cavalry there was at the start but little to do in the way of fighting .
most of the time was spent in digging trenches and tunnels , and in keeping out of the way of shells that whistled and screamed in all directions  shells weighing hundreds of pounds , which , when they struck , tore up the ground for yards around and smashed the rocks as if the latter were passing through a quartz <unk> .
such is war of modern times , when carried on at a distance of miles .
but as the months went by , and japanese and russians came closer to each other , hand-to-hand conflicts became numerous .
the russians <unk> every foot of the ground , fighting with a courage that was truly heroic , and sacrificing themselves freely for the czar and the country they loved .
the hand-to-hand conflicts became bloody in the extreme , thousands upon thousands being slaughtered between the rising and the setting of the sun .
from the seacoast the command to which <name> was attached moved to a small place called <unk> <unk> .
here they went into camp for several weeks and while there were joined by a number of other commands , including that containing those old soldiers of fortune , <name> <name> and <name> stummer , who had served with <name> and <name> in cuba and in the philippines .
" py <unk> , of it to n't done mine heart goot to see you , <unk> ! "
exclaimed <name> stummer , rushing up and giving <name> a handshake .
" how you peen , <unk> ? "
" first rate , stummer .
and how are you , <name> ? "
" sure an ' it 's meself is as <unk> as a fiddle , " answered the irishman , with a broad grin on his freckled face .
" it 's a great war , ai n't it now ?
both <unk> is fightin ' like a pair o ' <unk> cats , so they are !
an' where is me ould friend , captain <name> ? "
" he was captured by chunchuses . "
" no ! "
came from both stummer and <name> , and then they poured in a volley of questions which were bewildering .
<name> answered them as best he could .
" <name> 's der <unk> ding vot i hear yet alretty ! "
said <name> stummer , with a sad shake of his head .
" i <unk> i got dem <unk>  or vot you call dem  here .
i fix 'em , eh , tan ? "
<name> <name> nodded vigorously .
" sure an ' we 'd be after puttin ' a ball through <unk> mother 's son of 'em , so we would !
poor <name> <name> !
i <unk> him <unk> a brother ! "
and the honest <name> <unk> heaved a long sigh .
both <name> and stummer had been having easy times of it for several weeks , but now they were called upon to go forth with pick and shovel , to do their share of work in digging intrenchments .
this was not so nice , but they went at the labor without a murmur .
" sure an ' we might as well git into practice , " observed <name> , as he started in with vigor .
" whin the war 's over an ' we git back to the states , it may be ourselves as <name> be workin ' fer the corporation in new york or <unk> ! "
" yah , udder puttin ' town railroad <unk> alretty in der vest , " answered <name> stummer .
" <name> is , " he added , " of i to n't got money enough to <unk> a farm . "
" 't is a stock farm i 'm <unk> ' , " came from <name> .
" wid horses <unk> .
there 's money for ye , <name> ! "
and he went to work with added vigor  as if he expected to turn up the stock farm from the soil beneath him .
to <name> , even though he occasionally saw stummer and <name> , the days were very lonely .
he missed <name> greatly , and each day wondered if he would ever see his old war chum again .
<name> okopa saw this and did what he could to cheer up the young officer .
" he may turn up before you realize it , " said the <name> .
" i do n't think he was killed . "
" if he is alive , it is very strange that we do not hear from him . "
two days later came a batch of letters into camp , written , or rather painted , for the most part , on thin japanese paper .
among the communications were two for <name> , one from captain ponsberry concerning the columbia and her cargo , and the other from a stranger in pekin , <name> .
" who can be writing to me from pekin , <name> ? "
mused the young captain , and began to read the communication with interest .
it was from a chinese merchant , and ran in part as follows : " you <name> be mystified to receive this from an utter stranger , but i deem it my duty , kind sir , to send this word to you .
" know , then , that one <name> gow , a servant of my family , was in port <name> up to sixteen days ago  first a servant in an american family there , and next a prisoner in the <unk> prison man ever saw , guarded by dogs of russians unworthy to be used as door mats .
<name> gow is a faithful man , the flower of all my help .
" it is needless to explain to you why my servant was thus <unk> .
but you must know that when in prison he met your great friend captain <name> <name> , and it was the captain who saved <name> gow from many hard blows from the other prisoners , who wanted not a chinaman amongst them .
" <name> gow was grateful , even as i am grateful , and he promised to get word to you of this matter if the russians granted him his <name> .
finding no fault in my servant he was , after a time , liberated , and watching his chance , left port <name> and came home .
" kind sir , he is grateful to captain <name> and would do much for him if he could .
yet his most is to send this letter to you , telling you that captain <name> is alive and held in a port <name> prison as a spy .
one russian hates him  his name , captain barusky ,  and it would appear that this russian is also your enemy , so beware of him .
" i can tell no more .
<name> gow is sick from his treatment at the hands of the russian dogs .
accept this miserable assurance of my eternal friendship , and esteem for one i know must be high and illustrious . "
" <unk> mo . "
<name> read the letter several times and showed it to <name> okopa .
it was written in true chinese style , with a big chinese seal attached , and was , beyond all doubt , genuine .
" i ca n't understand one thing , " said the young captain .
" how did <name> get to port <name> ? "
" it may be that this captain barusky had him taken there , captain pennington . "
" i thought captain barusky was at <unk> . "
" the russians have been taking in some troops at port <name> on the sly .
despite admiral togo 's efforts , some supply boats and transports have passed his ships . "
" if barusky is there he <name> do what he can to make <name> miserable .
he is down on both of us  for he knows we are down on him and <name> snokoff . "
" do you think snokoff could have anything to do with this ? "
" i 'm sure i do n't know .
anything is possible .
snokoff would be glad to make trouble for <name>  since he helped me to make him settle up at <unk> .
those chunchuses tried to capture both of us . "
the matter was talked over for half an hour , but brought forth no satisfaction .
to <name> 's mind , being held by the russians as a spy was as bad as being in the hands of the chinese brigands .
" i wish we could get into port <name> at once , " he said , finally .
" i should n't like anything better than to capture this captain barusky and liberate <name> . "
" we are bound to get into the port sooner or later , " answered <name> okopa .
" they are bringing up more siege guns every day .
if the russians wo n't give up we 'll batter the whole town down over their heads . "
" which <name> be a bad thing for <name> , " rejoined <name> .
" i do n't want him killed in the attempt to rescue him . "
chapter xxix from one difficulty to another " where is this going to end ? "
it was <name> who asked himself the question , as he walked up and down the narrow cell in which he had been confined in the prison at port <name> .
what had been written to <name> in the letter from pekin had been substantially correct .
<name> had aided <name> gow in numerous ways , and for this the chinaman had been extremely grateful and had promised to do all he could for the young captain should he manage to escape from the <unk> seaport .
then <name> gow had disappeared one night , and that was the last <name> saw of him .
three days later a guard entered the prison and announced that the prisoners were to be transferred to other quarters .
with his hands bound behind him , <name> was marched forth through a side street of port <name> , where stood an old building which had formerly been used as a market .
cells had been built in this structure , and into one of these he was thrust , the guard sarcastically telling him to make himself as comfortable as possible .
the young captain was sick in both body and mind and fast reaching that point where one becomes desperate and fit for any deed of daring .
more than once he was tempted to throw himself on the guard in an endeavor to <unk> the fellow and escape .
but he realized that if caught at this he would be immediately shot down .
day after day passed , and from outside the prisoner heard the dull booming of cannon .
occasionally a shell would explode close to the prison , causing a wild yell of alarm and a general rush by those outside .
there were flags over the prisons and over the hospitals , showing what manner of places they were , but , as said before , the japanese were at a loss to see what they were firing at , so many shots and shells went where they were not intended .
these <unk> were what caused the report to circulate that the mikado 's men were not fighting according to the rules of modern warfare , but were doing their best to <unk> the hospitals in which lay their own and the russian wounded .
it was a cold , raw day , with a touch of snow in the air , and <name> felt one of his desperate moods coming over him .
his hands and feet were free and he peered forth from the one narrow window that the cell contained .
all he could see beyond was a courtyard , surrounded by a stone wall .
" i wish i was out there  i 'd get over that wall somehow ! "
he muttered to himself .
the cell window was not over fifteen or sixteen inches wide and twice that in height .
the bars were of iron , but set in wooden frames but a few inches in thickness .
" a fellow might smash out those bars with the bench end , " he thought .
" but after that what ?
i reckon the guard in the courtyard would shoot me on sight .
i might try it at night . "
still in a desperate mood , <name> picked up the bench , a solid affair several feet long .
he made an imaginary lunge at the window bars with it .
" i 'll wager i could knock them out with one blow .
they   " <name> got no further , for at the moment a fearful explosion sounded somewhere overhead .
the explosion was followed by a crash and a wild yell of alarm .
a japanese shell had struck the top of the building , tearing away fully a quarter of the roof and sending the bricks and timbers flying in all directions .
" now is my chance ! "
he muttered , and without stopping to think twice he rammed the window bars as hard as he could with the bench .
a second and third blow followed , and down went the irons , carrying a portion of the window frame with them .
then through the opening leaped the young captain .
as he landed in the courtyard , he picked up a small log of wood lying handy .
a glance around told him that the guard was nowhere in sight , the russian having run to the other side of the building to note the damage done by the shell .
log in hand , <name> leaped quickly across the courtyard and placed the bit of wood up against the wall .
this gave him a footing , and in a twinkling he was on top of the wall .
but though he acted quickly a guard from the prison building saw him and ran forth gun in hand .
" halt ! "
came the command , in russian , and then , raising his weapon , the guard fired at <name> .
the bullet whistled over the young captain 's head , and without looking back to see who had fired it , he dropped on the other side of the wall .
then he <unk> up the street and around a corner .
<name> knew not where to go , but his one thought was to put distance between himself and the prison , and he hurried on and on , until he came to a barn which stood open .
into this he darted , to find the building empty of occupants .
the japanese had begun a general bombardment of port <name> and shot and shells were flying in all directions .
this being the case , the majority of the troops and the inhabitants were out of sight ,  hid away in cellars and <unk> .
nobody paid any attention to him and he was thus given ample time in which to think matters over and decide upon his next movement .
from the barn <name> moved to the building next door  which was a sort of dwelling and storehouse combined .
here , from the wide open doorway , he gazed at the scene of destruction before him .
it was full of horror and made him shiver .
" war is certainly a terrible thing , " he thought .
he saw some people running for their lives , and beheld one man go down struck in the back by a shell .
then he turned away to shut out the sight .
in one room of the warehouse he found an old overcoat and a slouch hat , and lost no time in donning these , both as a disguise and to keep himself warm .
then he hunted around for something to eat , but could not find a mouthful .
" i might have known there would be no food <unk> , " he told himself .
" did n't they say at the prison that they were slaughtering the horses just for the meat , and that butter and eggs were worth their weight in gold ?
i 'll be lucky to get bread and soup  especially as i have n't a dollar with which to pay for a meal . "
<name> was about to leave the warehouse when he saw a file of russian soldiers approaching .
with the soldiers were two officers , and as they came closer he recognized one as captain barusky .
" it was a bad thing to let that american escape , " said the captain to the other officer .
" if you catch sight of him , shoot him on the spot . "
" which we shall do with pleasure , " was the ready answer ; and then officers and soldiers passed on .
" i 've got to keep out of sight , that 's all there is to that , " reasoned <name> , grimly .
" if they catch me again it 's all up with me .
i wonder if it would be possible to get out of port <name> ?
<name> got out , but things were n't half so closely guarded as they are now . "
<name> waited until nightfall before leaving the warehouse .
then , keeping a constant lookout for russian soldiers , he sneaked along one street after another .
where to go he did not know , but he realized that he must have something to eat or he would starve .
presently he came to a small garden in the center of which was a <unk> residence .
on the <unk> was the name <name> <name> .
" <name> <name> ! "
<name> cried , half aloud .
" i wonder if that can be the gentleman <name> knew ?
if it is perhaps he <name> aid me . "
at first the young captain thought to ring the <unk> , but fearful of meeting the wrong person he resolved to investigate in a more private manner .
the side windows of the residence were curtained , but the curtains were only partly down .
going to one of the windows he peered inside .
in a neatly furnished sitting room sat a young <name> and a russian soldier .
they were arguing about something  money matters as far as <name> could make out .
the young <name> did not wish to give the soldier the money and he insisted upon having it .
while <name> gazed at the scene , the russian soldier leaped up , grasped the young <name> by the shoulders and shook her roughly .
" do n't ! "
screamed the young <name> , in english .
" let me go ! "
" i want the money ! "
answered the soldier , in his native tongue .
he was a cossack and of brutal features .
the young <name> was pretty and she was helpless , and this combination was more than the young captain could resist .
regardless of consequences , he shoved up the window and leaped inside the apartment .
" keep your hands off of that young <name> ! "
he cried , and catching the cossack by the shoulder he threw him backward .
" do n't you know how to treat a <name> when you meet her , you big brute ? "
the cossack was startled , first because he had not expected the interruption and secondly because he had no business to be in the mansion .
he gave one look at <name> and then rushed out into the hallway and left the premises with all possible speed .
as soon as the cossack was gone the young <name> and <name> stared at each other .
she started to speak , but stopped suddenly .
" excuse me for coming in as i did , but i thought it was necessary , " said the young captain .
" i guess that fellow had no business here . "
" you are right , sir .
papa is away , and he wanted me to give him money .
he must have known i was alone in the house . "
" are you miss <name> ? "
" i am .
but you have the advantage of me . "
" i know it .
i am captain <name> <name> .
perhaps you know an old friend of mine , <name> pennington .
he knows your father , i believe . "
" oh , yes , i have met captain pennington .
they tell me he is now in the japanese army . "
" he is . "
<name> paused and looked at the young <name> keenly .
" miss <name> , can i trust you ? "
he asked , abruptly .
" what do you mean ? "
" i <name> tell you , " and in a few brief words he related his story , to which <name> <name> listened with close attention .
" you were lucky to escape from that prison ! "
she cried , when he had finished .
" to be sure i <name> assist you as far as i can .
papa is away on business , but i expect him back in two or three hours .
we have n't much on hand to eat , but such as there is you are welcome to . "
" i 'm hungry enough to eat anything , " said <name> , with a little smile .
" then come with me to the dining room , captain <name> , and i <name> prepare supper . "
" you have n't any servants now , i suppose ? "
" no ; every one of them has deserted us . "
they entered the dining room , and the young <name> asked <name> to close the shutters .
while he was doing this she prepared such a meal as the larder of the house afforded .
it was not much , but he did not complain , and he thanked her warmly for giving what he felt she could ill afford to set before him .
the meal finished , they sat down to await the coming of mr. <name> .
while doing this <name> related some of his experiences in the army and the young <name> told of the horrors of the siege .
" one can not understand it unless you are in the midst of it , " she said .
" papa says business is at a standstill , the hospitals are filled with the sick and the wounded , and we are in constant dread that the next moment <name> be our last .
the suspense is so great that in one or two cases the inhabitants have gone crazy . "
" i can well believe that , miss <name> .
during the war in the philippines i saw   " <name> paused , as a heavy footstep sounded on the porch of the residence .
other footsteps followed , and then came a loud knock on the door .
" open here ! "
demanded a voice in russian .
" open , in the name of the czar ! "
chapter xxx a surprise for <name> as the days passed , the watch upon port <name> from the sea became closer and closer .
admiral togo gave strict orders that no ships should be allowed to enter or come from the harbor under any circumstances , and each commander of a warship was on his mettle , knowing full well that if he was derelict in his duty he would speedily hear from his superior in a manner far from pleasant .
<unk> became something of a monotony to <name> and <name> , and after several weeks had passed both wished something would happen .
" i 'd rather put up with a stiff sea fight than this , " declared the young gunner 's mate .
" right ye are , lad , " replied the old yankee tar .
" ai n't no use o ' bein' ready for a <unk> if it ai n't comin ' .
as it now is , life in the navy ai n't no more <unk> ' nor life on the old columbia . "
during that time <name> received a letter from captain ponsberry , similar in contents to that sent to <name> .
the japanese government had released the cargo of the schooner and then bought the same at a good round price .
the ship had also been released , captain ponsberry having to pay a nominal sum for this action .
" i think the captain is lucky to get off so easily , " said <name> .
" i suppose the japanese government might have scooped in everything . "
" well , the japs think it best to remain friendly to the united states , " answered <name> , and it is likely that the old sailor was more than half right .
cold weather had come in <name> and work on deck was far from pleasant .
yet each man on the shohirika had to do his full duty as before , and , be it said to their credit , not a sailor or <name> did any shirking .
gun drills and various exercises were kept up constantly .
one day the warship ran close to a big trading brig bound for hong-kong .
as was the custom , the brig stopped to allow the commander of the shohirika to make certain that she was not carrying <unk> of war for russia or had no intentions of running the blockade .
while this examination was going on , <name> and <name> chanced to come on deck , curious to have a look at the stranger .
" about as big a brig as i ever see in these parts , " was the yankee <unk> comment .
" she must <name> a <unk> cargo . "
" yes , and a lot of men to man her , " answered <name> .
" think of hoisting and <unk> such sails as she carries ! "
the two vessels had come fairly close to each other , and our friends continued to survey the brig with interest .
then <name> gave a cry .
" oh , <name> , i wish i had a glass ! "
" why ? "
" unless i am mistaken , there is shamhaven on the deck of that ship ! "
" no ! "
<name> pointed with his hand .
" does n't that look like him ? "
he continued .
" <unk> me , if i do n't think you 're right , lad .
wait , i 'll get a glass an ' make certain ! "
the old tar knew where he could borrow a glass , and in a minute more he returned , and both took a brief look through the instrument .
" it is shamhaven ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" and look , there is peterson coming from the <unk> ! "
" that 's so .
what ye goin ' to do about it ? "
" tell the officer of the deck .
they <name> n't get off with my money if i can help it . "
rushing away , <name> soon acquainted the proper officer with what he had discovered  telling as much about the robbery as seemed necessary .
the officer was interested , and , what was even more to the point , liked the young american .
" do you wish to go to yonder ship and confront the men ? "
he asked .
" try me and see ! "
answered <name> , excitedly .
" i mean , yes , sir , " he stammered .
" and <name> you let <name> striker go , too ? "
the officer agreed , and soon another small boat put off from the warship , and <name> and <name> , with the officer , were speedily landed on the deck of the brig .
" you 're a fine rascal , to <name> me ! "
cried <name> , rushing up to shamhaven .
" and to <name> captain ponsberry , too ! "
shamhaven had not expected this encounter , and for the moment he was <unk> .
he gazed from <name> to <name> as if they were ghosts .
" i  i  who are you , anyway ? "
he stammered .
" i do n't know you , " he added , striving to regain his composure .
" yes , you do know me , and you know <name> striker , too , " answered the young gunner 's mate .
" what does this mean ? "
asked the captain of the brig , while a number of others looked on with interest .
" i 'll tell you what it means , sir , " said <name> , and did so .
" he has got to give up my money belt and my money , and give up captain <unk> money , too . "
at this moment peterson came up and was promptly collared by <name> .
" stop !
do n't you vos touch me ! "
cried peterson .
" i ai n't noddings done , no . "
" you helped shamhaven to <name> me , " came from <name> .
" no , he done it all alone !
i no touch noddings ! "
" oh , shut up ! "
roared shamhaven , in disgust .
" i never robbed anybody .
if you lost your money peterson must have taken it . "
a quarrel ensued between the evildoers , in the midst of which came a cry from the shohirika .
" an enemy is in sight ! "
at once all attention was turned to the warship .
scarcely a minute elapsed when a signal was displayed : " a battleship , and she is trying to escape up the coast ! "
" to the boats ! "
roared the japanese officer on the deck of the brig .
" to the boats at once !
this investigation <name> have to be postponed .
we shall expect you to remain as you are "  the latter words to the captain of the big brig .
" as you <name> , " was the smooth answer .
a rush was made for the two small boats , <name> and <name> being hustled along with the crowd .
soon they put off for the warship , which was already preparing to follow the russian battleship that had been seen .
" i did n't get my money , after all , " grumbled the youth .
" but perhaps i 'll get it later  if that ship of the enemy does n't sink us , " he added .
as soon as they were on board of the shohirika again , the cruiser started after the battleship .
but the enemy had a good lead , and it was some time before the japanese warship could command a full head of steam , which meant everything to her .
then , when steam was to be had in plenty , there came a breakdown in the engine room , causing a delay of twenty minutes .
" we 'll never catch her ,  at least , not to-day , " said <name> , and he was right .
darkness found the battleship still three miles away .
half a dozen shots were fired at her , but none took effect .
then night ended the pursuit .
in the morning nothing was to be seen of the enemy and those on the japanese warship were much depressed , for they had fancied that an encounter might add greatly to their laurels .
but shortly before noon the lookout announced the approach of another ship .
" a russian cruiser ! "
was the cry .
this was correct  the vessel was the auxiliary cruiser , <unk> , formerly a steamer in the siberian trade .
she was manned by a fierce and <unk> body of sailors and marines , and carried a first and second battery of no mean proportions .
" i 'll wager we have got some work cut out for us now , " said <name> , and he was right .
finding she could not run away from the shohirika the russian auxiliary cruiser came steaming up and let drive at close range ,  a broadside that raked the japanese warship from end to end with deadly effect .
the shohirika answered immediately , and both the steering wheel and the rudder were smashed on the enemy 's ship .
" phew !
but this is hot work ! "
panted <name> , as all those around the gun worked like trojans .
" an ' it 's going to be hotter ! "
ejaculated <name> .
he sighted the piece with care .
" there , <name> <name> , let her go ! "
and he pressed the electric button .
bang !  went the gun with a roar that was deafening .
then the breech was thrown open and the smoke rolled out , filling the air with a smell that made them cough and sneeze .
but nobody stopped work .
in a trice the gun was cleaned and cooled and another shell pushed into place , and then the firing was repeated .
" she 's coming alongside ! "
was the announcement from on deck .
" all hands to repel boarders ! "
" a hand-to-hand fight ! "
cried <name> , and scarcely had the words been uttered when there came a bump that hurled half the sailors flat .
up they sprang , and as order after order was delivered the marines and others ran for their guns and cutlasses , while the officers saw to it that their pistols were ready for use .
a wild , maddening yell came from the deck of the russian ship , as marines and sailors poured over the side .
an answering <unk> issued from the japanese , and they met the first onslaught with vigor .
then came a fierce tramping over the deck , as the two conflicting parties moved first to one side and then the other .
" we are ordered up ! "
cried <name> , a few minutes later .
" here is where we have got to fight for it , <name> ! "
" right you are , lad .
do your best , and trust to heaven for the rest ! "
was the yankee tar 's reply .
and then , cutlasses in hand , both mounted to the deck , to engage in the <unk> hand-to-hand encounter either of them had ever experienced .
chapter xxxi a call to repel boarders it was a battle <name> from the start and for some time neither side had an advantage .
pistol shot was met by pistol shot , and a rifle gun placed on the upper deck of the russian warship was balanced in execution by a similar gun mounted on the shohirika .
the slaughter created by both weapons was frightful , a dozen or more going down on either side each time a gun was discharged .
when <name> and <name> came out on desk the spectacle was enough to make the blood of the youth run cold , and it was only his previous experience in warfare which rendered him capable of doing what he knew was his duty .
" charge on them ! "
came the cry in japanese .
" kill them , or drive them back to their ship !
<unk> !  " " <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !  " was the yell .
" hurrah for japan ! "
the japanese had not expected a hand-to-hand fight and the closing in of the enemy aroused them as they had never been aroused before .
for the first time <name> saw the sailors and marines awakened to their full fighting fury  a fury in which every japanese <unk> death and thinks that to die is <name> for himself , his family , and his emperor .
they leaped on the russians with a ferocity that was appalling , and that first shock sent the czar 's men back to the deck from which they had come .
but the russians were likewise aroused , and with cheers and yells they came on once more , leaping over the bodies of those who had fallen , and meeting shot with shot and cutlass stroke with cutlass stroke .
officers and men fought side by side , and many went down to a common death .
by instinct <name> and <name> kept close together , with the others from <name> 's gun near at hand , and <name> <name> and <name> <name> not far away .
each used his cutlass as best he could , <unk> off the blows of the enemy and dealing cuts whenever a chance appeared .
<name> was glad that he had learned to use a cutlass so well , and soon found himself the match of almost any russian who challenged him .
the fighting was now spread over the decks of both vessels , which were hooked together tightly and pounding broadside at every swell of the ocean .
to attempt to blow up either ship would have been fatal probably to both  one dragging down the other  so no such attempt was made .
while the fighting was at its height , <name> suddenly found himself face to face with a russian lieutenant of marines .
the fellow had a pistol in his hand , and as <name> raised his cutlass to strike , he dropped the weapon on a level with the youth 's head and pulled the trigger .
had the bullet sped as intended it is likely <name> would have been killed .
but just as the trigger fell , <name> , who was at <name> 's side , knocked the pistol to one side with his cutlass and the bullet merely grazed <name> 's hair .
then <name> leaped forward and gave the russian lieutenant a thrust in the side which put the fellow out of the fight instantly .
for fully fifteen minutes the battle had now raged and it was growing hotter each instant .
all of the available men on each ship were in the fray , and the cries and yells which resounded were deafening .
" we certainly ca n't keep this fight up much longer ! "
panted <name> .
he had a cut on his left hand and one in the shoulder , but kept on with dogged determination .
" well , we ai n't goin ' to surrender ! "
grunted <name> .
" it 's fight or die , i guess ! "
and he leaped forward once more .
two tall russians were directly in front of the old yankee gunner , and both fell upon him with their cutlasses at the same instant .
<name> was capable of <unk> off the weapon of one , but he was no match for the pair , and it speedily looked as if they would surely kill him .
" back with ye ! "
he yelled , and swung his cutlass as rapidly as he could , but they crowded him still closer and then one made a thrust at his face and another at his body .
it was at this critical moment that <name> , who had been engaged with somebody else , saw his old war chum 's predicament .
with a leap he gained <name> 's side , and down came his cutlass with a sweeping blow on the wrist of one of the enemy .
the russian dropped his cutlass to the deck and staggered back , his hand almost severed from his arm .
then <name> slashed the other russian across the cheek , and both of the enemy hurried back behind the other fighters .
" good fer you , <name> ! "
panted <name> , when he could speak .
" they had me about cornered ! "
" these fellows certainly know how to put up a stiff fight . "
" you 're wounded yourself .
better go below . "
" no , i 'm going to see it out .
why do n't you go down yourself ? "
" it ai n't in me , thet 's why , " answered the old yankee gunner .
again came a fierce onslaught from the russians .
but the japanese now had another rifle gun in place , and sharpshooters were crowding the fighting tops .
the latter picked off the russian officers , and this created a momentary confusion .
then came a sudden order to unlock the two ships and this was done .
" the russian ship is going down ! "
was the yell , and the news proved true .
an explosion below decks had torn a hole in the russian <unk> bottom and she began to sink rapidly .
the scene was now indescribable .
both the russians and the japanese on the doomed vessel endeavored to reach the deck of the shohirika .
in this struggle the majority of the russians received the worst of it , and fully fifty of them , including not a few wounded , remained on board when the doomed warship took her final plunge beneath the waters of the sea .
eighteen japanese were likewise drowned , including two under officers .
" surrender , or we <name> drive you over the side ! "
was the command from the japanese , and utterly disheartened by the loss of their ship , the russians threw down their arms ; and the fierce and bloody contest was at an end .
the common sailors were driven forward and chained together or bound with ropes , and the officers were grouped near the stern , where a formal surrender was made by the captain of the lost ship giving up his sword .
this formality over , the japanese set to work at once , cleaning up the deck and caring for the wounded as well as the hospital accommodations of the shohirika would permit .
" i never wish to see another fight like that , " was <name> 's comment , when he had washed up and had his wounds dressed .
" it was simply a slaughter ! "
" right you are , lad , " answered <name> .
" an ' i reckon i 'm a-goin ' to <name> the scars o ' it down to my grave . "
the old yankee gunner had received several severe wounds , and he was glad enough to have <name> swing his hammock for him and lie down to rest .
the battle over , the captain of the shohirika sailed away , to look for the big brig once more and to report to the flagship of the fleet .
but the brig had taken time by the forelock and left for parts unknown .
" i suppose that is the last of shamhaven and peterson and my money , " said <name> , when this news reached him .
" i wish we had met that brig a week ago . "
" oh , it 's possible we may see her again , " said <name> , cheerfully .
" but it gets me that she ran away , unless she had something to run for . "
" she must have been carrying some <unk> of war , <name> . "
" it ai n't unlikely , lad .
well , she 's gone , an ' it ai n't no use to cry over spilt milk .
when you write to captain ponsberry you can tell him ye saw them two rascals an ' thet 's all the good it did . "
" do you know what i 'm thinking ? "
" well ? "
" i 'm thinking that brig was bound for port <name> , and she 'll slip into that port some dark and <name> night . "
" it 's a risky piece o ' business .
either our ships or the mines are likely to blow her up . "
" that is true .
but the russians at the port must be getting desperate , and they 'll most likely pay any kind of a price for supplies .
a captain who ran the blockade successfully could make a fortune , " returned <name> .
the young gunner 's mate was right in his surmise .
the big brig was a russian vessel in disguise and loaded to her fullest capacity with supplies for the <unk> seaport .
she had been fitted out at <unk> , but had taken a wide sea course , so as to pretend to have set sail from nagasaki .
several russian shipping merchants were interested in the venture , which was a private one , and among the number was <name> snokoff .
from captain barusky , snokoff had heard that fabulous prices could be obtained for needed commodities at port <name> , and he had invested nearly every <unk> he possessed in the enterprise .
if the vessel succeeded in reaching port <name> , captain barusky was to undertake the disposal of the goods shipped in snokoff 's name , and then the two were to divide the profits .
the big brig had come close to being wrecked off the coast of japan and during a <name> had run down a fishing smack containing shamhaven , peterson , and two japanese .
one japanese had been drowned , and the three others from the smack had been made to join the crew of the big brig .
this was agreeable to shamhaven and peterson , who did not wish to remain near nagasaki or at any place where captain ponsberry or <name> would be likely to discover them .
chapter xxxii fall of port <name>  conclusion " open , in the name of the czar ! "
such was the command which startled both <name> and <name> <name> , and for the moment each gazed at the other in horror , not knowing what to say or do .
" i must get away from here ! "
whispered the young captain , but scarcely had he spoken when there came a crash , and the front door of the residence swung in .
then half a dozen russians poured into the house .
" there he is , as i suspected ! "
said one , an officer from the prison .
" we 'll see that you do not escape again , " he added to <name> , grimly .
in the midst of the excitement <name> <name> arrived .
but he could do nothing for the young captain , and was glad that he was left to protect his daughter .
" we ought also to take her , " said the prison official .
" she did wrong to harbor this prisoner . "
and then , without further ado , <name> was marched back to the place from which he had escaped such a short while before .
after that the time passed dismally enough for the young american .
for having run away he was put on the most miserable fare the prison afforded , the food being often so vile he could not touch it .
whenever he attempted to protest he was met with kicks and blows .
" they might as well kill me and be done with it , " he thought .
" oh , how i wish the japs would take the city and give me back my <name> ! "
in those days port <name> became a most uncomfortable place for all living there .
the japanese army was pressing forward steadily , and army and navy did everything possible to destroy the shipping in the harbor and make the various forts untenable .
shots and shells were hurled into the city at all hours of the day and night , until living there became worse than a nightmare .
among the soldiers scurvy became prevalent , until the hospitals could not accommodate the sick and the dying .
nothing was done to clean up the streets , and the rubbish lay many feet deep over the sidewalks .
practically all of the shops were closed , for they had next to nothing to sell .
the main article of food was rice , and to cook this many old buildings had to be <unk> in order to procure necessary firewood .
as <name> approached the suffering of the poor became so intense that riots broke out and to maintain order not a few were shot down .
such was the condition in the city .
outside , to the northward , the fighting went on week after week .
so many soldiers were killed upon both sides that to bury the dead became impossible , and thousands were left where they had fallen , to become the prey of vultures , or to <unk> and fill the locality with a stench that was as <unk> as it was deadly !
such are the horrors of modern warfare .
the demands for universal peace can not come any too quickly .
in the advance on port <name> , <name> did his full share of the fighting .
the japanese were now struggling for the possession of what was known as <unk> hill , a <name> elevation which was not fortified but which was in the direct line of russian fire .
the top of <unk> hill commanded a fine view of port <name> and its harbor , and it was this view the japanese needed , in order to make their shell fire most effective .
the battle for <unk> hill is one which <name> be long remembered .
the japanese fought with a desperation impossible to describe , and when the hill was captured , general <unk> sent out nearly all his available men to <unk> it .
but this could not be accomplished , and late in december the japanese stormed the inner defenses of the russian chain of forts , killing nearly all of the brave defenders who dared to oppose them .
then tons upon tons of shot and shell were sent into port <name> and over the harbor once again , until the locality became little short of an inferno .
nearly all the shipping was destroyed , and so many buildings were set on fire that to stem the conflagration became all but impossible .
the end came on new year 's day , 1905  ten months after the famous siege began .
to hold out longer seemed impossible , and to avoid further carnage general <unk> called a council of war and sent a message to general <unk> offering to <unk> .
" port <name> has surrendered ! "
the news flew from one japanese regiment to another , and soon the warships were sending the message from vessel to vessel .
for once the japanese showed their real feelings , and " <unk> !
<unk> !  " rent the air again and again .
" long life to the mikado !
port <name> is ours once more ! "
" it is a <unk> victory ! "
cried <name> , when he heard the news .
" yes , lad , and i trust it brings this bloody war to a close , " came from <name> .
" they say general <unk> blew up the warships remaining in the harbor . "
" he could n't have had many left , " returned the old yankee gunner .
" the army and the navy have about battered everything to bits . "
and in this surmise <name> was correct .
the fall of port <name> caused <unk> consternation in russia , while the people of japan were correspondingly elated .
because of the gallant defense of the place , the japanese made generous terms with those who had surrendered , much to the satisfaction of the world at large .
many had predicted a universal butchery , but nothing of the sort occurred , and the russian sick and wounded were given every possible attention .
after the fall of the port <name> was permitted to go ashore some miles above the town , and he managed to locate <name> , and then learned for the first time that <name> was a prisoner in the captured place .
" a prisoner ! "
he ejaculated .
" oh , <name> , we must find him and have him released ! "
" that is just what i have been thinking , but i do n't know exactly how to go at it , <name> . "
" there ought to be some way of doing these things .
we might interview one of the generals and   who is that coming this way ? "
" why , it 's <name> himself ! "
cried <name> .
" <name> ! "
screamed <name> , and ran forward to meet his brother .
soon they were in each other 's arms , and then <name> received an equally warm greeting .
" we were released this morning , " said <name> .
" i can tell you i was mighty glad of it .
i have n't had a meal fit to eat in weeks . "
" well , you shall have the best our larder affords , " said <name> .
" my , but you 're a sight for sore eyes ! "
he continued .
" do n't say a word ! "
came from <name> .
two tears were glistening in his honest eyes .
" it 's almost too good to be true ! "
* * * * * here let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this tale of the naval and military adventures " at the fall of port <name> . "
after the surrender of the city the army in that vicinity , and also the fleet near the harbor , had but little to do outside of caring for the sick and wounded and disposing of the thousands of prisoners .
the russian officers were allowed to go on parole and the prisoners were transported to japan .
many of the mines in the harbor were taken up , so that ships might come and go in safety .
<name> was anxious to learn what had become of shamhaven and peterson , and through the japanese guards stationed in port <name> located the rascally sailors at a cheap boarding-house .
both were made prisoners , and <name> got back a portion of the money stolen from captain ponsberry and himself .
it was learned that the big brig had been destroyed by the japanese shell fire , so that <name> snokoff lost everything he placed in the venture .
" well , it served him right , " said <name> , when he heard of this .
" he is responsible for the time <name> spent in prison . "
what had become of captain barusky was at first a mystery .
but at last it was learned that he had sneaked aboard of a transport filled with wounded soldiers and bound for <unk> .
he pretended to be wounded himself , and was given medical attention until the trick was discovered , when he was treated as a coward .
as soon as <unk> was reached he disappeared , and that was the last seen or heard of him for some time .
" we are well rid of that fellow , " said <name> .
" i <name> the russians read him out of their army .
he is n't fit to hold a commission . "
" what do you imagine <name> be the next move in this war ? "
questioned <name> .
" it is hard to tell .
i think they <name> try to take <unk> , for one thing . "
" russia is going to send out more warships , " put in <name> .
" if they come this way , it may mean more fighting for me . "
" well , i reckon you 'll do your duty , if you are put to it , " answered <name> , with a smile .
" and so <name> you do yours , " came from <name> .
" we 'll all try to do our duty , " broke in <name> .
" we did n't join the army and the navy to <name> back .
just the same , i 'd enjoy a bit of a rest just now . "
the others agreed that the rest would be beneficial all around .
it was given to them ; and here , for the present at least , we <name> leave them , wishing them the best of good luck in the future .

grosset & dunlap publishers new york copyright , 1901 , by the <unk> company [ illustration : defending the fort . ]
preface .
" boys of the fort " is a complete story in itself , but forms the fifth volume of a line of works issued under the general title of " flag of freedom series . "
in <unk> this tale i had it in mind to acquaint my young readers with the ins and outs of military life at one of our western forts of to-day , showing what both officers and privates are called upon to do , and what troubles the indians and the bad men of that locality are still in the habit of making .
the field is one about which little has been written , although abounding in interest , and one which is worthy the attention of all who have the proper development of our country at heart .
to some , certain scenes in this book may appear <unk> , yet such is far from being the case .
in this wild territory there are those who have lived all their lives beyond the pale of civilization , men who grow up dwarfed and crooked in mind , and who resent every effort made to better their condition .
the young captain is a fine specimen of the wide-awake american army officer , yet he is no more brave and dashing than are thousands of others , officers and privates , who serve under our flag of freedom .
he is trained to do his duty , and he simply does it , regardless of possible consequences .
once more i take this opportunity to thank my young friends for the kindness with which they have received my former stories , and i earnestly <name> this present tale merits equal commendation .

boys of the fort .
chapter i .
bound for the fort .
" how many miles have we still to ride , benson ? "
" about fifty , <name> .
but the last half is pretty much uphill , lad . "
" can we make the fort by to-morrow night ? "
" well , we can try , " answered the old scout , who sat astride of a coal-black horse and rode slightly in advance of his two youthful companions .
" it <name> depend somewhat on what the weather does . "
" why , do you think it is going to rain ? "
put in darry germain .
" i 'm sure it looks clear enough . "
" aint no telling what the weather <name> do in this valley , " answered <name> benson .
" it may stay clear for a week , but to me the signs do n't exactly p'int that way , " and he shook his head gravely .
" a little rain would n't hurt , " said <name> moore .
" a couple of miles back the road was fearfully <name> . "
" the trouble is , when it rains out here it rains , " answered the old scout .
" the clouds come <unk> over yonder mountains , and inside of half an hour you 'd fancy the water was going to drown out everything . "
" then if it rains we 'll have to put up somewhere , " said darry germain .
" aint no cabin on this trail short of <name> leeson 's place , twenty miles this side of the fort .
if we can get that far i reckon we can make the fort . "
" then where <name> we stop to-night ? "
asked darry with interest .
" at the <name> hotel  if the sky is clear , " said <name> benson , with a laugh at what he considered his little joke .
" you mean in the open , under the stars ! "
cried the boy ; and , as the old scout nodded , he went on : " that <name> be nice .
i 've been wanting to camp out in regular trapper style ever since we left <unk> . "
" so have i , " put in <name> moore .
" but i do n't know as i care to camp out and get soaked . "
" if it rains we 'll find some kind of shelter , " answered benson .
" but come , let us make the most of the daylight while it lasts , " and he urged his steed forward , and the two boys did the same .
the three were pursuing their way along a gap in the <name> mountains , where the so-called valley was broken up by <name> <unk> , walls of rock , and dense patches of forest and underbrush .
it was midsummer , and the hot air was filled with the scent of green growing things .
deep in the forest the song-birds sang gayly and the wild animals had full play to come and go as they pleased , for to get at them in those vast fastnesses was next to impossible .
the party of three had left the town of <unk> four days before .
they were bound for fort <name> ,  so named after <name> <name> , the celebrated scout and indian fighter ,  and <name> benson carried messages of importance to colonel fairfield , the commandant at the fort .
<name> moore and darry germain were cousins , and both were boys of sixteen , well built and well trained in outdoor athletic sports .
<name> came from chicago and darry from st. <name> , and each had graduated from his local high school but a few weeks before .
it was while darry was spending a brief vacation with his cousin <name> that a plan for visiting the fort was formed .
<name> 's older brother , <name> , was a west point graduate and a captain at the fort , and he wrote on stating that he had received permission to have <name> visit him , and darry could come too if he desired .
colonel fairfield was an old friend of both families , and promised to treat the lads well should they make the trip .
" hurrah !
just the thing ! "
<name> had cried .
" of course you 'll go , darry .
we could n't have a grander outing . "
" i 'll go if father and mother <name> let me , " had been darry 's answer , and he had at once written home concerning the affair .
two weeks later the boys were off , the parents of each <unk> them to be careful , and wishing them the best of luck .
the journey westward as far as the <unk> of <unk> had occurred without special incident .
they had been told to hire a guide at this point , and while looking for a man had fallen in with <name> benson .
benson knew captain <name> moore well , and he at once promised to take the boys along with him and do the best he could by them .
" you 'll want good hosses , " benson had said , and had aided them in selecting their animals and in getting together the necessary outfit .
the start was made one fine morning in <name> , and all three of the party were in the best of spirits .
the four days in the mountains had opened the eyes of both lads .
the traveling had been rather hard , yet they had enjoyed every minute of the journey .
they had stopped once to do some fishing , and benson had brought down a small mountain deer .
at night they had put up at the cabins of hunters and trappers , and before retiring had listened to thrilling tales of adventures with wild beasts and with the indians .
but now <name> was anxious to get to the fort and see his brother , from whom he had been separated for nearly two years .
darry was also anxious to reach the <unk> , to meet not only his cousin <name> , but likewise colonel fairfield , who was an old friend not easily forgotten .
once at the fort the two boys felt that a vacation full of fun and pleasure would follow .
never once did they dream of the perils which awaited them in that wild region , which was not as civilized as it was to become a handful of years later .
" it seems to me it is growing hotter , " remarked darry , after riding a quarter of a mile in silence .
" it is growing hotter , " answered the old scout .
" and that makes me more certain than ever that a storm 's at hand . "
" we 'll have to take what comes , " said <name> .
" but i did <name> we 'd reach the fort by to-morrow . "
on they went , around a bend of the trail and over some rough rocks , where the horses had to step with care , for fear of slipping into a gully on the left .
then they reached a patch of timber and plunged beneath the <unk> trees .
here it was both dark and cool , and darry breathed a long sigh of relief .
" how delicious ! "
he murmured .
" it 's almost like going into a cave .
benson , there must be lots of caves in these mountains , " he went on reflectively .
" there are , " answered the old scout .
" i 've been in a score or more . "
" i should like to explore a big cave , " came from <name> .
" it would be a novelty to me . "
" you may get the chance , lad , " said benson ; " and get it soon . "
" what do you mean ?
are we going to ride by a cave ? "
" there are a dozen or more ahead , and we may have to seek one of 'em for shelter .
do you hear that ? "
benson threw back his head to listen , and the two boys did likewise .
from a great distance came the rumble of thunder , echoing and <unk> throughout the mountains .
to the westward the sun was hidden by a dense mass of black clouds which grew more ominous each instant .
" the storm is coming , sure enough , " muttered <name> .
" what do you propose ? "
" we 'll ride on a bit , lad .
it wo n't hit us right away .
come ! "
the horses were urged forward at an increased speed , and soon they passed the patch of timber and came out to where a thick fringe of brush skirted a long , high <name> .
the sky was now dark on every side , and the wind was rising with a dull , humming sound .
" we 'll catch it in a few minutes ! "
cried benson ; and hardly had he spoken when the big drops came splashing down , hitting the broad leaves in the underbrush with resounding <unk> .
the old scout continued to lead , and presently he turned to the left , where the <name> parted .
here was an opening , lined on either side with rocks and dirt , and a short distance further was the entrance to a cave of unknown depths .
" we 'll stop here , " said the old scout , leaping to the ground , followed by the boys .
" this aint the best place in the world , but it 's better than the open , in such a blow as is coming . "
he was right about the blow  already the wind was rising , and hardly had the three led their horses into the cave , the entrance to which was over a dozen feet high , when there came a crashing through the timber left behind , which sent many a frail limb and sapling to the ground and carried the leaves and twigs in all directions .
" i 'm glad we did n't stay in the woods ! "
cried darry .
" we 'd be in danger of falling trees . "
" and lightning too , " added <name> .
" oh , my !
look at that ! "
he continued , as a blinding flash lit up the heavens .
" that must have struck somewhere . "
" we 'll go back a little , " said old benson .
" the lightning is just as bad here as it is in the woods .
wait till i get a torch . "
pine was plentiful in that locality , and soon he had a knot which was full of pitch and which burned well when a match was applied to it .
with the torch in hand , he led the way further into the cave , and the boys followed with their animals .
chapter ii .
caves in the mountain .
the two boys had expected to find the large cave damp and unwholesome , and they were surprised when they learned how dry the flooring and the sides were , and how pure the air was .
there was no breeze in the place , but a gentle draught kept the air stirring .
of course the atmosphere was much cooler than it had been outside .
hardly had the travelers gained the center of the first chamber of the cave , when the storm outside burst in all its fury .
the lightning and thunder were almost incessant , and the rain came down in broad sheets which completely obliterated the landscape .
" it 's little short of a flood , " said darry , after having gone to the mouth of the cave to investigate .
" the water is already two or three inches deep on the trail . "
" well , such a downpour ca n't last long , " returned <name> .
" it 's only a shower , or a <unk> . "
" no , it 's a regular rain , and it 's good for all night , " answered the old scout .
" all night ! "
" yes , lad , and we 'll be lucky if it do n't last through the morning , too .
it do n't rain very often out here , you see , but when it does it tries to make up for lost time . "
" then we 'll have to camp right here , wo n't we ? "
" to be sure .
even if it did let up , you would n't want to camp in the wet timber . "
" then we might as well start up a fire , " came from darry , in something of a disappointed tone .
" i was hoping we 'd be able to camp under the stars just once before we got to the fort . "
" perhaps you 'll get a chance to go out after you 're at the fort , " said the old scout , by way of comfort .
" yes , we 'll start a fire , if we can find any dry wood . "
the horses were tied up between some rocks , and then the three searched around .
at the entrance to the cave was a mass of brush and tree limbs which previous storms had sent in that direction , and from this they gathered enough for a good-sized fire .
it did not take long for the brush to blaze up , sending the sparks to the roof of the cave and throwing fantastic shadows all about them .
" i declare , the fire makes the cave look quite <unk> ! "
was <unk> comment , as he threw himself down on a flat rock with his blanket under him .
" staying here wo n't be so <unk> as i anticipated . "
" i 'm going to explore the cave , now i am here , " returned darry .
" who knows but what i might locate a gold mine ! "
" you be careful of where you go , " cautioned old benson .
" these caves are full of pitfalls , and now you two boys are with me i do n't want anything to happen to you .
if something did happen , neither captain moore nor colonel fairfield would forgive me . "
" to be sure we 'll be careful , benson , " answered darry .
" there 'd be no fun in getting hurt  even if we did locate a gold mine . "
" you wo n't find any gold mine here .
this ground was <unk> years ago  before even the fort was located .
i came out here once myself , with a miner named hooker brown .
hooker was dead certain there was gold here , but although we stayed here about two weeks nosing around we never got even a smell of the yellow metal . "
" well , we 'll have a look around , anyway , " said <name> .
" but we must get good torches first . "
pine knots were procured and lit ; and , with another caution from the scout to be careful , they set off , leaving benson to care for the horses and prepare such an evening meal as their stores afforded .
luckily the scout had brought down half a dozen good-sized birds , and these he now prepared to broil in true <name> style .
the front chamber of the cave was somewhat <unk> , and behind this were several other irregular apartments , running down to a passageway which wound in and out between jagged rocks almost impossible to climb or explore in any manner .
at a distance could be heard the trickling of water , but where this came from , or where it went to , nobody in the cave could imagine .
the boys advanced from one opening to another with care , one with his torch held high , that they might see ahead , and the other with the light close to the ground , to warn them of a possible pitfall .
" a regiment of soldiers could quarter in here , " observed darry , as they pushed on .
" what a defense it would make ! "
" an enemy could fire right into the entrance .
and , besides , supposing the enemy started to smoke you out ?
i can smell the smoke from the camp-fire away back here . "
at last the two boys reached the passageway back of the rear chamber , and here came to a halt .
the dropping water could be plainly heard , and <name> flashed his torch in several directions in the <name> of catching sight of the stream .
" i 'm going to climb the rocks , " he said , after a pause .
" perhaps there is another opening behind them . "
" remember what benson said , and be careful , " cautioned his cousin .
" there is no use in taking a risk for nothing . "
" yes , i 'll be careful , " answered <name> , and crawled forward with care .
darry held his torch as high up as possible , to light the way .
the youth had advanced a distance of fifty feet when he came to a turn in the passageway .
here the side walls were not over two yards apart , while the roof could be touched with ease .
thinking the walking better at this point , <name> struck out once more .
the flare from his torch showed him something of a chamber ahead , and the water sounded closer than ever .
but hardly had the lad taken a dozen steps when the smooth rock upon which he was advancing tilted up , sending him headlong .
as he went down the torch was knocked from his hand .
then he slid forward into the darkness .
" help ! "
he managed to cry .
" help ! "
" what 's up ? "
came from darry , but the words were drowned out in the crashing of one stone against another .
in the meantime <name> had fallen , he knew not whither .
he landed on some soft ground , turned over and slid along , and then took a second drop .
a stone fell beside him and pinned his jacket to the ground .
for the moment the lad was too dazed and bewildered to do anything but try to get back his breath .
then , as it gradually dawned upon him that he was not hurt in the least , he endeavored to arise .
" fast ! "
he muttered , and tore his jacket away from under the rock .
then he turned about , trying to locate his torch .
but that was missing , and all was dark around him .
" i 'm in a pickle now , " he thought .
" i wish i had taken old <unk> advice and remained around the camp-fire .
but who would have imagined that big rock would play a fellow such a trick ?
how in the world am i to get back again ? "
from a great distance he could hear darry shouting to him .
he tried to answer his cousin , but whether or not his voice was heard he could not tell .
with his hands before him , he moved around , and scarcely had he taken a dozen steps when he slid down a <name> incline .
here there was water ; and he shivered , thinking he might be dropping into an underground stream from which there would be no escape .
but when a pool was gained it proved to be but several inches deep .
as <name> stood in the pool there came a sudden rumble of thunder to his ears .
he listened , and by the sounds became convinced that an opening into the outer air could not be a great way off .
then came an unexpected flash of reflected light on the rocks by his side .
" hurrah , that light came from outside ! "
he cried .
" i 'm not buried alive , after all .
but i may be a good way from daylight yet . "
he had some matches in his box , and lighting one of these he discovered a passageway below him , running off to his left .
further on he picked up a bit of dry wood and lit this .
it made rather a poor torch , but proved better than nothing .
" now to get out , and then to find my way back to where i left old benson , " was his mental resolve .
with extreme caution he stole forward to where the lightning revealed a distant opening .
he did not leave one foothold until he was sure of the next , for he had no <name> to experiment with another moving rock .
the thunder now reached his ears plainly , and the lightning at times made the front of the cave as bright as day .
" it 's quite another place , " was his thought .
" that dangerous passage connects the two . "
suddenly , as <name> was advancing , he heard a clatter of horses ' hoofs , and into the cave ahead rode three rough-looking men , all armed with rifles and pistols and each carrying small saddle-bags across his steed .
at first <name> thought to call out to the newcomers , but he checked himself , for their appearance was decidedly against them .
" i 'll try to find out something about them first , " he muttered .
" perhaps they belong to that gang of bad men benson was telling us about yesterday . "
and then , as the three came to a halt in the center of the outer cave and dismounted , he crept closer , in the shadow of some sharp rocks , to overhear what they might have to say .
chapter iii .
an important conversation .
" who ever saw such a downpour before ? "
growled one of the three men , as he switched the water from his soft felt hat .
" i 'm wet to the skin . "
" i 'm no better off , " replied one of the others .
" i think we were fools to leave macklin 's place , gilroy . "
" just what i think , fetter , " said the third man .
" we could have waited as well as not . "
" yes , we could have waited , potts , " answered <name> gilroy ; " but , to tell the truth , i do n't want to trust macklin too far .
he might play us foul . "
" he would n't dare to do that , " returned <name> fetter .
" why not  if he thought he would get a reward ? "
came from nat potts , the youngest of the trio .
" one thing is certain , macklin is crazy to make money . "
" i know a thing or two of macklin 's past  that 's why , " went on <name> fetter .
" if he got us into trouble i would n't keep silent about him , and he knows it . "
" macklin is slippery , no two ways about it , " said <name> gilroy , as he took off his jacket and wrung the water out .
" i am not inclined to trust him , and that is all there is to it . "
" did he ever belong to the old gang ? "
questioned nat potts .
" some say he did , and some say he did n't . "
" he was a <unk> , that 's all , " came from <name> gilroy .
" he was always afraid to take the chances of being shot , but was on hand when the spoils were divided .
they used him as a messenger and a spy , but i don't believe he ever really helped to hold up a coach . "
" humph , then it 's a wonder the old crowd had anything to do with him ! "
" oh , they had to have messengers and spies , and they never gave macklin more than was coming to him , you can bet on that !
i understand that when the <unk> coach was held up six years ago , and the gang got twenty-two thousand dollars , they gave macklin five hundred , and he was glad to get that . "
" that was a big haul ! "
cried nat potts enthusiastically .
" i wish i had been in it . "
" the gang was followed for two days  by the soldiers under colonel fairfield , " went on <name> gilroy , as he threw himself on the rocks , leaving his companions to start up a fire .
" they had a hot time of it over to bear pass , i can tell you .
two men were shot , and one of them , <name> <unk> , my old chum , died from his wounds .
they say colonel fairfield himself fired the shot that took poor <unk> in the head , and if that 's so  well , i 've got an account to square with the colonel , that 's all . "
" you can square that after we 've had our little interview with the quartermaster , " returned <name> fetter with a hard laugh .
" that 's right  we 'll be sure to have the soldiers after us , " put in nat potts .
" they 'll be doubly mad when they learn that the <unk> resulted in the emptying of the box with their wages . "
" it <name> be a good haul if it goes through , boys .
the quartermaster <name> be carrying not less than twelve thousand dollars of the <unk> money besides his other stuff , " returned <name> gilroy .
here the conversation came to a temporary end , for nat potts had produced a black flask , from which each of the men took a deep draught .
then potts and fetter started in to build a roaring fire at which all might dry their clothing , leaving gilroy , the leader of the crowd , to do as he pleased .
<name> had listened to the talk with mingled interest and horror .
it did not take him long to realize the truth  that these men were thoroughly bad , and that they had been mixed up in road robberies of the past and were contemplating another robbery some time in the future .
" they mean to <name> the quartermaster of the fort , when he is bringing in the soldiers ' wages from <unk> , " he thought .
" and that leader is going to shoot down the colonel if he can .
who would imagine men could be so bad !
and that leader seems to be educated , too ! "
<name> would have been very much surprised had he known the truth , which was that <name> gilroy , often called the shadow , was a <unk> man , having passed through one of the leading <unk> of learning of the pacific coast .
but , following this college career , gilroy had forged checks and committed a burglary , in company with an old chum named <unk> , and then the two had left sacramento " between two days . "
<unk> had immediately joined the " knights of the road " and been shot down , as previously mentioned .
gilroy had drifted first to the mississippi and then to <name> , and had not gone into the mountains until later .
now he was at the head of a desperate gang , numbering ten or a dozen , who had already committed several " <unk> " of importance .
soon the fire was burning brightly , and the three men took off part of their wearing apparel , that the articles might dry .
they had brought some food with them , and as they sat eating and drinking they continued to discuss their plans .
nat potts , who was not over nineteen or twenty , was evidently something of a new member , and asked many questions regarding the organization , and as he took in what was told him , so did <name> , listening with " all ears , " as the saying goes .
" they must be as bad a crowd as can be found anywhere , " thought the youth .
" i wonder what they would do with me , if they found out i had been listening to their talk ?
perhaps they 'd kill me on the spot . "
and he gave a shiver .
the thunder and lightning had gradually abated , but with the coming of night the rain continued as steadily as ever .
fortunately for the desperadoes , however , the rocks sloped away from the entrance to the cave , so that no water came inside , while the fire made everybody quite comfortable .
hardly knowing what to do , <name> continued behind the rocks , taking care to remain in the shadow .
more than once he was afraid one or another of the men would start to investigate the surroundings and that he would be discovered .
" i wish they would go to sleep , " he said to himself .
" then i might get a chance to slip past them and their horses . "
with great impatience he watched the men finish up their supper , get out their pipes , and fall to smoking .
in the meantime the horses had been led to the opposite side of the cave and fastened to the rocks .
as <name> waited for a chance to get away he wondered what darry and old benson were doing .
more than likely they were looking for him .
but were they in that other cave , at the narrow passageway , or did the old scout know of this second cave and the secret entrance to it ?
" if benson leads the way around to here there may be trouble , " he mused .
" it would be better if i could get out and head him off .
but if i do get out , how shall i turn to find the trail we were pursuing ?
in this darkness a fellow could n't see his hand before his face . "
at last fetter threw himself down on a blanket to rest , leaving gilroy and potts still conversing earnestly by the fire .
the two desperadoes talked in a low tone , so that <name> now caught but little of what was said .
the backs of both men were turned toward the side of the cave where <name> was in hiding ; and , plucking up courage , the youth started forward on tiptoe , bent upon getting out of the cave before the men should make some move which would expose him .
step by step he advanced , until he reached a point where he was within a dozen feet of gilroy and almost as close to potts .
he hardly dared to breathe , and his heart thumped madly beneath his jacket .
but the men continued to smoke and talk , unconscious of his proximity .
at the entrance to the cave the rocks were somewhat rough and the mist had made them slippery .
<name> was crawling forward rapidly , when one foot slipped , and he pitched headlong , making considerable noise .
" what was that ? "
cried <name> gilroy , and leaped to his feet .
he had been gazing into the fire , and for the moment could make out little in the darkness .
" i do n't know , " returned nat potts .
" something moving around out there , i think . "
and the younger man reached for his pistol , which still remained in his belt .
as rapidly as he could <name> sprang to his feet .
a good bit of his wind had been knocked out of him , but he felt that he must not delay , and he ran for the outer air gasping for breath .
" hi !
stop ! "
roared <name> gilroy , catching sight of him at last .
" stop , i tell you ! "
" a boy ! "
ejaculated nat potts .
" he must have been hiding in here ! "
" if he was he overheard too much , " growled gilroy .
" come , we must catch him by all means , " and he ran after <name> , with potts following .
chapter iv .
lost in the forest .
" i must get away from them ! "
this was the one thought which surged through <name> moore 's <name> as he dashed from the cave in the mountain .
he felt that if he was captured it would go hard with him .
did the desperadoes learn that he had overheard their conversation , they might make his very life pay the forfeit .
forward he pitched , into the rain and the inky darkness , not knowing in what direction and just then caring but little .
his one idea was to put distance between himself and his pursuers .
" stop ! "
he heard the men call , and heard the clicking of a pistol hammer .
then he reached some brushwood , and , crouching low , continued to move on .
no shot came , for the reason that the desperadoes could not locate him with certainty .
at length <name> reached a clump of trees .
had he not had his hands before him he might have run into them head first .
he glided around them , and then continued onward , down a slope leading into a broad belt of timber .
still with his hands before him , he advanced through the undergrowth and between the stately trees for a distance of several hundred feet .
he was now exhausted with running and with fighting the <unk> vines , and had to halt to catch his breath .
as he came to a stop he listened attentively , to learn if the men were following , but the downpour of rain drowned out every other sound .
soaked to the skin , hatless , and still short of breath , he went on once more , feeling that he was not yet far enough from the cave for safety .
he tried to steer a course in the direction of the cave where he had left darry and the old scout , but whether he was successful or not he could not tell .
a hundred yards further and <name> came to another slope , covered with prairie grass .
down this he rolled in the darkness , to bring up in more brush below .
then he climbed out of the hollow at the opposite side , and , reaching a large fallen tree , sat down to rest and think over his situation .
the tree lay partly under one with <unk> branches , so the boy was somewhat sheltered from the storm .
it must be confessed that <name> 's heart sank within him as he reviewed the situation .
where he was he could not tell , nor could he form any definite plan for <unk> his cousin and old benson .
more than this , he was afraid that the desperadoes might come up at any minute and pounce upon him .
but as the minutes slipped by , and he neither saw nor heard anything of those in pursuit , he grew easier .
evidently they had given up the <name> .
" i <name> they have , " was what he thought .
" i never want to get so close to them again .
they are a hard crowd , if ever there was one .
if i can get to the fort and tell colonel fairfield of what i 've heard , i 'll be doing a good thing . "
an hour went by slowly , and then <name> looked around to find some means of making himself comfortable for the balance of the night , knowing it would be useless to pursue his course through the forest in the darkness .
" this is camping out with a vengeance ! "
he muttered grimly .
" darry ought to be along ; i guess he 'd soon get enough of it .
i 'll be lucky if i do n't fall in with some savage animal . "
the thought of wild beasts gave him another shiver , and he concluded to climb into a nearby tree , which was <unk> and had a spot where several branches made a sort of platform .
he was soon up in a comparatively dry place , and here he fell asleep , being too tired to hold his eyes open longer .
when <name> awoke the storm had cleared away and the sun was struggling through the scattering clouds .
the forest still dripped with the rain , and with this dripping were mingled the songs of the birds and the hum of insects .
stiff from the wet , he climbed slowly to the ground and looked around .
on every side were the tall trees and the dense undergrowth , shutting off the distant view of everything but a towering mountain to the westward .
this was the mountain he and the others had been ascending when the storm had overtaken them .
" i suppose i may as well head in that direction , " he mused .
" if i can strike the trail that <name> be something .
but i 'll have to keep my eyes open , or i may fall into the hands of that gilroy gang . "
he was hungry , but there were no means at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of his stomach , and so he had to move forward without eating .
getting into the forest had been difficult , but getting out was even more of a task .
the underbrush at certain points was positively impassable , and he had to make long <unk> , which took time and tired him greatly .
at noon he was still in the forest , and the mountain seemed as far off as ever .
" i am lost , that is all there is to it ! "
he burst out with a groan .
" i am lost , and perhaps i 'll never get out ! "
the sun shone down directly on his head , and even though still wet he was glad enough to seek the shelter the stately trees afforded .
here and there he saw some berries of various hues , but they were strange to him , and he did not dare touch them for fear of being poisoned .
toward the middle of the afternoon he reached a <name> <name> , flowing between the rocks , and here he again rested .
he reached the conclusion that the <name> came down from the mountain side and by following it up he must sooner or later run across the lost trail .
" i 'll follow it , anyway , " he told himself , and , hungry and footsore , set out along the water-course .
here the walking was somewhat better , for he had no brushwood and vines to tear aside .
the <name> was clear , and he often saw trout and other fish darting hither and thither .
this gave him an idea , and , picking some berries he had seen , he dropped them in .
at once some of the fish darted forward and swallowed the berries .
" hurrah , a good bait ! "
he cried , and quickly made himself a line out of threads from his clothing .
to this he attached a pin bent into shape with infinite care .
then he baited with the berries , and dropped the line in over a rock near a cottonwood .
hardly had his bait touched the water when a good-sized fish seized it , and in a twinkling he had his catch landed .
his heart gave a bound , for here was the material for at least one square meal .
" i 'll cook it right away , " he told himself , after feeling to see if he had any matches .
his hunger was beginning to make him desperate , and he did not much care even if the desperadoes did see his camp-fire .
with some trouble he got together a few sticks of wood and some moss which the <name> had dried out , and soon he had a respectable blaze between two rocks .
with his <unk> he cleaned the fish as best he could , and then broiled it on a green twig .
when done the meat was slightly burnt on one side and <unk> on the other , but to the <unk> lad nothing had ever tasted sweeter , and he continued to eat until the whole fish was gone .
" now i feel like myself , " he muttered , after washing down the repast with a drink from the <name> .
" on a pinch that meal ought to last me until to-morrow noon , and surely i ought to find my way back to the others by that time . "
with renewed energy he continued his tramp along the <name> , often wading in the water when the brushwood on either side was extra thick .
he kept his eyes and ears on the alert , but no human being came into sight , and presently a great feeling of loneliness swept over him .
" i 'm alone , " he whispered to himself .
" alone !
i must say i do n't like it much , " and he hurried on faster than ever .
the sun was shining over the distant mountain when he reached a bend in the <name> and came out upon a <name> trail which crossed the water-course at a right <name> .
as he looked at the trail he was tempted to shout with <name> .
" the place we crossed yesterday morning ! "
he exclaimed .
" there is the very spot where we got a drink and watered the horses .
now i ought not to have such a hard time finding the cave . "
he got down and examined the trail closely , hoping to discover some <unk> .
but the heavy rain had washed everything clean .
nevertheless , he felt certain that he was right , and hurried along as fast as his tired limbs permitted .
leaving the <name> , the trail wound in and out along a series of rocks and then through some heavy brushwood and along the edge of a jagged <name> .
the <name> was overgrown with heavy vines , which <name> down and brushed <name> 's head as he passed .
" i ca n't be more than three or four miles from the cave , " thought the boy .
" and if i hurry   " he stopped short , and then gave a cry of terror , and with good reason .
he had seen the vines ahead suddenly part , and now there came to view the shaggy head of a black bear .
as soon as the beast caught sight of the boy he leaped to the trail and advanced upon him .
chapter v. the big black bear .
<name> had never before met a black bear in the open air , but he had seen several in menageries and studied them at a safe distance , and he realized that he was in a perilous position .
the bear looked both <unk> and fierce and as if nothing would suit him better than to hug the lad to death and eat him up afterward .
<name> did not stand upon the order of his going , but went instantly , running as fast as his tired limbs would permit .
after him came the bear , and it was astonishing what good time the beast could make considering his size and his general appearance of <unk> .
looking over his shoulder , the lad soon saw that the beast was slowly but surely lessening the distance between them .
" shoo ! "
he yelled , and waved his arm threateningly , but the bear did not mind in the least .
he trotted on until less than two rods separated boy and beast .
then <name> reached some underbrush and rocks , with a <unk> tree in their midst , and without stopping to think twice he climbed into the tree and to one of the upper branches .
hardly had he reached what he thought might prove a temporary place of safety when he realized his mistake .
the bear came up the tree after him ,  slowly , it is true ; but still up ,  and this caused <name> 's hair to fairly stand upon end .
" i 'm a gone one now ! "
he groaned , and then espied another tree growing not far away .
a limb could just be reached , and as the bear almost gained the boy 's foot <name> swung himself from the first tree into the second .
as the lad gained a safe spot on the tree limb , the bear , coming to a halt on the branch opposite , set up a growl of rage and disappointment .
for a minute he surveyed the situation , then came out on the branch slowly , testing it inch by inch .
as it bent down he retreated , letting out a second growl , louder than the other .
<name> was wondering if he could drop to the ground and escape in that manner , when he saw the bear descend and come quickly toward the tree he was on .
he watched the beast closely , and waited until it was close to him .
then he made a leap back into the tree from which he had originally come .
again the bear came out as far as possible on a limb , and again he let out a growl of rage and disappointment .
in one way the situation was comical , and <name> might have laughed had he not felt so serious .
" we can keep this up a long time , i reckon , " thought the boy .
" and as long as you do n't try to leap after me i 'll be safe . "
finding he could not reach the boy by coming up one tree or the other , the black bear descended slowly to the ground .
then he walked around both trees several times , and at last came to a halt between the two .
here he sank down , as if to rest , but nevertheless kept one eye open and fixed upon <name> .
" he 's going on guard !
he means to keep me <unk> ! "
muttered the boy , and again his heart sank .
he remembered a story he had once read , in which a bear had starved a man to death and eaten him afterward .
would mr. bruin do so in this case ?
he wished he had a pistol , or a hunting-knife , or even a fair-sized stone .
but he had nothing except a thin club , which he had cut for himself with his <unk> .
this he kept in hand , and also kept the knife open and where he could get at it readily if needed .
half an hour went by ,  a time that to <name> seemed a whole day ,  and still the black bear remained between the two trees , dozing with one eye and watching with the other .
the sight of the beast taking it so easy was maddening under the circumstances , and at last the youth cut another club and hurled it down on top of the bear .
at once the beast flew up with a roar , and , standing on his hind legs , snapped his teeth at <name> .
then he flew up the tree once more , faster than ever before .
as the bear came up , <name> went higher than before , having seen another friendly limb over his head .
he was sorely tempted to reach for the beast with his club , but thought best not to run too much of a risk .
as before , the youth swung to the next tree , and again the bear gave a growl and went down .
then , being near the top of the tree , the lad took a good look around .
in a moment a sight caught his eye which caused his heart to jump with delight .
there on the trail were darry and old benson , riding along slowly .
" hi !
hi !
this way ! "
he shouted , with all the strength of his lungs .
" this way , darry !
this way , benson ! "
he saw his cousin and the guide bring their steeds to a halt and gaze around in wonder .
to them the voice appeared to come out of the very air itself .
" it 's <name> 's voice ! "
exclaimed darry .
" but i must say i do n't see him . "
both gazed around , and at last the scout caught sight of the boy's handkerchief fluttering among the tree branches .
" there he is ! "
he exclaimed .
" but what 's he doing up there ? "
" this way ! "
went on <name> , and as they turned in the direction , he added , " look out for the bear ! "
" a bear ! "
came from darry .
" he must be <unk> ! "
" i reckon you 've struck it , " muttered benson , and hastily unslung his rifle , at which darry did the same .
" follow me , but be on your guard , " went on the old scout .
he advanced with caution , his horse lifting his ears sharply as the neighborhood of the trees was gained .
presently the animal came to a sudden halt .
at the same moment benson caught sight of the bear .
" so that 's where ye are ! "
muttered the old scout .
the bear raised himself on his hind legs and let out a growl at the newcomers .
hardly had the sound arose upon the air when benson 's rifle cracked , and a bullet hit the beast in the breast .
down went the animal on all fours , but did not tumble further .
instead , he made a swift bound for the scout 's horse .
crack !
it was now darry 's rifle that spoke up , and the bear was hit again , this time in the right front knee .
he dropped , but quickly arose , shaking the wounded leg in the air and uttering a tremendous roar of pain and rage .
[ illustration : " now darry 's rifle spoke up , and the bear was hit again " ] neither horse would now stand still , and both danced around so lively that each rider had all he could do to keep his saddle .
but even while his steed pranced in this fashion , old benson managed to draw his pistol , and two additional shots rang out , both hitting the bear in the side .
the roars of the beast were now incessant , and the horses threatened to bolt in spite of all the riders could do to stop them .
" come ! "
cried the old scout , and turned from the scene .
thinking he meant to go off to reload , darry followed .
but when at a safe distance benson sprang to the ground and tied his horse to a tree .
" i 'd rather finish him afoot , " explained the old <name> , and slipped another cartridge into his rifle .
" you can stay here if you wish . "
" not much ! "
murmured darry , and came down also .
in a minute he was following the old scout .
when they came up a second time they found the bear crawling around , roaring in a lower tone .
evidently he was more than half exhausted .
" another good shot <name> finish him , " sang out <name> , from a bottom limb of the tree .
" why do n't you give it to him in the ear ? "
" i <name> , " answered the old scout , and circled around , watching his opportunity .
at length it came  the rifle cracked sharply , and bruin fell on his side , to rise no more .
" hurrah !
that 's a big haul ! "
cried darry , much delighted .
" i was wishing we 'd get a bear some time while we were out here . "
" it 's lucky the bear did n't get <name> , " remarked benson .
" they generally come up a tree after their victim . "
" i jumped from one tree to the other , " answered the youth .
" but i had quite an exciting time , i can assure you . "
" how in the world did you get here ? "
questioned darry , as <name> leaped to the ground .
" did you get through to another cave ?
benson thought that might be the case . "
" that was the case , darry .
and i 've had a wonderful adventure , too , " added <name> earnestly .
then he told his story , to which the others listened with close attention .
when he came to mention gilroy , fetter , and potts , old benson uttered a low whistle .
" so that gang has turned up again , eh ? "
muttered the old scout .
" this <name> be news to colonel fairfield .
i reckon he 'll be glad to be put on guard .
if the quartermaster was held up it would prove a big loss . "
" is it true that colonel fairfield killed this gilroy 's chum ? "
" perhaps he did .
the colonel was in that mix-up , and after it was over <name> <unk> was found dead in the bushes .
but it was a fair fight , and the desperadoes knew what to expect when they went in for it . "
" when does the quartermaster expect to come through with the money ? "
" i do n't know , <name> .
like as not it <name> be soon .
and that being the case , we had better not lose time here , but get to the fort just as soon as we can , " concluded the old scout .
chapter <name> .
darry makes a discovery .
as pressed as they were for time , darry and <name> begged that the <unk> be saved , and did all they could toward helping the old scout skin the beast .
with the pelt they took along about twenty pounds of the <unk> steaks .
" it 's a pity to leave the rest to the wolves ! "
sighed <name> .
" but it can't be helped .
what a feast they <name> have ! "
" i 'm going to sling the beast into a tree , " replied old benson .
" that may help save it until somebody else comes this way .
the soldiers from the fort use the trail yonder , you know . "
soon they were on the way to where benson and darry had left <unk> horse .
as <name> was tired from his night 's adventure , his cousin and the old scout took turns in carrying him behind them .
even then his eyes would occasionally close .
" we ca n't make the fort to-night , that 's certain , " said the old scout .
" not if we pushed on hard ? "
asked darry .
" <name> ca n't push on as fast as that , darry .
he 'll want to rest as soon as sundown comes . "
" perhaps i can get a nap at noon , while you two get dinner ready , " suggested <name> .
" i wonder if we 'll meet those rascals anywhere on the road ?
i <name> not , for they 'd be certain to recognize me . "
" we 'll keep an eye open for 'em , " responded benson dryly .
" and see to it that your <unk> are ready for use . "
" why  do you think they 'd attack us ? "
asked darry quickly .
" they might  if they thought we were carrying anything of value .
to such desperadoes all are fish that swim near their net . "
" it 's a pity the government ca n't stamp such a gang out , benson . "
" the government has stamped out lots of 'em , lad .
why , ten years ago none of these trails was safe .
nearly every horseman and stage-coach was held up .
to-day you do n't hear of a <unk> once in six months . "
" is this gilroy a very bad man ? "
" he is  in a way .
he 's a well-educated fellow , so i 've been told , and not as brutal as some .
but he 's committed some robberies that have no equal in the history of these parts .
once he painted himself as an indian and went to the agency , and there collected a lot of money which was coming to the redskins , the agent taking him for chief <unk> of the <unk> .
the trick was n't discovered until three days later , when the real <unk> turned up .
even then it was n't known who did the trick . "
" and how was gilroy found out ? "
" a fellow named <unk> , who belonged to the gang , was captured , and he gave the secret away .
but it cost <unk> his life , for he got away from the soldiers , and while he was in the mountains some of his gang shot and killed him . "
at this story both <name> and darry shuddered .
" what a lawless set ! "
muttered <name> .
" one could hardly believe it unless he saw it with his own eyes . "
" in a rough country the men are bound to be more or less rough , lad .
look at california , for instance .
to-day it 's as quiet and orderly as massachusetts or illinois .
but in the days of <unk> it was n't that way .
many a miner was held up for his gold dust , and many a miner 's secret of a <name> find was stolen from him and the miner himself murdered . "
" and how long do you think it <name> take to make this territory perfectly safe ? "
" there aint no telling about that , but probably when you are as old as i am now you 'll be able to travel anywhere without fear of being stopped .
the railroads are a-coming in , towns are building up , and one of these days the desperadoes and stage-coach robbers <name> all be a thing of the past  and a good job done . "
the third horse had been found , and now <name> was riding in his own saddle .
the rain of the night before had made the trail <unk> , and the air was as pure and sweet as one could wish .
by noon they calculated that they had covered ten miles of the worst portion of the distance to the fort .
the ride had been a strain to <name> , and when old benson called a halt he was glad enough to slip to the ground and throw himself in the shade of a tree to rest .
darry and the old scout lit a fire , and soon had a nice steak preparing for dinner .
" he 's asleep , " said darry , a little later , pointing to <name> .
" poor fellow !
supposing we let him rest for a couple of hours ?
i have n't the heart to wake him up . "
" all right , " answered benson .
the pair ate their dinner without arousing <name> , and after it was over the scout sat down near at hand to smoke his stumpy <unk> pipe , filling it with <unk> which was as black as coal , and puffing away with keen satisfaction .
darry was more restless , and having put away the things used in preparing the meal he began an inspection of the neighborhood .
" be careful , " said old benson , as the youth moved around .
" do n't get into trouble , as <name> did . "
" i 'll keep my eyes open , " replied darry .
opposite the trail was a tall spur of rocks with something of a series of natural steps leading to the top .
up these steps went the youth .
some of the climbing was difficult , but this he did not mind .
when the top was gained a magnificent panorama was spread out before him .
to one side were the tall mountains , hidden in a bluish mist , to the other the vast forests and plains .
northward was the continuation of the gap they were traveling , and southward was a series of foothills , with here and there a stream or waterfall glinting brightly in the <name> .
" how grand ! "
he murmured .
" what a vast country this is !
thousands upon thousands of people could live here , and nobody be crowded .
this would make splendid pasture for cows and sheep , and yet there is n't a single animal in sight . "
beyond the <name> spur was a similar elevation , and presently darry crossed to this .
here there was a lone pine with several low branches , and he <name> himself up and climbed to the top .
he could now see much further than formerly , and his view took in a portion of the trail passed several hours before , as it wound , <unk> , between the foothills .
" hullo ! "
he cried , as he caught sight of something moving on the trail .
" three people on horseback .
can they be the desperadoes <name> met ? "
he watched the riders with interest , and at last felt certain they were three men fully armed and wearing slouch hats and <unk> coats .
this description <unk> with that given by his cousin , and he hastened down to acquaint old benson with the news .
" must be the gang , " said the scout .
" are they moving this way ? "
" yes . "
" then we had better move on . "
<name> was awakened , and leaped to his feet , looking rather bewildered .
" i  i thought i 'd take a little nap , " he stammered .
" i suppose i've slept a good while , have n't i ? "
" about an hour and a half , " answered his cousin .
" here 's your dinner , " and he passed it over .
" we 've got to move on .
those rascals are behind us . "
" behind us ! "
" do n't get scared , " put in old benson .
" they are a good distance back .
darry discovered 'em from yonder p'int .
eat what you want , and then it <name> be time enough to start . "
the repast was quickly disposed of by <name> , and soon they were in the saddle once more .
the long nap had refreshed the lad greatly , and he said he would now be able to ride as far as anybody .
on they went , the trail growing more difficult as the top of the mountain was gained .
here there was a stiff breeze that at times was positively cold , and both boys were glad enough to button their jackets tightly around them .
if all went well benson calculated that they could reach <name> <unk> place with ease before dark .
this was the cabin of an old <name> and trapper who was known from one end of the territory to the other .
as mentioned at the beginning of this tale , leeson 's place was twenty miles from the fort .
" i could ride right through , " said the old scout .
" but you boys couldn't do it .
if you tried it , you 'd be so sore and stiff the next day you could n't stand up . "
chapter vii .
at <name> leeson 's cabin .
at first the boys were inclined to think that the old scout was mistaken  that they could ride as far as anybody .
but when , shortly after sunset , they came within sight of <name> leeson 's place both were glad to think that they would have to ride no more for the present .
" i 'm sore already , " whispered darry to his cousin .
" so am i  but i did n't want benson to know it , " was the low answer .
" that last mile of the trail was awfully rough . "
<name> leeson had seen them coming , and stood at the doorway of his cabin , rifle in hand .
he was a tall , thin man , with black eyes that were exceedingly sharp and shrewd .
when he recognized <name> benson he dropped his firearm into a corner and ran to meet the scout .
" downright glad ter see ye ! "
he said , shaking hands .
" <name> , <name> a sight fer sore eyes , thet 's wot ! "
" and i 'm glad to see you , <name> , " responded benson , just as warmly .
" how have things been with you ? "
" putty slow , to tell the truth . "
leeson looked at the boys .
" two <unk> along , i see . "
" yes .
this is <name> moore , brother to the captain up at the fort , and this is darry germain , his cousin .
boys , this is <name> leeson , the best trapper and <unk> shot in these parts . "
" oh , come , do n't be <unk> ' me so much ! "
cried leeson , as he took the boys ' hands in a grip that made them wince .
" as fer shootin ' , ye kin do thet yerself as good as anybody , <name> . "
he looked the boys over .
" glad to know ye , lads .
i know captain moore downright well , and he 's a good soldier . "
" i 've got news , <name> , " put in the old scout .
" <name> fell in with <name> gilroy 's gang down near <unk> run . "
" what ! "
roared the old trapper .
" do you mean to tell me thet measly crowd is around here ag'in ? "
" three of 'em are  gilroy , fetter , and a young fellow named potts .
i think potts comes from <name> . "
" i know him .
his father was <name> potts , the <unk> .
thet blood is about as bad as any in the gang .
what are they up to ? "
" they are laying a trap for the quartermaster when he comes through with the soldiers ' money .
<name> heard part of their talk by accident .
do you know when the quartermaster is expected ? "
" i do not .
ye see , ever since old cap'n <unk> was held up the army officers keep mum about the movements of the <unk> .
i reckon they have orders from washington to do it . "
" i want to warn colonel fairfield as soon as i can , " went on the old scout .
" yes , he ought to be warned . "
" can you lend me a fresh hoss ? "
" i can . "
" then i 'll be off as soon as i 've had a bit of supper .
the boys can stay with you all night , ca n't they ? "
" they can , an ' welcome , " replied <name> leeson .
" you are going to leave us ? "
queried <name> .
" do n't see any other way to do , lad .
the sooner i get the news to the fort the better .
i 'll come back in the morning after you  or send your brother or somebody else . "
" we can ride it alone , ca n't we ? "
questioned darry .
" i would n't try it , if i were you .
the trail is a rough one , and there are several forks where you might go astray . "
" better stay with me , lads , " put in leeson .
" i 'll treat ye well , never fear , " and he smiled broadly .
" thank you , " returned <name> .
" i was only thinking i 'd like to see my brother soon , that 's all . "
" a few hours more or less wo n't make much difference , " said darry .
he had looked around the trapper 's cabin , and was interested .
" let us wait . "
and so it was arranged .
it did not take long to get a bit of supper , and in less than half an hour <name> benson was off , astride of a powerful steed which had been <name> leeson 's pride for years .
" jest tell him to go to the fort , " said leeson , " and he 'll <name> ye thar with his eyes shet , " and he gave a parting salute to the old scout .
the cabin was a primitive affair of rough logs , with the chinks filled with dried <name> .
it contained two rooms , each about twelve feet square .
back of the cabin was a lean-to where leeson kept his horses , two in number .
there was room for more animals , so the beasts ridden by our friends were easily accommodated .
night had fallen by the time the horses had been rubbed down and fed and the boys had finished their evening repast , and it was dark when they gathered around the doorstep to rest .
<name> leeson sat on a <unk> , cleaning his rifle and smoking at the same time , and as the three rested <name> told of his adventure in the cave , and darry took up the tale of the bear .
" you had a lucky escape , lad , " said the trapper .
" a lucky escape , an ' no error .
like as not them desperadoes would have killed ye , had they caught ye . "
" i 've been thinking  do you imagine they 'll come here to-night ? "
asked darry .
<name> leeson shook his head .
" do n't allow as they <name> .
about a year ago i gave thet fetter fair warnin ' if he showed his face about my cabin i 'd plug him full o ' holes , an ' i sent gilroy the same message .
they know me , an ' know i wo n't stand any nonsense .
they 'll be likely to give me a wide berth .
they know i aint got much worth stealin ' . "
" then we ought to be safe until the soldiers get the news . "
" reckon you <name> be , lad , " answered the trapper .
he was very much of a quaint character , and for two hours the boys sat up , listening to his tales of encounters with wild animals , desperadoes , and indians .
" i 've had my own little fun with <unk> , " he said .
" got in a tree onct , and a b'ar kept me there fer a whole day .
i had wounded him in the leg , and in running over a <name> i dropped my gun . "
" how did you get away ? "
asked darry .
" i did n't know what to do fust .
the b'ar had me foul , and kept right at the bottom of the tree all the time .
with his wounded leg he couldn't come up , and i did n't dare to go down , and there we was  <unk> ' at each other , he <unk> ' and i <unk> ' all kind o ' unpleasant things about him . "
" did n't you have a pistol ? "
" no , all i had with me at the time was a <unk> , a <unk> , and my pocket-knife .
what to do i did n't know , and i was <unk> ' i 'd be starved out , when a thought struck me to blow him up with powder . "
" blow him up ! "
cried both boys .
" thet 's wot , lads  blow him up .
i had a handkerchief , ye see , an ' into this i dumped 'bout half my powder , an ' into the powder i put three matches , with the ends pointing out .
then i tied powder an ' matches into a hard lump and watched my chance .
there was a flat rock near the roots of the tree , and putty soon mr. b'ar squatted on this rock .
then i let drive fer the rock , an ' the powder an ' matches landed good an ' hard , i can tell ye . "
" and exploded ? "
put in <name> eagerly .
" yes , exploded with a noise ye could hear 'most a mile , i <unk> .
the powder flashed straight up into thet <unk> 's face , <unk> ' him and tearing his jaw half off , and the way he ran to save himself was a caution .
as soon as he was gone i dropped down and ran for my gun .
then i made after the b'ar and caught him between the rocks and finished him . "
this was the last story told that night , and soon after the tale was concluded leeson showed the boys into the inner room of the cabin , where there was something of a rough bed with a straw mattress .
" make <unk> ter hum , " he said .
" it aint no hotel , but it 's the best i 've got to offer ye . "
" but we do n't want to turn you out , " said darry .
" i 'll make myself comfortable near the door , " answered leeson .
" i want to sleep with one eye open  in case those rascals should take a notion to come this way . "
the boys were glad enough to rest indoors again and take off the clothing they had worn during the storm .
" camping out is well enough , " declared <name> ; " but i do n't want too much of it . "
" oh , we 've seen the worst side of it , " returned darry .
" i expect lots of good times when we get to the fort . "
" oh , so do i , for the matter of that . "
after turning in it did not take long for the cousins to get to sleep , and a little while later <name> leeson also threw himself down to rest .
but the old trapper remained close to the doorstep , and slept with his rifle near at hand .
an hour went by , and the darkness and silence continued .
there was no moon , and only a few stars were visible .
at a distance a few night birds were calling , and occasionally the howl of some lonely wolf could be heard , but that was all .
at last from out of the darkness of the trail came three men on foot .
they were <name> gilroy and his companions .
they had tethered their horses in the bushes some distance away .
they stole toward the cabin like so many grim and silent shadows .
chapter viii .
the stealing of the horses .
" go slow , men , " came softly from gilroy .
" you know what kind of a man leeson is . "
" reckon i do know , " came in a growl from fetter .
" and i 've got an account to settle with him , too . "
" i 'm pretty certain the boy is here , " went on the leader .
" but we must make sure if the others are here too , or if they have ridden off to the fort .
if they have gone to the fort   " " hist ! "
came in warning from potts .
" you 're talking too much .
i 've heard that this leeson sleeps with his ears wide open . "
" he does , " grumbled fetter ; and then the three desperadoes relapsed into silence .
they were advancing upon the cabin from the rear , and each held a ready pistol in his hand , while his rifle was slung over his back .
they had seen the boys and benson head for the trapper 's home while it was still light and they were on a high <name> ; but darkness had closed in on the scene , and they had come up to the spot in ignorance of what had followed .
tiptoeing their way they reached the lean-to where the horses had been <unk> , and with caution gilroy went inside .
by feeling the animals he soon learned that three had been in use but a few hours before , while the fourth was cool and comfortable .
" their horses are here , " he announced .
" and a fourth is here , too . "
" that 's leeson 's , " answered fetter .
" but i thought he had two or three . "
" might as well take them while we have the chance , " murmured potts .
" four <unk> <name> bring some money over at <unk> .
we can get <unk> to sell 'em . "
" let them out , " answered gilroy .
" without horses they 'll have their hands full trying to follow us . "
it was no easy task to untie the horses in a place that was pitch-dark , and it took some time to get even the horses belonging to our friends released .
as fetter and potts took the animals out , gilroy worked to untie the sturdy mare belonging to <name> leeson .
this was a pet animal , and not used to strangers .
as gilroy caught hold of the halter she gave a <unk> of suspicion .
" hush ! "
murmured the desperado , and ran his hand down the mare 's nose .
but this made her <unk> , and she stamped sharply half a dozen times .
" what 's up thar ? "
came in <name> leeson 's voice , and the trapper was wide awake on the instant .
" whoa , <name> , whoa ! "
" <name> the luck ! "
muttered gilroy , and ran outside after fetter and potts .
" he must have been on the watch . "
" we must get out ! "
responded fetter .
" he 's a <unk> , remember .
nothing but the darkness can save us . "
" i 'm going ! "
came from potts , and he leaped on the back of one of the horses  that which <name> had been riding .
" i 'm with you , " said fetter , and mounted old benson 's steed .
" come , <name> , and be quick about it . "
by this time <name> leeson was running around the corner of the cabin , gun in hand .
his call had aroused <name> and darry , and they were pulling on their clothing with all speed .
" something is wrong ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" it must be those desperadoes , " responded his cousin .
the boys were not yet dressed , when they heard a clatter of hoofs and a shot , followed by another .
then they came out , rifles in hand , to find leeson reloading near the stable .
" those desperadoes have been here ! "
exclaimed the old trapper .
" they ran off with your hosses , <unk> 'em ! "
" went off with the horses ? "
repeated darry .
" did you shoot at them ? "
" i did , but the light 's against me , and i do n't reckon as how i hit anything . "
<name> leeson meditated for a moment .
" i 've half a mind ter do it  yes , i have ! "
he muttered .
" do what ? "
asked <name> .
" go after 'em on my mare .
would you be afraid to stay here alone if i went ? "
" no ; go ahead ! "
cried both boys .
" we 'll keep watch while you are away , " continued <name> .
" if you can get the horses back it <name> be a great favor , " said darry .
" the three are worth over five hundred dollars . "
without further words , <name> leeson dashed into the stable , untied his mare and mounted her .
rifle over shoulder and pistol in hand , he dashed away on the back trail , whence the desperadoes had disappeared .
soon he was swallowed up in the darkness , although they heard the <unk> of <name> for several minutes after .
" this is the worst yet , " was <name> 's comment , when they were alone .
" those fellows are as daring as they are rascally .
i never dreamed they would come up in that fashion .
i wonder what they would have done if leeson had n't woke up ? "
" perhaps we would all have been murdered , " answered his cousin with a shudder .
" what shall we do , now we are dressed ? "
" that depends upon how long leeson remains away .
i move we remain on guard  one at the front of the cabin and the other at the rear .
if we keep our eyes peeled they ca n't come very close , even though it is dark . "
" all right , <name> .
keep your rifle handy . "
" do n't fear about that , darry . "
they were soon on guard , the one on the doorstep and the other near the lean-to , on a stump .
thus an hour dragged by .
to both it was an unusually long while .
" i do n't see a thing , " said darry , coming to where his cousin rested .
" nor i , and i 'm getting sleepy .
i hardly think leeson <name> be back until morning . "
" just what i was thinking .
let us take turns at watching .
the one on duty can walk around the cabin now and then , and that <name> give each of us some sleep . "
this was agreed upon , and they tossed up to see who should go on guard first .
it fell to darry 's lot , and <name> , hardly able to keep his eyes open , quickly retired , without undressing .
darry 's vigil was certainly a lonely one , doubly so because it was new to him .
as he tramped slowly around the cabin , he could not help but contrast this situation with the one he was used to at home .
" i do n't know as i 'd like to be a night policeman or a <unk> , " he reasoned .
" they must be awfully tiresome jobs .
and the city isn't near as lonely as this , either , even in the middle of the night . "
he <name> a long breath and looked at his watch .
" gracious , only three-quarters of an hour gone , and i 've got an hour and a quarter still to serve !
how awfully slow it is !
if leeson   what 's that ? "
he broke off short and came to a halt , with his rifle in his hands and his gaze fixed on some brushwood a hundred feet to the rear of the stable .
he had seen some dark object moving , but whether it was man or beast he could not tell .
" it was something , i 'm sure of that , " he told himself , after the object had disappeared from view .
" if it was a man he must have been crawling on hands and knees . "
he wondered if he had better awaken <name> , but hesitated , knowing how sleepy his cousin was .
perhaps the object would go away  if it was a wild beast .
keeping his eyes on the spot , darry waited what seemed to him a long time , but which was really but a few minutes .
then slowly the bushes parted and the object came forth , with eyes that gleamed fitfully even in that darkness .
" a mountain wolf ! "
muttered the boy .
" well , i 'm glad it is n't one of those desperadoes . "
taking up a stone he hurled it at the wolf , at the same time shouting to the beast to go away .
at once the wolf turned tail and disappeared whence it had come .
" did you call ? "
came sleepily from <name> .
" there 's a wolf in the bushes back of the cabin , " returned darry .
" does he want to attack you ? "
" i do n't know .
i just threw a stone at him , and he 's slunk out of sight . "
by this time <name> was also outside , and the two cousins waited for the reappearance of the wolf .
but the animal was cowardly , and did not show himself again , and presently <name> returned to bed .
the remainder of the night passed without anything unusual happening .
chapter ix .
arrival at the fort .
the morning found the two boys still alone .
the sun was well up over the eastern prairie before both were dressed , for they had taken turns at guarding , as agreed , and each had consequently lost half his regular sleeping time .
" well , what 's to do now ? "
questioned darry , while they were stirring around getting breakfast .
" i do n't know of anything to do but to wait here until we hear from benson and <name> leeson , " answered his cousin .
breakfast was soon disposed of , and then they sat down to wait , still keeping their firearms close to hand , in case of unexpected attack .
the meeting with the desperadoes had opened the boys ' eyes , and they did not intend to be caught " napping " no matter what else happened .
shortly before ten o'clock <name> espied three horsemen coming down the trail which led to the fort .
both watched the approaching riders with interest , and presently saw that they were soldiers .
one wore the uniform of a lieutenant , and the others were privates .
" you are from the fort ? "
cried <name> , running forward to meet them .
" yes , " was the answer from the lieutenant .
" which of you is <name> moore ? "
" i am . "
" i am glad to know you , moore .
your brother , the captain , and i are great friends .
i am lieutenant <name> <name> . "
" oh , i 've heard of you , " answered <name> , smiling .
" <name> has often mentioned his chum , <name> <name> , in his letters .
this is my cousin , darry germain .
did old benson reach the fort last night ? "
" he did , " answered lieutenant <name> , as he shook hands with both boys .
" and your brother and a detachment of company a have gone out to look for <name> gilroy and his gang .
benson went with them , and i was asked to come down here and escort you to the fort . "
" if my brother wants to round up gilroy 's gang he should have come here , " said <name> .
" the rascals were here last night and stole our three horses . "
" is it possible !
and where is <name> leeson ? "
" he went after them on his horse , the only one they did n't get .
we are looking for his return at any moment .
we promised to watch the cabin until he got back . "
" i see . "
the lieutenant turned to the privates .
" men , you may dismount and tie up the horses for the present .
we wo n't be going back just yet . "
lieutenant <name> leaped to the ground , and one of the privates took charge of his steed .
the young officer was a handsome fellow , with a smiling face , and both <name> and darry took to him at once .
" yes , captain moore and i are great friends , " he said .
" you see , we went through west point together , and we have been more or less together ever since .
he has often told me about you two fellows , so i feel as if i've known you for a long while . "
he looked at <name> .
" you must have had quite an adventure with those desperadoes at the cave . "
" i did have , " answered <name> .
" i <name> my brother and the others round them up .
do you know if they came anywhere near here ? "
" no , they struck off on another trail  the one the quartermaster is expected to use .
you see , he is to come in to-morrow with that money . "
" to-morrow !
then they 'll have time to warn him . "
" that depends upon circumstances .
the quartermaster is an odd sort of a fellow , and sometimes changes his mind about routes .
he may come in the way we expect , and he may take some entirely different trail . "
" we ca n't say when leeson <name> be back , " put in darry .
" but it seems to me it is our duty to stay here until he returns ; do n't you think so , <name> ? "
" i do , darry .
but he <name> probably be back before long . "
it was only a few minutes later when one of the privates came forward with the information that a man was coming through the underbrush skirting the timber .
it was <name> leeson , and he held his mare to a walk , for <name> was all but exhausted .
" mornin ' , lieutenant ! "
he called out , as he <name> closer and saluted .
" come for them boys , i reckon . "
" i did , leeson .
they tell me you 've been after the gang .
what luck ? "
<name> leeson shook his head dubiously .
" reckon i did n't have any luck , lieutenant .
got one shot , but if i hit it did n't count much .
they had the best o ' me in the timber , and they got away , not only with the hosses belonging to the boys an ' benson , but likewise with their own , which they had tethered in a hollow not far away . "
" then our horses are gone ! "
cried darry , his face falling .
" thet 's it , lad .
i 'm sorry , but i did my best . "
" oh , i do n't blame you , leeson .
but  but if we have n't any horses , how are we to get to the fort ? "
" we 'll take turns at carrying you , " replied lieutenant <name> .
<name> leeson was as worn out as his mare , and while one of the soldiers cared for <name> the old trapper sank down on his doorstep and told his story .
he had followed the desperadoes up hill and down for fifteen miles , and gotten one shot at fetter , which , he believed , had struck the rascal in the arm .
but the party had turned on the trail while passing through a wide patch of <unk> , and on coming out at the other side he had been unable to locate them again .
then , as it was almost morning , he had thought best to return to his cabin , to ascertain how the boys were faring .
" which road were they near when you saw them last ? "
asked lieutenant <name> .
" over at <unk> 's rock , " answered leeson .
" moving toward the knob . "
" humph !
then i am afraid captain moore wo n't round them up very quickly . "
" my brother did n't go near that trail ? "
questioned <name> .
" no , he 's on a trail three miles further north .
still , the desperadoes may turn north . "
" that 's so , " said leeson .
as there was nothing to keep them at the cabin , the boys were now anxious to move on to the fort , and a short while later lieutenant <name> set off .
one private carried <name> and the other darry ; and , as the horses were powerful beasts , good progress was made .
" hurrah !
the fort ! "
cried <name> , as he caught sight of a large flag waving in the distance .
he was right ; and soon they could see the tall stockade quite plainly .
it was three hundred feet long by two hundred feet wide , and surrounded by a ditch twelve feet deep .
inside of the stockade were the fort proper and a dozen other buildings , including the <unk> quarters , the men 's quarters , the <unk> , hospital , and the gymnasium , and also a good-sized stable .
" why , it 's a regular town in itself ! "
murmured darry , when they got inside .
" that 's right , a town of exactly two hundred and seventy-five people , " answered the lieutenant .
" and of that number two hundred and sixty are soldiers belonging to three companies , three are officers ' wives , two are indian scouts , and the rest are cooks and other helpers . "
colonel fairfield , a tall , dignified old officer , had been told of their approach , and now came from the officers ' quarters to meet them .
" i am glad to see you , boys , " he said , as he shook hands warmly .
" if the story benson told is true you have had quite a few adventures in reaching here .
i am sorry your brother is not here to meet you , <name> ; but he was anxious to go after the gilroy gang , and i let him have his way . "
" you have n't heard about all of our adventures , colonel , " said darry , and told of the stolen horses .
" worse and worse ! "
returned the colonel , stroking his mustache thoughtfully .
" that proves that the gang  or what is left of it  is as desperate as ever .
those fellows <name> never give up until they are either arrested or shot down . "
" i <name> my brother does n't get into trouble with them , " said <name> anxiously .
" well , a soldier has to take some risks , my boy .
but captain moore is as shrewd as he is brave , so you need not fear for his safety .
come right in ; mrs. fairfield <name> be glad to see you .
she wants to hear from all the folks at home . "
the boys followed the old officer into the quarters , and here received an equally warm greeting from mrs. fairfield , whom they had met in chicago .
dinner was soon served , and while the lads were satisfying the inner man they had to tell their whole story over again , and also tell all the news from home .
" while you are here , boys , you must make yourselves perfectly at ease , " said the colonel .
" i know your fathers <name> expect me to be a father to you .
as for captain moore , i <name> allow him to be with you as much as military discipline permits . "
chapter x .
the result of a swim .
to the boys , who had never visited a military quarters before , the fort proved of great interest , and they were glad , after the meal was over , to have lieutenant <name> take them around .
this occupied some time , and when they had finished it was time for the evening parade .
this was quite an affair , and the two lads joined the ladies of the place to witness it .
everybody turned out , in uniform as clean as possible , on inspection .
the drums rolled , the <unk> struck up a lively air , and the three companies , headed by a <name> , marched around the stockade several times and then to the parade-ground in front of the gates .
here the command went through the <name> of arms and through a number of fancy evolutions .
" it 's splendid ! "
murmured <name> .
" everything moves like clockwork . "
" it makes me almost wish to be a soldier , " answered darry .
" but if a fellow had this day in and day out i am afraid he would grow tired of it . "
" you are right , darry , " said mrs. fairfield .
" the colonel has to think up a great number of things whereby to interest his men .
they get up all sorts of contests , and <unk> and theatricals , and go hunting when they can get the chance  anything to keep them from growing too dull . "
" have they had any real military duty to do lately ? "
asked <name> .
" not for over a year .
then the <unk> indians got up a <unk> , and they had to march over to <unk> and stop it .
two indians were killed and one soldier was badly wounded .
since that time the indians have been quiet . "
" but the indians may rise again . "
" probably they <name>  one is never sure of them .
as one old general has said , 'the only safe indian is the dead indian . ' "
the boys were assigned to a small room next to that occupied by captain moore and lieutenant <name> .
the apartment was neatly furnished with iron cots , an iron washstand , and a small wardrobe for extra clothing .
fortunately the extra clothing they had carried had not been stolen , so they were not as bad off as they would otherwise have been .
<name> was anxious to hear from his brother <name> , but had to be patient .
yet he was not greatly worried , for he was almost certain that the soldiers would fail to fall in with the desperadoes , each having taken a different trail .
the day following their arrival the boys fell in with several soldiers who were going fishing up a mountain stream not far away , having obtained special leave of absence for that purpose .
the soldiers , who were named <unk> , ferry , and lambert , were glad enough to have the boys for company .
" we 'll show you some good sport , " said lambert , who proved to be something of a leader .
" no better fish in these parts than those you can catch in <name> pass river . "
the boys had no <unk> , but lieutenant <name> fitted them out , and soon the party was on the way .
the soldiers were to be gone but four hours , and so struck out at a gait that taxed <name> and darry to the utmost to keep up with them .
" it 's the air does it , " explained <unk> , when darry spoke about the speed .
" after you 've been out here a while you 'll eat like a horse and feel like walking ten miles every morning before breakfast .
i tell you , the air is wonderful . "
" it certainly is bracing , " answered darry .
" i noticed that as soon as we began to climb the foothills . "
a walk of half an hour brought them to <name> pass river , and they journeyed along the bank until they came to a favorite <unk> .
" here we are , " said lambert .
" now for the first fish ! "
" ten cents to whoever catches it ! "
cried <name> , and placed a shining dime on a nearby tree stump .
at this the three soldiers laughed .
" that dime is mine , " declared ferry , who was the first to throw in .
" perhaps , " answered <unk> .
" but i reckon i 've got just as good a chance now . "
" here i come , " put in lambert , and threw over his friends ' heads .
hardly had his bait gone down than he felt a tug and whipped in a little fish not over six inches long .
" mine ! "
he cried .
" it is n't worth ten cents ! "
cried <unk> and ferry ; nevertheless lambert pocketed the coin , amid a general laughing .
the boys now went to a spot a little above where the soldiers were fishing , and set to work on their own lines .
just as ferry announced a fine haul , they threw in , and soon everybody in the party was busy , bringing in several kinds of fish , big and little , including some fine trout of a variety the boys had not before seen .
inside of an hour everybody had all the fish he wanted , and then the soldiers said they were going to take a swim .
the boys were willing , and soon the whole crowd were in the water , calling out and laughing and having a good time generally .
" do n't go too far down the stream , " cautioned lambert .
" the falls are below , and you might get caught in the rapids . "
" all right , we 'll surely remember , " answered <name> .
" i 'll race you across the river and back , " said darry , a little later .
" done ! "
cried <name> .
" to what point ? "
" to that <name> hanging down near the big rock . "
so it was agreed , and in a minute both boys were off .
they were good swimmers , and the race interested the soldiers , so that they gave up sporting around to watch the result .
at this point the stream widened out to nearly two hundred feet , so the race was not a particularly short one .
the water ran quite swiftly , and they soon found they had to swim partly up stream to prevent being carried below the <name> .
darry made the <name> first , and , touching the <name> , started on the return .
<name> was close behind , and now it became a <unk> race between them .
" go it , boys ! "
shouted lambert .
" do your best ! "
" i bet on <name> , " said ferry .
" i bet on darry , " added <unk> .
hardly had the wager been made when <name> shot ahead .
slowly but surely he <name> away from his cousin .
while the sport was going on nobody had noticed a large tree that was drifting rapidly down the middle of the river .
now , however , lambert saw the danger .
" look out ! "
he cried wildly .
" look out !
a tree is coming down upon you ! "
<name> heard the cry , and looking up the stream managed to get out of the way of the big piece of driftwood .
but darry was not so fortunate , and in a twinkling the youth was struck and carried out of sight .
this accident came so quickly that for the moment nobody knew what to do .
" darry !
darry ! "
cried <name> .
" where are you ? "
" he went under ! "
shouted lambert .
" the tree branches struck him on the head . "
" he 'll be drowned ! "
gasped <unk> .
" what shall we do ? "
by this time the tree had drifted past the point where the soldiers were stationed .
<name> had now struck bottom with his feet , and at once went ashore .
" we must do something ! "
he panted .
" we ca n't let darry be drowned ! "
" he must be caught under the branches , " said lambert .
" as the tree hit him it turned partly over .
perhaps   there is his foot ! "
he pointed to the tree  and there , sure enough , was darry 's left foot , kicking wildly above the surface of the river .
then the boy 's head came up , but only for a moment .
" save me ! "
he spluttered , and immediately disappeared .
" this is awful ! "
groaned <name> .
" ca n't we throw a <unk> over the tree and haul it ashore ? "
" a good idea ! "
answered lambert .
" we 'll take two lines . "
he caught up the <unk> , and lines in hand ran along the river bank until he was below the tree .
the others followed , and helped him to get the lines into shape .
then a quick cast was made , but the lines fell short .
" too bad ! "
came from <name> .
" quick , try once more ! "
" the tree is turning over again ! "
shouted <unk> , and he was right .
as some other branches came into view , they beheld darry , caught in a crotch and held there as if in a <unk> .
another cast was made , and then a third , but all in vain .
then the tree , with its helpless victim , moved forward more rapidly than ever , in the direction of the roaring falls , which were but a short distance off .
chapter xi .
something about drilling .
" darry is lost !
nothing can save him now ! "
such was the agonizing thought which rushed through <name> 's <name> as he watched the progress of the drifting tree as it moved swiftly toward the falls of <name> pass river .
he knew the falls to be over thirty feet high .
at the bottom was a boiling pool which sent up a continual shower of spray .
nobody entering that pool could survive .
darry , too , realized his peril , and continued to call for help .
had he been able to loosen himself he would have leaped into the water , but he was weak and helpless , and his voice could scarcely be heard above the rushing of the rapids .
<name> and the three soldiers continued to run along the river bank , over rough rocks that cut their feet and through bushes which scratched them in scores of places .
at last they came out on a point directly above the falls .
the tree still spun on , and <name> closed his eyes to shut out the sight of what was to follow .
suddenly lambert let out a shout : " the tree is caught !
it has stopped moving ! "
again <name> looked , and he saw that what the soldier said was true .
the under branches of the drifting tree had hit some sharp rocks below the river 's surface , and one branch had wedged itself fast .
this catching of the driftwood bent down the limb that held darry , and soon they saw that the <unk> boy was free from the grip which had held him .
but what to do next the lad did not know .
to swim to the shore was out of the question .
" i  i ca n't make it , " he told himself , as he panted for breath .
he was so exhausted that he felt very much like fainting away .
but he knew he must keep his senses , or all would be over with him .
" darry !
darry !
are you much hurt ? "
called out <name> .
" not much , but i  i ca n't  swim  ashore ! "
was the gasped out answer .
" i 'll try the fishing lines again , " said lambert , and prepared them once more .
a first cast did not reach darry , but a second did , and he caught the <unk> to the lines with a good deal of satisfaction .
" <name> they hold ? "
questioned <name> .
" i <name> so , " answered lambert .
" anyway , it 's the best we can do . "
letting the lines run out as far as possible , the soldiers and <name> moved up the bank of the stream to where there was a series of rocks projecting into the water a distance of several yards .
" now brace me , and i <name> haul in , " said lambert .
then he called to darry to help them by swimming as well as he was able , with the lines caught around him , under the arms .
" all right , i 'm ready ! "
cried the boy , and dropped into the stream , taking care to steer clear of the tree .
lambert hauled in slowly but steadily .
the line straightened out and became taut , and looked as if it might snap at any instant .
<name> 's heart came up into his throat , and he breathed a silent prayer that his cousin might be saved .
" here he comes ! "
muttered lambert at length , and they could see that darry 's feet at last rested on the <name> bottom of the river .
they continued to haul in , and soon he was safe .
when on shore he pitched himself on the grass , completely exhausted .
" oh , how glad i am ! "
cried <name> , as he knelt beside his cousin .
" i was almost certain you 'd be drowned ! "
" it was a narrow escape ! "
answered dairy , when he could speak .
" when the tree first struck me i was almost stunned , and when i realized what had happened i found myself fast and hardly able to budge .
just look there ! "
and he showed a deep scratch on one side of his body and a heavy red <name> on the other .
" but never mind , " he went on .
" i am thankful my life was spared ! "
it was a <unk> party that dressed and journeyed back to the fort , <name> carrying both his own fish and those his cousin had caught .
" i am afraid that <name> end fishing and swimming for a while , " said <unk> .
" the soldiers never go near the falls , for they all know the danger , but colonel fairfield is too strict to run any chances . "
" do n't say anything about the adventure on the tree , " said darry .
" <name> you keep mum ? "
" i <name> , and so <name> you , wo n't you , <name> ? "
" yes . "
so it was arranged that nothing should be said , that the <unk> little recreation might not be interfered with , for both boys saw that they had little pleasure at the best .
" a fine haul for you boys ! "
said lieutenant <name> , as he surveyed the catch .
" i must go myself and try my luck .
i have n't been fishing this summer . "
" it 's a splendid place for bites , " said <name> .
" i know it .
but you have to be careful up there .
there 's a nasty fall in the river .
if you went over that you 'd never come out alive . "
" yes , we saw the fall , " answered darry , and gave a shudder in spite of himself .
again at sunset there was a parade , similar to that of the day before .
after it was over the boys procured guns and had lambert put them through their " paces , " as he called it .
" first we 'll drill a bit without guns , " said the old soldier , for lambert had seen sixteen years of service .
" toe this line , heads up , chest out , and little fingers on the seams of your trousers .
that 's all right .
now then , eyes right !
when i say that turn your eyes to the right , but do n't move your faces .
now , eyes front !
that 's good .
eyes left !
eyes front !
that 's first-rate . "
" but we 're not moving , " said darry .
" now we 'll move .
watch me .
right face !
do you see how it 's done ?
balance on the heel , this way , and swing around .
now then , right face ! "
the two boys came around like <unk> old soldiers .
" good , boys , good .
now then , front face !
good .
left face !
that 's not so well .
front face !
now here 's another , about face ! "
so the drilling went on , until the boys could move as lambert wished them to .
then they began to march and to wheel right and left .
at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces , and then showed them the <name> of arms .
[ illustration : " at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces . " ]
" you 'll learn in no time , " said the old soldier , when his off time came to an end .
" you 've crowded a dozen lessons into one . "
" and i feel it , " said darry .
" i 'm going in to rest . "
and he went , followed by <name> .
all told , the boys had enjoyed the drill very much .
<name> was somewhat worried when bedtime came and still nothing had been heard of his brother .
yet colonel fairfield told him not to mind the prolonged absence .
" but should not your quartermaster be here ? "
asked the boy .
" he may come in to-morrow morning , " answered the colonel .
the next day dawned cloudy , and by noon a steady rain was falling .
the boys hardly knew what to do , and , after watching a drill and some performances in the gymnasium , went back to the living quarters .
they had hardly entered when there came a shout from the guard at the stockade .
" captain moore is coming , with the quartermaster ! "
was the cry .
" hurrah , it 's <name> ! "
shouted <name> , and ran out despite the rain to welcome his brother .
soon the soldiers came up , <unk> and tired .
they embraced half of company a , and in their midst was the quartermaster of the regiment , with two attendants .
each of these three carried heavy saddle-bags , filled with government money for the soldiers , for <unk> was now due .
" <name> ! "
cried captain moore , as he dismounted and caught his brother by the hand .
" i am glad to see you safe and sound . "
" and i am glad to see you , " answered <name> .
" i <name> be with you soon  i must first report to colonel fairfield , " went on the young officer , and lost no time in seeking the commandant .
his story was soon told , and it speedily spread to all parts of the fort .
along with his men and old benson he had looked in vain for the gilroy gang for a whole day .
then he had come upon them just as they were preparing for an attack upon the quartermaster and his escort .
the gang had numbered eight , and in the fight which had followed two of the crowd had been wounded , although all had made their escape by swimming their steeds over a dangerous mountain torrent .
of the soldiers three had been wounded , one man quite seriously .
the young captain had received a bullet through his hat .
" it was <name> gilroy himself who fired that shot , " said captain moore .
" and i wo n't forget it when next we meet . "
old benson had been in the thickest of the fight from beginning to end , and it was he who had wounded one of the desperadoes while the fellow was in the act of carrying off one of the <unk> .
the rascals had fought hard over that <unk> , but in the end had been compelled to drop everything and ride to save their lives .
as soon as captain moore had made his report , another detachment was sent out , to follow the desperadoes , if they could be found .
this detachment was fifty strong and under the leadership of lieutenant <name> .
the lieutenant was a man who had met numerous desperadoes in his time , and it was felt that he could do the work much better than the average soldier .
chapter xii .
deer hunting .
with his brother at hand , <name> felt much more at home than formerly , and the captain 's presence also made a difference to his cousin .
old benson remained at the fort for the time being , and did what he could to please the boys .
he took an especial interest in their shooting , and would often set up a target on the prairie for them to practice on .
" you 'll do first-rate in a little while , " he said .
" and as lambert says you take to drilling , it wo n't be long afore you 're both out-and-out soldiers . "
" i do n't know as i care to be a regular soldier , " answered darry .
" i would n't mind it for a while , but to enlist for five years  why , that's another thing . "
" lambert has enlisted four times .
when his time is out he 'll be in service twenty years . "
" and yet he is only a private , " put in <name> .
" he is content , and does n't want to go any higher .
he likes the life , and he told me not long ago that he would n't know what to do with himself if he was out of uncle <name> 's employ . "
one day after another passed , until the boys had been at the fort a little over a week .
they now knew the drills and the " <unk> " as well as anybody , and often practiced on the apparatus in the gymnasium .
" it 's not so bad , after you once get used to it , " said <name> .
" the men are a good deal of company for each other . "
" it 's odd to see so many men and so few women , " returned darry .
" some of the men do n't want any women around , so i 've been told .
they are like some of the old-time miners who used to move out of camp as soon as a <unk> showed itself . "
one day captain moore and old benson got permission to go off on a hunt , and took the boys along .
all of the party were mounted , and each carried a <unk> with part of the necessary camping outfit .
" if it 's possible to do so , i 'll show you some big game , " announced the old scout .
" although i 'll allow big game is mighty scarce , even in these parts . "
" have the hunters shot down everything ? "
asked <name> .
" a good bit , lad .
you see , many used to come out here just to shoot for the sake of killing .
i 've known a party of six men to kill twenty or thirty buffalo and then leave the carcasses to the wolves .
that was a shame . "
" so it was ! "
cried darry .
" one or two buffalo would have been enough . "
" some hunters never know when to stop , " put in captain moore .
" they shoot as long as anything shows itself .
if it was n't for that these hills would be filled with buffalo , deer , bears , and all other kind of game . "
the morning was clear and cool , and everybody in the party was in the best of spirits .
the course was down into a broad valley , in the middle of which flowed the <name> pass river , and then up a series of hills leading to <name> long mountain  a favorite resort in this territory for sportsmen .
" do you think we 'll see or hear anything of those desperadoes ? "
asked <name> of his brother , as they rode along side by side .
" it 's not likely , " answered the young captain .
" as soon as they learn that the soldiers are after them they 'll take to their heels in double-quick order .
they have n't any taste for meeting our regulars . "
" it 's queer that this <name> gilroy should go in for this sort of life  if he is as well educated as you say . "
" some men do n't like anything better , <name>  they would n't earn their living honestly if they could .
it 's queer that this is so , but it 's a fact .
those men have no regular homes , although many often talk of settling down .
generally they die with their boots on , as the saying goes . "
by noon the party had covered fifteen miles and were well into the hills .
they came to a rest beside a fine spring which flowed from a split in the rocks .
near at hand was some dense brushwood , and old benson rightfully guessed that it would not be difficult to beat up some birds .
" you can now try your luck at aiming , " he said to the boys , and led the way into the dense growth .
soon a flock of birds arose directly before them , and both darry and <name> took a quick shot , bringing down seven of the quarry .
then the scout fired , and five other birds dropped .
" pretty good for a starter ! "
cried old benson , as they stalked around picking up the game .
" that target practice has made you both pretty steady .
just a round dozen , all told .
that 's <unk> for dinner , i reckon . "
captain moore was also pleased when told of what his brother and his cousin had accomplished .
" you 'll make great hunters in time , " he said .
" the main thing is to keep your nerve when big game <unk> you .
you know you have the best of a bird or squirrel , or anything like that .
but when it comes to a buffalo , or a bear   " " i know all about bears , " interrupted <name> , and at this there was a general laugh .
" if i ever meet another bear i want to be well prepared for him , " he continued .
" generally a wild animal wo n't fight , " went on the young captain .
" but when one is cornered he is apt to get very ugly ; eh , benson ? "
" right you are , captain .
i was once cornered by a buffalo , and had all i could do to save myself . "
the old scout calculated that they would strike some game that afternoon , and he was not mistaken .
about two o'clock they sighted several deer far up the hillside .
" fine , plump animals , " said benson .
" if we get a couple of them we can be well satisfied . "
it was decided that they should move around in a semicircle , so as to get to leeward of the herd .
" if we do n't do that , the deer <name> scent us and be off in no time , " explained captain moore .
their horses were tethered in the brush , near some trees , and the party of four started out on foot .
the way was rough , but the boys did not mind this .
their sole thought was upon the deer , and each resolved to bring down one of the game , no matter at what cost .
it was no light task to reach a spot from which to shoot .
they had to cross several depressions on the hillside , and here the undergrowth was so heavy that progress at times seemed impossible .
once darry went into a hole up to his waist , and came out with several rents in his coat , where the thorns had clung to him .
" oh ! "
he muttered .
" oh ! "
" are you hurt ? "
questioned <name> quickly .
" not much , but i reckon i 'm a good deal scratched up , " answered darry , with a wry face .
at last they gained a point well to leeward of the quarry , and benson brought the party to a halt .
" we 'll creep in as far as we can , " he said .
" but keep your guns ready for use , and as soon as one fires the others had best fire too , for the deer wo n't wait after one shot .
which <name> you take , captain ? "
" i 'll take the one near the big rock , " answered captain moore .
" <name> , you had better take the one on the knoll . "
" i <name> . "
" i 'll take the one rubbing his side with his <unk> , " put in darry .
" and i 'll take the one coming through the brush , " finished old benson .
" now then , forward .
make no noise , and be sure your gun does n't go off and hit somebody else instead of the deer . "
rifles in hand , they crept through the underbrush and down toward the glade in which the deer were feeding .
the animals did not become suspicious until they were less than a hundred yards away .
then , of a sudden , the leader threw up his head and began to sniff the air .
" now fire , " said benson in a low tone .
at once the four rifles came up , and each <name> took steady aim .
darry and <name> fired at the same instant , and the young captain and benson discharged their pieces immediately after .
the aim of the two older hunters was true , and two deer fell dead after going less than six steps .
but the other game was only wounded , <unk> deer in the side and darry 's in the flank , and they bounded away up the hillside .
" missed ! "
groaned <name> , and slipped another cartridge into his firearm .
darry did the same , and both fired a second time .
then , seeing how badly the deer were wounded , they ran after the animals .
the course of the deer was straight for the timber down the mountain-side , and through the brush crashed quarry and boys until another hundred yards were covered .
then , coming to a <name> <name> , and being unable to leap to the top , the deer came to a halt .
" do you see 'em ? "
panted darry , almost out of breath with running .
" yes  there they are ! "
returned <name> .
" see ? "
" i do .
they ca n't get up the rocks .
<name> , we 've got 'em after all .
we must shoot   gracious ! "
the boy broke off short , and with good reason .
the deer had spotted them , and now without warning turned and ran straight for both , as if to gore them to death !
chapter xiii .
a fish and a snake .
" look out , darry , or he 'll kill you ! "
" look out for yourself , <name> ! "
these cries were followed by two shots , as both the young hunters discharged their weapons .
but in their haste the aim of each was poor , and the bullets flew wide of the <name> .
then the maddened deer came closer , and both boys took to their heels , running as they had never run before .
" hi !
what 's up ? "
came in old benson 's voice .
" the deer are after us ! "
yelled <name> .
" shoot 'em quick ! "
hardly had the lad spoken when he felt one of the deer close behind him .
he leaped to one side , and the animal charged past with great vigor , considering how badly he was wounded .
but that charge was his last , for benson 's rifle spoke up , and the animal fell lifeless where he stood .
in the meantime darry was having his hands full with the second deer .
the youth had been unable to reload , and now he found himself in a thicket , with the deer fairly on top of him .
he caught his firearm by the barrel and hit the animal a resounding blow on the head .
this made the deer stagger back and pause .
" help !
help ! "
yelled the boy .
" somebody shoot this beast ! "
" i 'm coming ! "
came in captain moore 's voice .
" where are you ? "
" here , in the bush !
quick , or he 'll stick me to death ! "
the deer was now charging with lowered head .
he was in a fearful rage .
as he came on there was a sharp report , and the young captain burst into view , his rifle barrel still smoking .
then the deer gave one last leap into the air , and came down upon darry .
the fall knocked the boy senseless .
while captain moore was removing the weight from darry 's body , the old scout came up , followed by <name> .
" hullo , he got it , did he ? "
said benson .
" is he badly hurt ? "
" i <name> not , " answered the young captain .
" you see , the deer didn't touch him until i fired .
then he leaped up and knocked my cousin down . "
" <name> there aint any bones broken . "
the deer was removed , and benson went off to get some water .
when he came back captain moore and <name> were rubbing darry 's wrists .
the water was dashed into the unconscious youth 's face , and soon he gave a gasp and opened his eyes .
" the deer ? "
were his first words .
" you are safe , " said the captain <unk> .
" the deer is dead . "
" oh ! "
darry uttered a sigh of relief .
" i was thinking he was <unk> me to pieces . "
" you had a narrow escape , " put in old benson .
" if it had n't been for the captain he would have mauled you for certain .
did n't you hear me yell to be careful ? "
" i thought it would be an easy matter to bring him down , after he was wounded , " said darry , still gasping for breath .
" any bones broken ? "
questioned captain moore .
" i  i guess not . "
darry gave a sigh and sat up .
" how did <name> make out ? "
" i am all right , " answered that individual .
" benson did the trick for me though .
benson , i owe you a good deal . "
" and i owe you a good deal , " said darry , turning to his cousin .
" i 'm glad i came up , darry , " answered the young captain .
" after this both you and <name> must be more careful .
if either of you had been killed i would never have forgiven myself for bringing you out on the hunt . "
" i want to give you both a bit of advice , and i want you to remember it too , " came from the old scout .
" never get too close to big game until you are certain of what you are doing , and be extry careful of big game that is wounded and cornered .
even a sneaking fox <name> turn on you if he sees there is no other way out of his difficulty . "
" i 'll remember that , " answered both <name> and darry , and they did remember , and thus was one peril of <unk> hunting abolished .
darry felt too weak for the time being to do much , so <name> led him back to where they had left the horses , while captain moore and old benson took upon themselves the task of bringing in the four deer .
each was a beautiful prize , and the <unk> made an imposing sight when <name> up on a couple of tree branches .
" the colonel <name> like this haul , " said the young captain .
" it <name> mean prime venison for some days to come .
benson , i wish we could get some of it back to the fort without delay  so we can put it on ice and keep it nice . "
" i 'll take 'em all to the fort to-night , if you say so , " answered the scout .
" i can take one on my horse , and load the other three on one of the other animals . "
" then do that , and while at the fort ask the colonel if he <name> give me permission to remain out until saturday .
tell him we think we can bring in something for all hands to enjoy . "
" i 'll do it , " said the old scout .
soon the deer were packed on the horses , old benson having first cut some steaks from the smallest of the game , to leave behind .
" take good care of yourselves while i am gone , " he said on departing .
" and you , <name> and darry , mind what i told you about getting cornered . "
then he was off , and a turn in the mountain trail soon hid him from view .
" a fine old fellow , " was <name> 's comment , when benson was gone .
" he is that , " answered the young captain .
" i liked him from the first time i saw him , and i have never had cause to regret it .
he is a good <name> , an excellent scout , and has done us many a good turn . "
" what shall we do while he is absent ? "
questioned darry .
" oh , we can try our hand at small game and we can fish ! "
answered the young captain .
" as it is , i reckon both of you would just as lief take it easy until morning . "
" i would .
that deer on me has made me feel sore all over . "
they were soon in camp again , and while the boys rested captain moore stirred around and showed them how the soldiers prepared their meals .
he cooked the steaks to a turn , and boiled a pot of coffee , and these , with some crackers they had brought along , made a most excellent meal .
being in no hurry , they took their time over the repast , and it was dark long before they finished .
" it 's going to be a fine night , so we can sleep under the trees without fear , " said the young captain .
" do n't you think some wild animals <name> attack us ? "
" not if we keep our camp-fire burning . "
the boys brought in plenty of brush and some heavier wood , and arranged it so that it would burn for a long while , doing this by forming the stuff into something of a circle .
then the horses were looked after , and each retired , with his blanket rolled around him to keep off the mountain dew , which was already showing itself .
when the boys awoke the sun was shining brightly into their faces .
for a moment each stared at the other .
" gracious , i never slept so soundly in my life ! "
cried <name> .
" i couldn't have done better in a bed at home . "
" nor i , " returned his cousin .
" i can tell you , sleeping in the open air when it does n't rain is all right . "
but when darry got up on his feet he changed his tune .
the fall of the day previous , combined with the night air , had made him <unk> stiff , and it was a good half-hour before he became <unk> up .
they found captain moore already stirring , and the kettle over the fire was boiling merrily .
the captain himself was trying his luck at a <name> not a great distance off .
" i saw some fish in here some weeks ago , " he explained .
" i thought i might get a couple for breakfast .
but you lads <name> have to wait until i strike luck . "
" i 'm willing to wait , " said <name> .
" there is nothing to do , is there , until benson gets back ? "
" nothing that i know of , unless you want to fish or go after some small game .
i want to hear what he has to say .
if the colonel wo n't let me stay out , i 'll have to return to the fort to-night . "
it did not take long for captain moore to land several good-sized specimens of the <unk> tribe , and these the boys took turns at preparing for eating , while the captain continued to fish .
the balance of the morning was passed at the <name> , and , strange to say , the captain and <name> were both quite successful , while darry hardly got a bite .
" i 'm going to try my luck further up the stream , " announced the boy .
" i believe we are all fishing too closely together . "
" that does n't seem to hurt my luck , " said <name> .
darry was soon climbing the rocks leading up the <name> .
the way was rough , but he was growing used to this life in the open air and he enjoyed even the hardship , if such it can be called .
" that ought to make a good <unk> , " he said to himself , as he reached a point where several big rocks <name> over the water 's edge .
" it 's dark down there , and that 's what some fish like . "
he prepared his bait with care , and then dropped his line into the hole .
almost immediately he felt a nibble , and , giving a jerk , found he had caught something that was both large and powerful .
" gracious , it must be a whopper ! "
he muttered , as the fish darted hither and thither .
then he braced back on the rock , to play the game , for bringing in the catch at once seemed out of the question .
the pole bent greatly , and he was afraid it would snap on him .
he could not stand on the slippery rock very well , and so stepped behind it , on a number of loose stones .
hardly had he done so when he heard a strange hissing .
looking down , he saw a snake glide from under the rock .
in a moment more the angry reptile faced him .
chapter xiv .
over the mountain top .
darry was much alarmed , and with good reason .
never before had he faced such a snake , and the reptile looked ready to spring upon him at any instant .
what to do the boy did not know , yet instinctively he leaped back to the top of the rock .
then the fish gave a jerk which almost took him from his feet .
" <name> !
<name> ! "
he shouted .
" come this way !
i 'm in a pickle ! "
" what 's the matter ? "
shouted captain moore , and soon he and his brother were coming forward as quickly as they could .
in the meantime darry was having his hands full , for the big fish was bound to get away .
at the bottom of the rock lay the snake , with head raised and mouth wide open .
its eyes shone like diamonds .
" a snake !
kill it ! "
shrieked darry .
" a snake ? "
echoed <name> .
" where ? "
" at the bottom of this big rock .
oh , my , he 's going to come up ! "
" i see him , " put in captain moore .
as he spoke the snake made a leap for the top of the rock .
as the reptile went up , darry went down , and ran along the <name> 's edge , still with his <unk> in his hand .
catching up a sharp stone , captain moore flung it at the snake , hitting the reptile in the tail .
at once the thing whirled around , and now forgetting darry it turned on its assailant .
" he 's coming for you ! "
ejaculated <name> .
" run , <name> , or you 'll be bitten sure ! "
" i 'm not running from a snake , " answered the young officer , and in a trice he whipped out his pistol .
as the snake came on he let drive .
his aim was true , and the snake dropped with its head half severed from its body .
" good for you ! "
said <name> , and now he picked up a stone as large as his hand .
this he dropped directly on the quivering head , and thus ended the battle , although the body of the snake continued to wriggle for a long while afterward .
with white face and set teeth , darry continued to play his catch and he was still at it when <name> and his brother came rushing up .
" did the snake bite you ? "
questioned the young captain .
" why did n't you pull in ? "
" i 've got something big on , " answered darry .
" i did n't want to miss it . "
" well , i never ! "
gasped captain moore .
" and you did n't let go even with that snake at your heels ?
well , you like a fish better than i do , i can tell you that . "
again the pole bent and threatened to break , but darry knew what he was doing , and promptly let the fish have more line .
then he wound in , and as the fish unexpectedly came close to shore he gave a sudden strong , steady sweep , and up came the prize on the rocks , flapping and <unk> violently .
" my , what a whopper ! "
cried <name> .
" he must weigh at least seven or eight pounds ! "
" he felt as if he weighed about forty when he was in the water , " returned darry , a little <unk> that the catch was not larger .
" that 's the biggest fish i 've ever seen taken out of this stream , " said the young captain .
" you can be proud of it , darry .
but to hold on when that snake was behind you   " he shook his head .
" oh , i knew you 'd come up and take care of that , cousin <name> . "
" but i might have been too late . "
" was it a poisonous one ? "
" some claim they are poisonous , but the surgeon up at the fort says not .
still i would n't want to risk a bite . "
" perhaps there are more around , " suggested <name> .
" no , the peculiarity of this variety of snakes is that they always travel alone .
if they meet they fight until one or the other is dead . "
" did you ever see such a fight , <name> ? "
" i did , when i first came to these parts .
i was riding over a <name> trail when my horse suddenly stopped , nearly throwing me .
on looking ahead to find out what had frightened my animal , i discovered two of these snakes .
they were facing each other , with mouths wide open and fangs showing .
each was so interested in the other that neither noticed me or the horse .
they faced each other for fully a minute , and during that time began to hiss louder and louder .
suddenly they sprang at each other , and one snake was stung in the eye .
he curled himself around the other snake 's neck , and in an instant both were in a tight ball .
they rolled around and around among the rocks .
once in a while a head would show itself , and then there would be more hissing .
after ten minutes the ball fell gradually apart , and then one snake crawled slowly away , more dead than alive .
the other snake proved to be dead , with both eyes torn from its head . "
" did n't you kill the other snake ? "
asked darry .
" i did .
that 's the first and only battle i ever saw between snakes , and it was terrible while it lasted , i can tell you that . "
fishing over , they went into camp , and here rested until old benson came back .
" the colonel was tickled to death to receive so much deer meat , " said the old scout .
" and he says you can stay until saturday night if you wish .
his <name> said she had been wanting some venison for several weeks . "
captain moore felt glad to think he could be out four days more .
" we 'll have a grand time now , " he said .
" benson , we can go right over yonder mountain , ca n't we ? "
" to be sure , " answered the scout .
" is the hunting good over there ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , lad .
there used to be some buffalo there . "
" good !
let us get a buffalo by all means ! "
cried darry .
" you go slow about <unk> a buffalo , especially a bull , " said the young captain .
" if we do sight a buffalo you let benson manage the whole affair . "
it was not long before the party were off once more , up a trail which led directly to the mountain top .
here traveling was difficult , and both riders and horses were glad to rest at frequent intervals .
when the top was gained the sun was just sinking in the far west .
the sight on every side was a glorious one , and as the captain had a small <unk> with him , they could see for miles .
" there is the fort , " said <name> , after looking through the glass .
" i can see the flag quite plainly . "
in the west were more mountains , and between these the valley for which they were bound .
timber and underbrush were dense in spots , while at other points the mountain sides were covered with bold , blackish rocks , with here and there luxuriant moss of several hues .
springs and <name> were numerous , so there was no danger of a water famine .
" i can make out some game over yonder , " said darry , when he had the glass adjusted to his sight .
" what is it ? "
" i ca n't see very plainly . "
" hand over the glass , " said old benson , and took a careful look .
but the setting sun now cast a deep shadow between the mountains , and he was unable to tell what it was .
" mountain deer , most likely , " he said .
" we 'll find out to-morrow  if the good weather holds out . "
" do you think we 'll have a storm ? "
asked <name> quickly .
" we 'll have something ; do n't you think so , captain ? "
" i think we 'll have more wind than rain , " returned captain moore .
" if we have a high wind , <name> it be safe right on the mountain top ? "
questioned <name> .
" we wo n't stay here , " said old benson .
" i know of a much better <unk> .
come , while it is still a little light . "
and they set off once more .
the place the old scout had in mind was close beside a <name> .
the wall of rocks was twice as high as their heads , and on either side was a growth of heavy timber .
there was a spring at hand and a grassy patch which promised them an easy bed , providing it did not rain .
" if it storms we can seek the shelter of the <name> , " said old benson .
" it wo n't be as comfortable as a house or cabin , but it <name> be a good deal better than being right in the open . "
the boys were glad enough to rest after the wearisome ride over the top of the mountain , and hungry for the meal the old scout took upon himself to prepare .
when the fire was lit it burned up lively , blowing the sparks in several directions .
as soon as he finished cooking the meal benson put out the blaze .
" too much wind , " he said , in reply to a question from <name> .
" i do n't want to set the whole mountain side on fire . "
benson was right about the wind , which was now sweeping strongly through the tops of the tall trees .
presently it came lower , and shook up the brushwood .
the night birds began to fly around , uttering their shrill cries .
the old scout listened to the birds with some concern .
" it 's going to be a big blow , " he said to darry .
" you are sure ? "
" yes .
the birds are afraid of it .
see how they flutter around ?
that 's a sure sign . "
" birds must know a good deal , benson . "
" they do , lad  a heap sight more than folks gives 'em credit for .
we could learn a good deal from them , if we 'd only set our minds to it . "
they took their time about eating , having nothing else to do .
then benson cared for the horses , putting them in the shelter of the brush , but away from the big trees .
at last it began to blow in <name> , and presently they heard a tree limb here and there snap with a loud report .
then the wind became so furious they were glad enough to huddle under the <name> for shelter .
" it 's coming now ! "
shouted old benson suddenly .
" hold fast to your hats , boys , or you 'll never see them again .
and sit down on the traps ! "
and in a moment more the fury of the wind storm was upon them .
chapter xv .
the result of a hurricane .
both <name> and darry had witnessed many a blow , but nothing to compare to that which now swept through the valley and up the mountain side .
the velocity of the wind was simply terrific , and it was well that old benson had cautioned them to hold on to their hats and sit on their traps , otherwise all would have been blown away to parts unknown .
" say , but this is fierce ! "
gasped darry , after several minutes had passed .
" it 's a regular hurricane , " said captain moore .
" i 've been out in them before .
fortunately they do not last over a quarter or half an hour .
down on the prairies of kansas they would call it a cyclone .
here , however , it ca n't get the sweep that it can on the level . "
" hark !
what is that ? "
put in <name> , as a tremendous crashing reached their ears .
" that 's a tree in the forest going down , " answered old benson .
" there goes another , " said darry , as more crashing was heard .
" i am glad we did n't go into the timber .
it 's more dangerous than lightning . "
" so it is ! "
shouted benson .
it was with difficulty that he made himself heard .
" here comes the worse of it ! "
he added .
a strange humming now filled the air , followed by twigs and flying branches .
overhead it was unusually dark , and they could scarcely see one another .
<name> and darry kept close together and clasped hands .
captain moore was on one side of them and old benson on the other .
as the wind struck the <name> it sent a shower of loose stones in all directions .
then it tore through the undergrowth where the horses were tethered .
next it seemed to hit the trees fronting the <name> .
one tall monarch of the forest was twisted completely from its roots and began to <unk> .
" see , the tree is coming on top of us ! "
shrieked <name> .
his words were drowned out in the fury of the wind and the crashing of the tree .
the next moment the monarch of the forest came down on the <name> with a bang , cracking the stone in several places .
the bottom limbs caught those under the <name> and pinned them fast .
to both boys it seemed as if the end of the world had come .
they rolled over , one on top of the other , and for several seconds lay dazed .
then they tried to get up , but found themselves unable to do so .
" get off of my chest ! "
gasped <name> , who was underneath .
" i ca n't  i 'm pinned down ! "
panted darry .
" boys , are you safe ? "
came from old benson , who was also caught .
" i  i guess so ! "
answered <name> .
" but it 's a tight squeeze . "
then the youth called out to his brother , but no answer came back .
" <name> must be hurt ! "
he exclaimed , his heart rising in his throat .
" <name> !
<name> !
where are you ? "
he continued .
still there was no answer , or if so the fury of the wind drowned it out completely .
the boys tried their best to move , but could only budge a few inches .
in five minutes the fury of the blow spent itself and the last of the wind sent the fallen tree rolling along the <name> a distance of several rods .
this released <name> and darry , and they arose to their feet dazed and bewildered and scarcely knowing what to do next .
it was now raining and darker than ever .
" benson ! "
called out <name> , " where is my brother ? "
" the captain must still be under the tree , " replied the old scout .
" he was next to you when the tree came down , was n't he ? "
" he was , but i believe the wind carried his hat off , and he made a dive for it .
that 's the last i saw of him . "
staggering to his feet , <name> looked around , trying to pierce the darkness .
darry followed him , and old benson also got up .
the scout had received a nasty cut on the shoulder , from which the blood was flowing .
in a few minutes <name> found his brother .
the captain lay on the rocks unconscious , a big lump on his forehead , where the largest of the <unk> branches had struck him .
kneeling at his brother 's side , the boy made a hasty examination .
" he 's alive ! "
he said .
" but he must have been struck a terrible crack . "
there was little to do excepting to bathe the unconscious <unk> head , and this was done .
in the meantime darry assisted old benson at binding up the wounded shoulder .
" take the tree off ! "
such were the first words captain moore uttered when he returned to consciousness .
it was some time before he could sit up .
" you are all right , <name>  the tree is not on you , " said <name> soothingly .
" but it came down right on top of me . "
" yes , it came down on all of us . "
" anybody killed ? "
" no .
benson has a cut on the shoulder , and you were knocked out .
feel the lump on your head . "
the young captain did so .
" phew !
but that 's a regular <unk> , is n't it ? "
he muttered .
" i suppose i can be thankful that i am alive . "
" we can all be thankful for that , <name> . "
" it was the greatest blow i ever experienced  in more ways than one , " said the captain .
" i see it is raining .
we had better go back to the <name> for protection . "
" do n't do it ! "
cried old benson , from out of the darkness .
" the tree struck the <name> a heavy blow , and we do n't want that down on our heads next . "
" no , let us give the <name> a wide berth , " said darry .
" i 'd rather remain right out in the open and get soaked than take any more risks . "
" the rain wo n't amount to much , " said benson .
" it never does after such a hurricane . "
the scout was right , and in less than half an hour after it had begun the downpour was over and the stars were struggling forth in the sky .
without delay a camp-fire was lit , and the blaze did much toward making them comfortable .
it was found that benson 's wound was by far the worst , yet the old scout said it would not interfere with his outing .
" i 've had lots of 'em in my time , " was the way he expressed himself .
" lots , and i aint dead yet .
'pears to me i 'm about as tough as a <unk> . "
it was found that the horses had not suffered in the least from the storm , although they had been much frightened .
soon they calmed down , and by midnight all was as quiet as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred .
but captain moore and old benson carried the marks of the adventure for many days after .
on the following morning no one felt much in the humor for hunting , and half a day was lost in " <unk> around , " as <name> expressed it .
this gave all a good rest and put the horses in fine <unk> , and when they started out after the midday meal all were once again in high spirits .
that night found them on the edge of what old benson called the buffalo ground , a broad valley where the grass was thick and of a peculiar richness .
on the way they had shot a number of birds and also a few small animals , but nothing of importance .
once some deer had been sighted , but the game was too far off to be pursued .
as they expected to remain at this point until ready to return home , the old scout proceeded to put up a shelter of brush , which , when completed , was almost as comfortable as a cabin .
on the bottom were strewn pine boughs , which gave the shelter a peculiar odor .
" best thing in the world for colds and weak lungs , that smell , " said benson .
" i 've never known it to fail . "
the boys declared that the odor made them sleep " like logs . "
" it 's queer we have n't seen any indians , " remarked darry .
" i thought these mountains were full of them . "
" they were full , before the fort was established , " answered benson .
" but the kind that are in this neighborhood do n't like white men very much , and they only come around the fort when it 's necessary .
but we may meet some after buffalo .
an injun <name> do a heap to get a critter like that . "
the old scout said it would be useless to go out in a body to look for buffalo , and so it was arranged that he should first go over the ground alone , leaving the captain and the two boys to look for smaller game .
this settled , benson soon set off , and a little later captain moore , <name> , and darry took their way along some bushes skirting a small water-course .
they went on foot , leaving their horses tethered near the shelter .
" i <name> go up one side of the stream , and you can go up the other , " said the captain .
" by doing that we 'll be sure to stir up anything within a hundred yards of the water . "
the boys agreed , and soon each member of the party was hard at work , on the hunt for any small game the vicinity might afford .
it was not long before they gained a spot where the underbrush along the <name> was thick .
here the stream divided into two branches , and , without knowing it , the captain and the boys became gradually more and more separated , the brush and small trees hiding each from the other .
" i do n't see much , " said <name> , after half a mile had been covered .
" those little birds are n't worth wasting powder and shot on . "
" it looks to me as if somebody had gone over this ground , " returned darry .
" see here , are n't those fresh footprints ? "
" i believe they are .
and see , here are the prints of several <unk> hoofs .
benson did n't come this way , did he ? "
" i do n't think he did . "
" then there must be other hunters not far off . "
they continued on their way , coming to a halt where the branch of the <name> entered a small , <name> canyon .
" no use of going further , " said <name> .
" let us retrace our steps . "
" where can your brother be ?
i have n't heard him for some time . "
<name> set up a yell , and both listened attentively .
no answer came back .
then both called in concert .
still the silence continued .
" it 's mighty queer , " was <name> 's comment " let us go back .
perhaps he 's in trouble . "
chapter xvi .
captain moore 's adventure .
in the meanwhile , never dreaming of the danger at hand , captain moore pursued his way up the other branch of the water-course .
here the underbrush was even more dense than where the boys were , and consequently he did not think it strange that he heard nothing of his brother and his cousin .
the fact that he stirred up no game nettled him , and he pushed on , determined to bring down something before he went back .
suddenly he espied something moving in the patch of wood ahead of him .
rifle in hand , he moved cautiously in the direction .
as he did this , a man glided out from the bushes to his right and followed him as silently as a shadow .
the man was <name> fetter .
the desperado was fully armed , and his face was black with hatred of the young army officer .
as the wood was gained , captain moore paused to locate the object he had seen .
but before he could do this , he was caught from behind and his rifle was wrenched from his grasp .
" fetter ! "
he ejaculated , as he caught sight of the desperado .
" up with your hands , captain moore ! "
growled the rascal savagely .
" up , i say !
i 've got the drop on you ! "
fetter had thrown the captain 's rifle to the ground , and now stood upon it .
in his hands he held his own weapon , and the muzzle was aimed at the young officer 's head .
realizing that discretion was the better part of valor , captain moore threw up his hands promptly , at which the desperado grinned wickedly .
" where did you come from , fetter ? "
demanded the captain .
" from not far away , captain . "
" what do you mean by treating a united states army officer in this fashion ? "
" i 've got a score to settle with you , captain .
do n't forget that . "
" are the rest of the gang around ? "
" they are . "
following his last words , <name> fetter gave a long , clear whistle , followed by two shorter ones .
at once an answer came back from the woods , and in a few seconds <name> gilroy appeared .
" hullo , so you 've got him , " sang out the leader of the desperadoes .
" a good haul .
how are you , captain moore ?
delighted to see me , i suppose . "
" not at all glad to meet you  considering the circumstances , " answered the young officer , trying to keep cool , although he realized that he was in a dangerous situation .
" well , you 're honest about it , anyway , " said gilroy with a brutal laugh .
" have you been following our party ? "
" you had better not ask too many questions , captain . "
by this time potts and two other men were coming up .
one of the latter carried his left arm in a sling .
captain moore 's recognized him as a fellow who had been wounded in the raid on the quartermaster 's party .
the desperadoes consulted among themselves for a few minutes , and then captain moore was ordered to march on .
" to where ? "
he asked .
" you 'll see when you get there , " answered fetter .
" now move , or , by the boots , i shoot you down where you stand ! "
seeing it would be worse than useless to resist , the young officer did as ordered , and the whole party moved away from the water-course and took to a trail leading back to the side of the mountain .
presently they came upon a number of horses , and here they mounted .
there were two steeds without riders , and captain moore was ordered to the back of one of these .
all rode off in a bunch , the prisoner being kept in the center of the party .
he had been searched and his pistol taken from him , also his pocket-knife , <unk> , and his money and jewelry .
in less than quarter of an hour a split in the mountain side was gained .
to the rear was something of a cave , the entrance overgrown with brush and vines .
at the mouth of the cave the party came to a halt , and were met by several other desperadoes .
" now you can get down , " said gilroy .
" fetter , i guess we had better bind his hands behind him . "
" you are going to bind me ? "
queried captain moore .
" and why not ?
you are such a nice chap , captain , we do n't want to part with you just yet . "
" why are you going to keep me a prisoner ? "
" well , do n't forget that we hold you responsible for that little mix-up when we were after the quartermaster 's <unk> . "
" i only did my duty , gilroy . "
" perhaps ; but if it had n't been for you and your men our gang would have been about twenty thousand dollars richer than we are to-day . "
" and i would n't have this lame arm , " growled the fellow who had been wounded .
" as i said before , i only did my duty , " repeated the captain calmly .
" even if i had n't arrived , do n't you suppose the quartermaster would have done all he could to defend himself ? "
" certainly ; but his party numbered only three .
however , we wo n't talk now .
we have other things to do .
get into that cave .
and do n't try to escape , or it <name> be the worse for you . "
with a downcast heart the young officer entered the cave , which was an old rendezvous of the desperadoes .
inside were a rude table and a couple of benches , and he threw himself down on one of the latter .
one of the gang , potts , put himself on guard outside , rifle in hand .
the others separated into two parties , and went off again .
" can they be going after <name> and darry , or after benson ? "
was the question the captain asked himself .
he waited until the <unk> outside had entirely ceased , then called to potts .
" where are they going ? "
he asked .
" that 's captain gilroy 's business , " was the answer .
" oh , so you call gilroy captain now ? "
" we do . "
" how many men is he captain of ? "
" about thirty , if you 're anxious to know . "
" thirty !
there are not that number of desperadoes within three hundred miles of this place . "
" all right , if you know better than i do . "
" has the captain gone off for the rest of my party ? "
" perhaps he has . "
" it wo n't do him any good to make them prisoners . "
" i reckon he knows his own business best , captain moore . "
" and what <name> you get out of this affair , potts ? "
" me ?
i 'll get my share when we make another haul . "
" do you expect to make another haul soon ? "
" as i said afore , better ask the captain .
we 're organized into a regular company now , and all the privates like me have to do is to obey orders .
you know how it is in the regular army . "
" a company of desperadoes , " mused captain moore .
" that 's something we have n't had out here in years . "
potts would talk no more after this , but sat down on a rock to smoke his pipe and continue his guard duty .
the young captain had had his hands bound tightly behind him , and , try his best , he found himself unable to either break or slip his bonds .
he was anxious concerning himself , but he was even more upset concerning his brother and his cousin .
" if they kick up a fuss , more than likely gilroy and the others <name> shoot them down ! "
he groaned .
" it 's too bad !
i thought we would have a splendid time hunting , and here we are , falling into all sorts of difficulties . "
as impatient as he was , he could do nothing but stalk around the cave .
the place was five yards wide by over a hundred feet long .
to the rear was a rude fireplace , the smoke drifting through some wide cracks overhead .
a small fire was burning , and he kicked a fresh log on the blaze , which soon gave him more light .
then he sat down again .
as he rested , his eyes roamed around the <name> apartment , and presently fell upon a sheet of paper lying under the table .
curious to know what it might contain , he bent down backwards , and by an effort secured the paper and placed it upon the table .
then , by the flickering flames , he tried to make out the writing it contained .
the letter  for such the sheet proved to be  was a communication which had been sent to <name> gilroy by a writer who signed himself <name> .
it ran as follows : " the plan <name> work perfectly , and all we must do is to wait until the money is at the fort .
i am sure the soldiers <name> leave as requested , and the defense <name> amount to little or nothing .
<name> see to it that colonel fairfield is drugged , and <name> treat captain moore and the other officers the same way , if i can get the chance . "
chapter xvii .
three prisoners .
it did not take <name> and darry long to retrace their steps at the water-course .
they continued to call to the young captain , and once <name> shot off his rifle as a signal , but , as we know , no answer came back .
" i ca n't understand this at all , " said <name> , when they halted near the shelter .
" i did n't hear him do any firing , did you ? "
" not a shot , " answered darry .
" he must have gone away from the <name> instead of along the bank . "
the two boys <name> around the shelter for some time , and then decided to follow up the trail left by the young officer .
this was easy for part of the distance , but soon the footprints became so indistinct that they came to another halt .
" stumped ! "
muttered <name> .
" we might as well go back to the shelter and wait till he returns .
one thing is certain , he has n't found any game , or we would have heard the firing . "
tired by their long tramp the boys sat down in the shelter , thinking that captain moore would return at any moment .
thus an hour was passed .
it was now noon , and <name> and darry set to work to prepare dinner for themselves .
the repast was just finished when <name> let out a cry of alarm .
" <name> gilroy ! "
he was right .
the captain of the desperadoes had appeared , followed by several others .
the boys were taken completely off their guard .
darry made a clutch for his rifle , but on the instant gilroy had him covered .
" leave the gun alone ! "
cried the rascal .
" leave it alone , or it <name> be the worse for you . "
" what do you want ? "
questioned <name> .
" we want you to behave yourselves , " answered fetter , who was in the crowd .
" you played us a nice trick that time you escaped from the cave , " growled gilroy , eying <name> darkly .
" do you blame me for wanting to get away ? "
" hardly .
but i 'll warrant you wo n't get away again . "
" then you consider me your prisoner ? "
" i do . "
" oh , <name> , do you think they met <name>   " began darry , and then stopped short .
" yes , your brother is waiting to meet you , " said fetter , addressing <name> .
" then he is also a prisoner ? "
" yes . "
<name> 's heart sank within him .
" if old benson was only here ! "
he muttered .
still guarding the boys , the desperadoes took their guns and also a pistol the young captain had loaned his brother .
" now get on your horses , " commanded gilroy .
" and mind , if you try to play us foul both of you <name> get shot . "
" are you going to take us to captain moore ? "
asked darry .
" perhaps . "
the desperadoes would answer no more questions , and in a few minutes the whole party was off for the cave .
both darry and <name> wished to leave behind some sort of message which benson might pick up , but they were watched so closely they could do nothing .
when the cave was gained the boys were told to go inside and keep quiet .
" <name> !
and you too , darry ! "
cried captain moore .
" i was afraid of this . "
" no wonder we could n't find you ! "
said <name> , and told of the hunt he and his cousin had made .
" these rascals are up to some deep game , " whispered the young captain .
" i just picked up a message which gilroy must have dropped , " and he told what the sheet contained .
" if i were you i 'd burn the paper , " said darry .
" then he wo n't know you have seen it . "
" no , i would like to keep the sheet   to show to colonel fairfield if i can manage to get away . "
" who wrote the message ? "
" i have no idea .
there used to be a half-breed around here whom the soldiers called <name> , but i thought he was dead .
he was thick with the <unk> indians . "
" then if he was the writer that would show that the indians are going to help the desperadoes , would n't it ? "
asked <name> .
before his brother could answer , <name> gilroy stalked into the cave .
" i told you not to talk , " he growled , as he cast his eye on the table and then around the <name> floor .
" you ca n't get away , so it wo n't do you any good to plot against me and my men . "
he was evidently looking for the sheet of paper , for presently he lit a torch and went over the whole cave carefully .
" see anything of a bit of paper around here ? "
he asked presently .
" what kind of a paper ? "
questioned darry .
" something with writing on it . "
" i have n't seen anything . "
" what was the writing about , gilroy ? "
asked captain moore .
" that 's my business .
then you have n't seen the paper ?
all right , " and the desperado stalked from the cave again .
" that was a close shave , " whispered the young captain .
" and it proves that the paper is valuable and that he is worried about it . "
slowly the balance of the day wore along , and at nightfall one of the men brought them a scanty supply of food .
they ate sparingly , fearing the food might be drugged , but no evil effects followed the meal .
at the mouth of the cave sat two of the desperadoes on guard , each with his rifle across his knees .
" a dash into the darkness might save us , " suggested darry , but the captain shook his head .
" no , those fellows are too good shots , " he said .
" we <name> have to remain as we are until something turns up in our favor . "
our friends wondered if the desperadoes would remain about the cave all night .
the other party which had gone off when gilroy went for <name> and darry had not yet returned , and the leader of the gang seemed to grow anxious concerning them .
" something has happened to them , " he said to fetter .
" perhaps we had better send somebody off on the trail to find out what 's up . "
so it was agreed , and fetter was the man chosen for the mission .
as may have been surmised by some of my readers , the other party had gone off to watch for old benson and make him a prisoner .
the crowd numbered three , and were desperadoes well acquainted with that territory .
the old scout had spent several hours in a vain endeavor to locate some buffalo , when , on resting in the crotch of a tree , he saw the desperadoes approaching .
the rascals were tired out with their search for the scout , and came to a halt directly under the tree .
" it 's a fool errand , " old benson heard one of the men say .
" <name> gilroy ought to have been satisfied with <unk> captain moore and those boys . "
" the captain wants to make a grand round-up , " answered another of the men .
" he told me that if we missed benson the scout might make trouble . "
benson listened to this conversation with intense interest , and soon learned the truth  that captain moore was already a prisoner , and that another party had gone off to bring in <name> and darry .
" this is a nice state of affairs , " he thought .
" these rascals mean mischief .
i wish i could get the drop on them .
i 'd soon teach them a thing or two . "
he watched the men as a cat watches mice , and , when the party of three moved on , stole after them like an indian on the warpath .
the desperadoes skirted the brushwood , but did not go out on the grassy slope of the valley , fearing that the old scout might be near by in hiding and see them .
they were a shiftless lot , and soon came to another halt , under some small trees .
here they threw themselves on the ground , and while two of them smoked their pipes the third indulged in a nap .
not a great distance off was a spring of pure cold water , and presently one of the men got up and walked over to this to get a drink .
" my chance for number one ! "
muttered old benson , and crawled after the desperado .
as the man turned the corner of a number of rocks , he came up behind , clapped his hands over the fellow 's mouth , and bore him to the earth .
chapter xviii .
benson puts some men in a hole .
the man whom old benson had attacked was taken completely by surprise , and he went to the ground easily .
but , once down , he struggled fiercely to release himself , and at the same time did his best to cry out for assistance .
" silence ! "
commanded the scout in a whisper .
" if you yell , it <name> go hard with you . "
the desperado now saw who had attacked him , and his face changed color .
but he continued to struggle , and was on the point of breaking away when the old scout hit him a heavy blow on the ear , which bowled him over and rendered him partly unconscious .
" hi !
did you call ? "
came from the other man who had been smoking .
old benson looked at the man before him , and saw that the fellow would be unable to do anything for several minutes to come .
" yes , " he answered , in a rough voice .
" here 's something funny to look at .
come quick . "
at once the second man leaped up , and without stopping to pick up his rifle came to the spring .
old benson quickly stepped behind a bush , out of sight .
" hullo , <name> , what 's the trouble ? "
cried the second man when he beheld his prostrate companion .
he bent over <name> , and while he was making an examination old benson came behind him and threw him as he had thrown the first desperado .
but the second man was " game , " and the struggle lasted for several minutes .
at one time it looked as if the old scout would get the worst of the encounter , but in the end he triumphed and the rascal was disarmed .
all the time the struggle was going on benson had been afraid the third man would rouse up , especially as the second called several times for help .
but the rascal had now fallen into a heavy sleep , and heard nothing .
what to do with the two desperadoes before him the old scout did not know , until he suddenly thought of a big <unk> hole he had discovered that very morning , while hunting for buffalo tracks .
the hole was fifteen to twenty feet in diameter and twice as deep , and once at the bottom he felt certain the desperadoes would have considerable trouble in getting to the top .
" come with me , " he said to the second fellow .
" and no monkey shines , if you know when you are well off . "
" wot <name> goin ' to do wid me ? "
growled the desperado .
" you 'll see .
your blood is so hot it needs cooling off , " answered the old scout .
he forced the man along , and soon the big hole was reached .
much against his <name> , the rascal was forced to drop to the bottom .
" now , if you try to climb up i 'll shoot you , " said benson , and ran back swiftly to where the second rascal was just getting out of his unconscious state .
before the other desperado could realize what was coming he , too , was down in the big hole .
old benson made certain that each of the men was relieved of all his weapons .
" now , i 'm going to keep watch on you , " he said , as a warning .
" be careful of what you try to do . "
" do n't leave us here ! "
pleaded <name> .
" a buffalo or a bear might fall in on us . "
" you 've got to take your chances on that , " answered benson .
the next movement of the old scout was to go back to where the third man was sleeping .
it was an easy matter to secure all the weapons belonging to this fellow .
then benson procured a rope from their outfit , and bound his feet together and then his hands .
during the latter operation the rascal awoke .
" wot <name> doin ' ? "
he demanded sleepily , and then , seeing the old scout , stared in open-mouthed astonishment .
" let go o ' me !
wot did <name> tie me up fer ? "
" you keep quiet , " said benson , with a broad smile over the trick he had played .
" whar 's <name> an ' <unk> ? "
" not far off . "
" did they go ter sleep too ? "
" you can ask them when you see them , <name> . "
" so you know me , do <name> ? "
" i do , and i have n't forgotten that affair at mountain meadow , " went on old benson , referring to a shooting in which <name> had been the guilty party .
at these words the desperado winced .
" well , now ye have got me fast , wot <name> goin ' to do with me ? "
he questioned .
" i 'm going to ask you a few questions , <name> , and i want you to answer me straight , too .
if i learn you 've given it to me crooked , i'll fix you for it , remember that . "
" wot do <name> want to know ? "
" where are gilroy and the rest of your crowd stopping ? "
" wot do <name> want to know that fur ? "
" answer the question  and tell me the truth , " and old benson looked sternly at his prisoner .
" at a cave near bald top , " returned <name> sulkily .
" but i do n't know how long they were goin ' ter stay there . "
" where were they going to take captain moore ? "
this question came as a surprise to the desperado .
" wot do <name> know about dat ? "
he cried .
" answer the question . "
" goin ' ter take him to dat same cave , first . "
" and then ? "
" dey was bound fer lone creek , up to where old <unk> onct had a claim . "
" you are telling me the truth ?
remember , if you put me on the wrong trail   " " it 's the truth , benson .
but , say , do n't be rough on me .
i aint such a bad egg .
dat shootin '   " " i know all about you , <name> .
now come with me . "
reaching down , the old scout untied the rascal 's feet , that he might walk , and then forced <name> to journey to the big hole .
here they found the other two desperadoes sitting at the bottom , growling over their luck and speculating upon what old benson intended to do next .
" if you leave us here we 'll die of hunger and thirst , " said one .
" no , you wo n't , " answered the old scout .
" you 've got your hands to work with , and if you aint lazy you can dig your way to the top inside of twenty-four hours . "
" and our hosses ? "
" i 'll take care of them , <name> .
if you want 'em again you can get 'em by applying at the fort . "
" at the fort ! "
" exactly , and in the meantime we 'll keep them in exchange for the animals <name> gilroy stole , when i and my friends were stopping at <name> leeson 's cabin . "
with the desperadoes safe for the time being at the bottom of the hole , old benson set off without delay for the cave near bald top mountain , as it was called for years by <name> mountain pioneers .
he rode his own horse , leading the others by his lariat , which he always carried with him .
he fully realized that there was danger ahead , and that if he wanted to assist his friends he must move with caution .
he knew that captain moore had been made a prisoner , but whether or not <name> and darry had been captured also was still a question .
coming in sight of the spot where the cave was located , he dismounted and tied all the horses in the woods at the foot of a slope .
then he crawled forward until he was within a hundred feet of the entrance to the cave .
he was just in time to see fetter depart on his mission .
the desperado passed within fifty yards of where the horses were stationed , and for several minutes benson was fearful that the animals would be discovered .
but fetter was looking in another direction , and so saw nothing of the steeds .
as darkness had come on , the desperadoes had lit a camp-fire near the entrance to the cave .
two men still remained on guard .
the others took it easy , and did very much as they pleased .
all waited for <name> and the others to return with fetter , bringing in old benson as a prisoner .
as the scout heard the talk about himself he chuckled grimly and grasped his rifle tighter than ever .
" reckon you 'd be surprised to know i was so close , " he muttered .
" well , if it comes to a mix-up , i 'll try to hold up my end , just you see if i do n't ! "
chapter xix .
escaping in the darkness .
it was after midnight when the camp settled down to rest .
fetter had not returned , and <name> gilroy was much worried in consequence .
yet he was tired out , having lost a good portion of the night previous in traveling , and he lay down with the others .
the guards at the entrance to the cave had been changed .
those now there were two young men , recruits to the desperadoes ' organization .
inside of the cave captain moore , <name> , and darry , having untied each other 's bonds , held a long consultation , the upshot of which was that they intended to escape if the deed could be accomplished .
" there is no use in telling you that we <name> run a big risk , " said the captain .
" but as for myself , these rascals are plotting against colonel fairfield and the soldiers at the fort , and i feel it my duty to do my best toward getting away and warning my commander . "
" whatever you do , <name> , i <name> back you up , so far as i am able , " was his brother 's answer .
" and i <name> back you up , too , " came from darry .
" but we must be cautious , for these desperadoes <name> not hesitate to shoot , and shoot to kill . "
and the boy shivered in spite of himself , for no matter how brave a person may be he seldom cares to run the risk of losing his life .
the prisoners had been ordered to keep to the back of the cave , but after all but the guards had retired captain moore made bold enough to walk carefully to the mouth of the place .
" hi , you want to keep back there , " growled one of the guards , promptly raising his rifle .
" do n't be hard on us , " pleaded the captain .
" let me get a little fresh air .
it 's vile in the back of the cave . "
" orders were to keep you out of sight , " growled the second guard .
" all right , i 'll go back as soon as i 've cleaned out my lungs . "
while the captain was speaking he was peering around sharply , trying to locate the other desperadoes and ascertain what the chances of escape really were .
as he gazed first to one side and then the other , he caught sight of a hand waving in the air .
a second later he made out the head and shoulders of old benson , as the scout rose to his feet behind some brushwood .
the thought that the scout was at hand to assist them cheered the young officer wonderfully , and he <name> a deep breath of satisfaction .
" are you going back soon ? "
growled one of the guards .
" yes , " answered the captain .
" but i say , " he went on , " why ca n't we come to terms ? "
" do n't want to make any terms with you , " growled the other guard .
" it might be better for you to do so . "
" we know our own business best , captain .
you just go back as you was ordered to do .
if you do n't   " " i do n't feel safe in the cave , men , to tell the truth .
what is that pounding overhead ? "
" pounding overhead ? "
" yes . "
" do n't know of any pounding .
do you , <name> ? "
" nary a bit , " replied the other guard .
by this time <name> and darry were just behind the young officer .
" watch out , " whispered captain moore .
" old benson is outside , in the bushes on the left . "
" good for him ! "
whispered <name> joyfully .
" what are you talking about ? "
demanded one of the guards .
" i want to know about that pounding overhead , " said captain moore .
" i do n't want the roof to cave in on us . "
he spoke so decidedly that both of the guards were deceived .
" nobody is up there , " said one of the two .
" it must be some wild animal . "
" ca n't one of you go up and look ? "
asked the young officer .
" you want the chance to get away , " was the suspicious answer .
" how can we get away , when we are unarmed and you have that rifle , " went on the captain , speaking loudly , for old benson 's benefit .
" it won't take you a minute to look . "
the men , however , refused to budge .
" we 'll stay right here , " said one , and the other nodded <unk> .
in the meantime old benson had crawled closer , until he was directly behind the pair .
now of a sudden he leaped between them , and as quick as a flash caught their rifles and twisted the weapons from their grasp .
[ illustration : " he leaped between them and caught their rifles . " ]
as the old scout did this , the young captain also leaped in , followed by <name> and darry .
the guards struggled , but with four against them could do little or nothing .
one , however , had a powerful pair of lungs , and before he could be stopped , set up a loud cry of alarm .
" come with me ! "
cried old benson .
" be quick , or it <name> be too late ! "
he led the way to the wood where the horses were tethered , and the captain , <name> , and darry came close behind him .
hardly had they gotten away from the guards when the whole camp was in alarm .
" what 's the trouble ? "
demanded <name> gilroy , leaping to his feet and catching up his rifle .
" the prisoners have escaped ! "
answered one of the guards .
" we were attacked by some men from behind .
there they go ! "
" stop ! "
roared the leader of the desperadoes , and raised his rifle .
but before he could take aim our friends were behind the shelter of the trees .
it took but a few seconds to loosen the horses , and as the captain and the two boys had long since relieved themselves of their bonds they were soon in the saddle and following the old scout , who seemed to know the way perfectly , despite the darkness .
" it was lucky you came up , benson ! "
cried <name> , as they dashed along .
" wait , we are not yet out of this trouble , " answered benson .
" hark !
they are following ! "
he was right .
gilroy and several of his men had rushed to their horses , and were now coming along the forest trail at a good rate of speed .
but their horses were no better than the animals our friends rode , so the desperadoes did not succeed in cutting down the distance between the two parties , and at last gave up the <name> .
" it has been a most stirring adventure from start to finish , " said captain moore after each had told his story .
" and it brings to an end this outing .
i must now get to the fort without delay . "
" and i am perfectly willing to go along , " said darry .
" there is no fun in hunting in a country where the desperadoes are so thick . "
" this <name> open colonel fairfield 's eyes , " went on the young officer .
" i should n't be surprised if he organized another expedition against gilroy 's gang and did n't let up on them until they were all either in prison or shot down . "
" it 's what they deserve , " came from old benson .
" i 'll go on such a hunt with pleasure . "
our friends continued in the saddle all night and until ten o'clock the next morning .
then , tired and hot , they went into camp by a cooling stream .
here they went fishing , and soon caught enough fish for dinner , after which they took a nap lasting several hours .
" and now for the fort ! "
cried captain moore ; " and the sooner we get there the better . "
the nap had done the boys a world of good , and as they rode along their spirits rose so high that darry proposed a race .
<name> was willing , and away they went , along the well-defined trail , before either the young officer or the old scout could stop them .
" they are full of life , " said <name> 's brother .
" let them go .
we 'll make the fort to-night , even if they do tire the horses a bit . "
" it 's all right if they do n't get into trouble , " answered benson .
on and on went the two lads , down something of a slope and then along a level stretch .
the bushes grew thick upon both sides , and here and there were numerous wild flowers .
at last they reached a glade <name> with green grass .
<name> was slightly ahead when he came to a sudden halt .
" back , darry ! "
he cried .
" get back behind the bushes . "
" what 's up ? "
queried his cousin , as he brought his steed to a standstill .
" buffaloes ! "
" buffaloes !
where ? "
" right around the <name> on our right .
see , they are coming this way !
here 's luck . "
<name> was right ; they had come most unexpectedly upon a herd of seven buffaloes .
the shaggy beasts were all large and <unk> .
they were not in the least alarmed , and came toward the boys at a slow but steady walk .
chapter xx .
something about white ox .
" what shall we do , <name> ; wait until your brother and old benson come up ? "
asked darry , as they surveyed the approaching animals .
" i suppose we ought to wait , " answered <name> .
" but if they take alarm , they 'll be off in double-quick order , i am afraid . "
each of the boys brought around his rifle , which had been picked up on leaving the desperadoes ' rendezvous , and saw that it was ready for use .
" if we could only signal to the others ! "
suggested darry impatiently .
" one of us might go back , " began <name> , when he gave a sudden start .
" they see us !
see , they are turning away ! "
he cried .
hardly had he spoken when darry fired , aiming at the largest of the buffaloes .
<name> followed , with a second shot , aimed at the same beast .
both bullets reached their <name> , and the animal was hit in the breast and in the right <unk> .
" we hit him ! "
ejaculated darry .
" let us fire at him again ! "
and he started to reload with all speed .
when struck the buffalo uttered a bellow of pain and went down on his knees .
but he quickly arose , and now came straight for the boys , his head down , as if to gore them to death .
crack !
it was darry 's rifle which spoke up , and the buffalo staggered , hit on the head , a glancing blow , however , which did little damage .
by this time <name> had reloaded , but he did not fire at once , hoping to get a closer shot at the beast .
in the meantime the others of the herd had disappeared completely .
soon the buffalo was less than fifty yards off , and not daring to wait longer <name> took steady aim and let drive .
his <unk> had been pointed at one of those gleaming , <unk> eyes , and the bullet sped true , entering the <name> of the beast .
with a roar and a grunt the buffalo went down , tearing up a great patch of grass in his fall .
" hi !
what 's all the shooting about ? "
the cry came from benson , as he rode down the trail at a breakneck speed , rifle ready for use .
" a buffalo ! "
cried darry .
" a buffalo ?
look out for yourselves . "
" yes , take care , " came from captain moore , who was behind the old scout .
" we 've fixed him , " said <name> , not without a good deal of pardonable pride .
" fixed him ? "
old benson looked out upon the glade .
" by the great <unk> ! "
he roared .
" gone and shot a buffalo all by your lone selves !
or maybe he was dead when you got here ? "
he added suspiciously .
" you would n't think he was dead , if you could have seen him come toward us , " said darry .
" but who shot him ?
i heard four shots . "
" and every one of 'em went into the buffalo , " answered <name> .
" two for darry and two for myself . "
" but <name> finished him , with a shot in the eye , " said darry quickly .
" but darry hit him in the leg , and that lamed him , " said <name> , just as quickly .
" i guess honors are even . "
" certainly remarkable shooting , " was captain moore 's comment .
" old hunters could n't do better , could they , benson ? "
" not much better , captain .
i never would have dreamed of it , boys .
and to think i could n't get a smell of 'em when i was out looking 'em up , " benson said , shaking his head dubiously .
" this buffalo was n't alone , " said darry .
" the others went in that direction .
you might follow them up . "
" it would n't be any use now , lad .
they are gone , and that 's the end of it . "
" we must n't lose too much time , " put in the young captain .
" i must make the fort to-night , no matter what comes . "
" but , <name> , we ca n't leave this magnificent buffalo behind , " pleaded his brother .
" darry and i <name> want the skin , and we 'll want to mount the head and horns , eh , darry ? "
" to be sure . "
" how long <name> it take to skin the beast , benson ? "
" an hour and over , if i want to make a good job of it , " was the slow reply .
" it 's too nice a hide to ruin by quick cutting . "
" supposing i ride ahead then , and you follow with the boys as soon as you are ready ? "
this was agreed to , and in a minute the young officer was off once more , urging his horse forward at the animal 's best speed .
" now i can take my time , " declared old benson .
" sorry i aint got my hunting-knife . "
" where is it ? "
" it was lost in the shuffle with those desperadoes i put in the hole . "
the old scout chuckled .
" my !
my !
how they must love me for putting 'em down there ! "
" they 'll have it in for you when they get out , " remarked darry .
" oh , i 'm not afraid , lad . "
the buffalo had fallen into something of a heap , and it took their combined efforts to turn the huge carcass over .
then old benson got out his <unk> , sharpened the blade upon the leather of his boot , and set to work , the boys assisting him as much as possible , which was not much , since the process was entirely new to them .
" that <name> be a load , " said <name> , when they had the skin and a part of the head free .
" how much do they weigh , benson ? "
" close on to a hundred pounds . "
" and how shall we <name> that load ? "
" we 'll tie it up into something of a long bundle and take turns at <unk> it behind our saddles .
of course we wo n't be able to move along as fast as before , but that wo n't be necessary , now the captain has gone ahead to break the news . "
the trail now led toward the river where darry had almost lost his life by being hit with the drifting tree .
the path was uncertain in spots , and they had to be careful for fear of getting into some <unk> hole .
" what a splendid place for a ranch home ! "
suggested darry .
" benson , i am surprised that there are so few cabins in this neighborhood . "
" there used to be quite a number through here , lad ; but the <unk> and other indians burnt them all down .
i suppose new settlers <name> come in , now the indians are behaving themselves . "
" but are they behaving themselves ? "
questioned <name> .
" they are doing a good deal better than formerly , <name> .
there is only one old chief in this neighborhood who seems to want to cause trouble . "
" and who is that ? "
" white ox .
he is some sort of a relative to sitting bull , so i 've been told , and he wo n't give in that the white man is master of the situation .
he has tried to get his warriors to rise against us several times , but so far he has n't accomplished much . "
" where is white ox now ? "
" over behind yonder mountain to the north .
he is chief of a band that <name> between a hundred and a hundred and fifty people .
he himself is one of the best indian shots in the west . "
" it 's a pity they ca n't become citizens as well as other folks , " remarked darry .
" that 's the whole trouble , lad .
the united states did n't treat them right in the first place , and we are bound to suffer in consequence .
but in the end the injun <name> be wiped out completely . "
as night came on , countless stars shone in the sky , making the trail fairly light .
old benson rode in advance , with darry next and <name> bringing up the rear .
presently the old <name> <name> rein , and motioned the others to do the same .
" somebody ahead , " he said in a low voice .
" four or five men on <unk> .
if i aint mistaken they 're injuns , too . "
" indians ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" do they come this way often ? "
" no , lad .
fact is , they have n't any right over here , so close to the fort .
it 's against colonel fairfield 's rules . "
" then what can they be doing here ? "
" that 's for us to find out . "
old benson led the way to a side trail , and then into the shelter of a number of trees .
he quickly passed the pelt over to darry .
" both of you stay here until i get back , " he said .
" i 'm going to find out what those redskins are up to . "
" you wo n't be gone long , <name> you ? "
asked <name> .
" do n't expect to be gone over an hour at the most .
if i aint back in two hours , make up your mind something has happened .
then you 'll have to get back to the fort the best way you can , " concluded the old scout .
a moment later the darkness of the night hid him from their view , and they were left alone in the bit of <unk> .
chapter xxi .
a trick of the enemy .
" i must say i do n't fancy this much , " observed <name> , after the sounds of benson 's departure had lost themselves in the distance .
" nor do i like it , <name> , " came from darry , with a long-drawn sigh .
" but i guess we 'll have to make the best of it . "
" with what was on that message my brother found in the cave , and what benson said about this indian chief , it looks as if the folks at the fort might have trouble in the near future . "
" that 's true , too .
i <name> <name> got through in safety . "
dismounting , the two boys sat down under the trees to wait in the darkness .
the horses were glad enough of the rest , and fell to cropping the short grass which showed itself in spots in the vicinity .
thus half an hour passed .
the silence was oppressive , broken only by the occasional note of a night bird or the dismal croaking of a frog in some hollow and the answering squeak of a lizard .
" somebody is coming ! "
cried <name> at last , and both of the boys stood on the defensive , rifles in hand .
the party came closer and closer , and at last they made out the form of the old scout .
he was riding at the top of his speed .
" quick !
follow me ! "
he exclaimed , as he dashed up .
" there is not a moment to lose ! "
the boys needed no second bidding , and in a trice they were in the saddle once more and riding after old benson , who now took to another trail leading somewhat to the south of that formerly pursued .
" you saw the indians ? "
questioned <name> , as they dashed on .
" i did .
white ox is ahead , with sixty or seventy of his best warriors .
from what i could learn he and lieutenant <name> have had a fight , and half a dozen of the soldiers were either killed or wounded .
now white ox is marching for the fort . "
" to attack it ? "
" i ca n't say about that , but i think he is going to hide in the vicinity , to wait for the coming of the desperadoes . "
" and what of my brother ? "
questioned <name> anxiously .
" did he get through all right ? "
" nothing was said about the captain , lad .
i suppose he got through . "
it was hard to talk while riding at such a rate of speed , and soon the conversation came to an end .
the horses now showed plain evidence of their long journey , but each rider kept his steed at his best .
it was after two o'clock in the morning when the fort came into view , dark and silent in the midst of the plain surrounding it .
benson now rode in advance .
" halt ! "
came the sudden command , while the scout was still a hundred yards from the stockade .
the command was loud and clear , but the speaker was invisible .
" it 's all right , friend , " answered the old scout .
" it 's me , <name> benson .
let me in , quick , i 've news for the colonel . "
" all right , benson , " was the answer .
" but who is that behind you ? "
" <name> moore and darry germain .
is the colonel sleeping ? "
" the colonel is very sick . "
" sick ? "
" yes . "
" what 's the trouble ? "
" the surgeon ca n't make out exactly .
he 's in a sort of stupor , and they ca n't rouse him . "
by this time the stockade gate was open , and all three of our friends lost no time in entering the yard .
then the gate was closed and barred again .
" has captain moore returned ? "
asked <name> , as soon as he could get the guard 's attention .
" i have n't seen him . "
" how long have you been on duty ? "
" came on about an hour ago . "
" has lieutenant <name> come in ? "
came from benson .
" not that i know of ; reckon not , " answered the guard .
" worse and worse ! "
groaned the old scout .
" who is in command here ? "
" captain <name> .
but he 's about half sick , too . "
" it 's a trick of the enemy ! "
cried darry .
" a trick ? "
queried the guard with interest .
" yes , a trick , " put in <name> .
" benson , had n't they better sound the alarm ? "
" yes , and i 'll interview captain <name> . "
no more was said , and , while the sentinel called the corporal of the guard , the old scout hurried off to find the captain in command .
with him went <name> and darry .
<name> 's heart was like a lump of lead , for he was much concerned over the <unk> of his brother .
had the captain met the indians and been killed or taken prisoner ?
captain <name> was in a sound sleep , but quickly roused up when told that an important message awaited him .
he met the party in one of the living rooms of the fort .
his head was tied up in a wet towel , and his eyes showed that he was suffering .
" this is certainly a <unk> plot , " he said , when all had told their story .
" the desperadoes and indians intend to combine in an attack on the fort .
<name> is undoubtedly that wily old half-breed who is still alive and who is very thick with white ox .
but i did n't know he could write . "
" but what about this money at the fort ? "
asked <name> .
" the money is here , in a chest that is hidden away .
it amounts to forty thousand dollars in gold , and is the property of the <unk> mining company .
it was left for <unk> until mr. <unk> could have it transported to <name> .
you see , <unk> is a brother-in-law to colonel fairfield . "
" the colonel must be drugged , " said benson .
" that 's the reason he acts so queerly . "
" i suppose so , and that is what has affected me , i presume , " answered captain <name> .
" last night my head ached as if it would split open .
we must tell the surgeon of this .
perhaps he can then do something to relieve colonel fairfield . "
the captain lost no time in issuing the necessary orders , and in a few minutes the whole place was in alarm and the soldiers were on the watch for the first appearance of the indians .
" my poor husband drugged ! "
cried mrs. fairfield , when she heard the news .
" what villains those indians and desperadoes are !
doctor , can you do nothing ? "
" i think i can , madam , " answered the surgeon .
" much depends upon what drugs were administered and how much the colonel has taken .
rest assured i <name> do my best for him . "
upon examination it was found that out of all the officers at the fort only four were fit for duty , all the others being sick , either through being drugged or otherwise .
of the privates not more than sixty-five were in a condition to fight should an attack come .
" and the worst of it is , the men wo n't know what to eat or drink after this , " said captain <name> to benson .
" who can tell what has been drugged ?
perhaps it 's in the very bread we eat and the water we drink . "
strict orders were given to the men to touch nothing until the surgeon had passed upon it .
then the doctor got out his medicines to counteract the drugs , and set to work to bring the colonel and the other sufferers out of their stupor .
hour after hour went slowly by , and still captain moore did not return .
what had become of his brother , <name> could not imagine .
he feared the worst , and when morning came it was all he could do to keep back the tears .
" do n't take it so to heart , <name> , " said darry sympathetically .
" it may be all right . "
" but he said he was going to ride straight here  you heard him , darry . "
" so i did , but he may have seen the indians or met lieutenant <name> , and that might have changed his plans .
anyway , i would n't worry too much just yet . "
with the coming of daylight captain <name> brought out his <unk> glass and swept the surroundings of the fort with extreme care .
" some camp-fires are burning to the northward , " he announced .
" any injuns ? "
questioned old benson laconically .
he had been told to come along to the top of the fort for consultation .
" nobody in sight , benson . "
" humph !
well , i do n't calculate they are far off . "
" nor i , from what you and the boys told me .
how long <name> it take those desperadoes to reach here ? "
" they ought to arrive this morning , if they are not with the injuns already . "
" all told , we have about seventy officers and men available for duty , " went on the captain thoughtfully .
" what is worse , they must know how greatly our garrison is reduced , since they have had that skunk of a <name> do the <unk> for them . "
" the injuns number over sixty , and if there are thirty desperadoes , that <name> give them a force of almost a hundred , or twice as many as we have , captain .
but then , we hold the fort .
they ca n't come anywhere near us without being cut down  if we set out to do it . "
" of course .
but white ox may send off for more indians  when he hears how small the available garrison is . "
" does he know much of affairs here ? "
" i am afraid he does .
there were two indians here yesterday , to lodge a complaint against a miner who had stolen a horse from them .
i think , now , that the complaint was a blind , and the indians were here merely to size up the situation , " concluded captain <name> .
chapter xxii .
in the hands of the enemy .
little dreaming of all the adventures in store for him , captain moore left the scene of the buffalo shooting and rode forth swiftly in the direction of fort <name> .
he felt that he carried news of great importance and the sooner he gained the fort the better .
should anything happen to colonel fairfield the command of the post would fall upon himself , as next in rank .
as he dashed along the trail , over hill and valley , he reviewed the situation with care , and the more he thought of it , the more worried did he become .
" something is going to happen  i can feel it in the air , " he muttered .
the thought had scarcely crossed his mind when something did happen , but not exactly what he anticipated .
a shadow fell across his path , and as he <name> rein he found himself confronted by several indians .
" white officer , stop ! "
cried the leader of the red men sternly .
" hullo !
what do you want ? "
demanded the captain .
the meeting was a complete surprise .
" want to have a talk . "
" who are you ? "
" me red wolf , belong to white ox tribe , " returned the indian with a scowl .
" and what are you doing out here at this time of night , red wolf ? "
" indians on a big hunt .
see buffalo yesterday . "
" yes , i saw one of the buffaloes myself . "
captain moore paused , not knowing how to go on .
" you are pretty close to the fort . "
" red wolf and warriors get on the wrong trail , " was the slow reply .
" but want to talk now .
come along . "
as the indian concluded he caught the captain 's steed by the bridle .
" let go the horse . "
" want to talk to white officer . "
" you have n't any right to touch my horse . "
hardly had the words been spoken when two indians rushed up behind the captain and dragged him to the ground .
the fellows were large and powerful , and they disarmed him before he could even fire a shot .
without further ado captain moore was forced to march along , between two of the red men , while a third led his horse .
a route around the rocks was taken , and presently they came to a dense bit of <unk> .
in the midst of this was a clearing , and here was the camp of some ten or a dozen indians .
the indians at hand were a guard over several white soldiers , and to his intense surprise the young captain recognized some of lieutenant <name> 's men .
" what are you doing here ? "
he asked .
" had a mix-up and came off second best   " began one of the soldiers , when an indian guard clapped a dirty hand over his mouth and ordered him to be silent , under penalty of death .
then the captain was taken to another part of the glade , and here he was made a close prisoner by being bound , hands and feet , to the trunk of a blasted tree .
red wolf wished to know what the captain had been doing away from the fort .
" i 've been on a hunting expedition . "
" alone ? "
" no . "
" where are the others ? "
" safe , by this time .
what do you intend to do with me , red wolf ? "
" white ox shall decide that , " grunted the red man .
" then he is on this hunt , too ? "
" he is . "
" when <name> he be here ? "
" soon . "
" do n't you know that i am an army officer , and that you are laying up a good deal of trouble for yourself by making me a prisoner ? "
" the white man has not treated the indians right . "
" this is no way to redress wrongs , red wolf .
why do n't you go to colonel fairfield and make a complaint ?
he <name> send the story to the great father at washington . "
" the great father <name> not listen .
we have sent many complaints  as the white captain knows . "
" he <name> listen  if the complaint is a just one .
the trouble is , the indians <name> not obey colonel fairfield 's orders . "
" and why should they obey the white man ?
is not white ox their chief ? "
" that is true .
but the land is now the white man 's , and the indians must obey the great father at washington , or in the end it <name> go hard with them . "
" not so ! "
cried red wolf savagely .
" in the end the white man <name> be driven eastward , where he belongs .
no one shall rule in these mountains but the red man .
white ox and the other great chiefs have spoken . "
" what !
you are going on the warpath ? "
" the hatchet may be dug up , if the white man <name> not listen to the red man . "
" i know what the trouble is , red wolf .
<name> gilroy and that <unk> half-breed , <name> , have set you up to this .
they have filled your ears with false stories about our cruelty and about much money at the fort . "
by the look on the indian 's face the young officer saw that he had struck the truth , at least in part .
but the red man would talk no more , fearing he had already said too much , and he stalked off , warning a guard to be careful and not let the captain escape .
when left to himself , captain moore 's reflections were very bitter .
" if the redskins are out in force they 'll probably fall in with benson and the boys , " he told himself .
" and if they do there <name> surely be trouble .
benson wo n't allow them to take him alive , and that <name> mean a good deal of shooting all around . "
he listened attentively for shots in the distance , but none came , and this caused him to be more perplexed than ever .
just before daybreak several additional indians came in , and the young officer and the soldiers were told to march .
their feet were unfastened , but their hands were not , and they were forced to move with the red men on all sides of them , and each of the enemy fully armed and ready to shoot them down at the first show of resistance or escape .
from one of the privates captain moore learned that lieutenant <name> and the other soldiers had escaped , but what had become of them nobody knew .
the little body of whites and indians marched over a mountain trail for fully four hours .
the step was a lively one , and when the party came to a halt even the soldiers used to a hard march were tired out .
" those redskins can walk the legs off of anything i know of , " was the way one old soldier expressed himself .
" they are like some of these wiry mustangs who do n't know the meaning of rest . "
" this region is strange to me , peck .
do you recognize it ? "
" i do , captain moore .
yonder is <unk> fall , and this trail leads to silver gulch . "
" then we are about six miles from nowhere in particular . "
" you 've struck it , captain .
why they brought us to such a forsaken spot is more than i can guess  unless they are going to shoot us down like dogs and leave us for the wolves to feed on .
the wolves are thick around here , so leeson told me . "
" i do n't believe they 'll shoot us down .
they are not desperate enough yet .
but they may do it , if they attack the fort and lose heavily .
that <name> open their eyes , and make them as mad as hornets . "
a little later silver gulch , a wide opening in the rocks of the mountain , was gained , and here the soldiers were again made fast to several trees .
then the indians prepared their midday meal .
they took their time about eating , and did not offer the white men anything until they had finished .
" they do n't intend to treat us any too good , " was peck 's comment .
" captain , ca n't we fix it to get away ? "
" i intend to escape if i can manage it , " returned the young officer .
" but we must be careful , for they are fully armed , and they watch us like so many foxes . "
slowly the afternoon wore away , and with the coming of night it grew darker than usual , as though a storm was brewing .
" a storm ought to help us , " said the captain .
some of the indians had departed , so that now the guard consisted of but four warriors .
these red men walked around each prisoner , seeing to it that all the bonds were tight .
as the men passed peck the old soldier watched his chance , and , unknown to the red men , caught a hunting-knife from the belt of one of the number .
this knife was concealed up his sleeve , and then the soldier waited for his chance to use the blade , which was as sharp as a razor .
the indians decided that two of their number should sleep , while the other two remained on guard .
soon those to retire turned in , while the others sat down to smoke their pipes .
this was peck 's opportunity , and with a slash of the hunting-knife he released his hands .
a moment later the lariat around his ankles was likewise severed .
watching his chance , peck passed the knife to captain moore , and then went back to his position by the tree as if still fastened .
thus the knife was passed from soldier to soldier until all were liberated .
all told , the party numbered six , and nobody was armed , excepting peck , to whom the hunting-knife had been returned .
motioning to the others to keep quiet , captain moore picked up a stick of wood lying near and threw it in some bushes a distance away .
this made considerable noise , and instantly the two guards gazed in the direction .
" a wolf , perhaps , " said one of the indians , in his native tongue , and walked over to the bushes .
his companion started to follow , when captain moore leaped upon him and bore him to the earth .
chapter xxiii .
a panther in camp .
as captain moore fell upon one of the indians , peck the private stole after the guard who had walked toward the bushes .
the other soldiers jumped to where the remaining indians were sleeping , to gain possession of the firearms .
the indian the captain had tackled was a young but powerful brave , and he put up a hard fight to release himself .
but he had been taken unawares , and after he was on the ground the captain saw to it that he did not get up .
in the meantime the indian near the bushes turned just in time to see peck raise the hunting-knife .
crack !
went the red man 's rifle , and the bullet clipped the soldier 's ear .
the shot was so close that to the day of his death peck carried in his face some traces of the burnt powder .
the shot was the last the indian ever fired , for in the midst of the smoke peck hurled himself at the warrior , and a second later down came the hunting-knife , piercing the red man 's back and entering his right lung .
the stroke was a fatal one , and before the fighting in the glade came to an end the indian had breathed his last .
when the sleeping indians awoke they could not for the moment realize what was going on .
in his bewilderment one leaped up and rushed at a soldier , who promptly laid him low by a heavy blow from a rifle stock , which almost cracked the warrior 's skull .
seeing this , the other brave became frightened and ran for the bushes .
" do n't let him escape ! "
cried captain moore , who was still holding his man down .
at once two of the soldiers ran after the fleeing indian , and presently two rifle shots rang out , followed by a scream from the red man .
" he 's done for , " said one of the soldiers , after the smoke had cleared away .
" he has gone to his happy <unk> . "
after this turn of affairs it did not take the soldiers long to make prisoners of the two indians who remained alive .
these fellows were in truth much frightened , but tried their best to suppress their feelings .
from one of the indians , captain moore learned that more indians were expected early the next morning .
" that 's all right , " said he .
" they <name> come in time to release you and save you from starvation . "
" going to tie 'em up , captain ? "
asked peck .
" yes .
there is nothing else to do . "
" better shoot 'em . "
" i ca n't shoot them in cold blood , peck .
that would not be human . "
" the wretches do n't deserve to live , captain .
the indians and those desperadoes are plotting to wipe out everybody left at the fort . "
" i know that .
still , i can not bring myself to take their lives  and we ca n't stop to take them along as prisoners .
the sooner we get back to the fort the better . "
" if we can get back , " put in another soldier .
" i do n't believe the fort is surrounded just yet , " returned the young officer .
" but if it is ? "
" then , perhaps , it <name> be better for us to be out than in . "
" you would n't desert the crowd at the fort , would you ? "
" you know me better than that , <unk> .
we might be able to ride to the next fort and obtain re-enforcements . "
" that 's so , captain !
i did n't think of that . "
leaving the dead indians in the bushes and the others tied to the trees , the captain and his companions now lost no time in striking out for the fort .
fortunately , peck was well acquainted with every foot of the territory to be covered , and he led the way by a route which was fairly easy and as direct as could be expected , considering the wild region to be covered .
as he hurried along , the young captain 's thoughts were busy .
where were <name> , darry , and benson , and how were things going at the fort ?
" the indians are not so much to be blamed as the desperadoes , " he said .
" they have some wrongs , although they are more fancied than real .
but the desperadoes ought all to be either shot down or placed under arrest . "
" right you are , " returned <unk> .
" this district <name> never prosper until the desperadoes are cleaned out . "
it was not long before the party began to grow hungry , and they had to halt for an hour , to prepare some birds which one of the number had brought down with a gun .
all the time they were eating , one of the soldiers remained on guard , for they were fearful a band of indians might come up unawares to surprise them .
but not a red man or desperado showed himself .
nightfall found them still sixteen miles from the fort , and unable to walk further .
" we <name> camp out where we are , " said captain moore .
" it is useless to think of covering the distance in the dark .
besides , we might fall into some trap . "
a storm had been threatening , but now the clouds passed and the night proved clear and pleasant .
it was decided that two men should remain on guard at a time , each taking a turn of three hours .
the young captain slept from nine o'clock until three in the morning .
then he awoke with the feeling that further sleep was out of the question .
getting up , he walked to a nearby <name> , intending to wash up and obtain a needed drink .
while captain moore was in the vicinity of the <name> something stirring in the bushes attracted his attention .
" carwell , did you see that ? "
he asked , of the guard who was nearest to him .
" see what , captain ? "
" that thing in yonder bushes . "
" i see nothing , sir . "
" something is moving there .
come here and look . "
the private did as commanded , and both gazed steadily into the bushes .
" by jove ! "
exclaimed the young officer at length , " do you see what it is now , carwell ? "
" i do not , captain . "
" it 's a panther , unless i am greatly mistaken . "
" where ? "
" lying on the fallen tree , behind that tall bush , " and captain moore pointed with his hand .
as he did this the panther arose suddenly , then crouched down as if to make a leap at them .
" shoot ! "
ordered the captain , and as quickly as the private could raise his rifle he fired .
but his aim was poor , and the bullet flew a foot over the panther 's head .
" missed , <name> the luck ! "
muttered carwell .
scarcely had the words left his lips , when the panther made a fierce leap and landed directly at the feet of the astonished pair .
the beast was evidently very hungry , or it would not have attacked human beings in this <unk> of the early <name> .
full of fear , carwell staggered back , with his smoking rifle still in his hand .
the panther growled and switched its tail from side to side .
the rifle shot had filled it with wonder , and it did not know what to do next .
" be careful  he is going to take another leap ! "
cried the young captain .
he was right ; the panther was now preparing for another spring .
before carwell could get out of the way , the beast came on , pinning the private to the earth .
as carwell went down the whole camp roused up , and the second guard came up on the double quick .
" what 's up , captain ? "
he sang out .
" shoot the panther ! "
answered the young officer .
" quick , or you 'll be too late .
do n't hit carwell . "
crack !
the rifle spoke up , and the beast was hit fairly and squarely in the side .
at this it let out a blood-curdling scream of pain .
it had caught carwell by the arm , but now it released its hold .
" a panther ! "
roared one of the old soldiers .
" and a big one .
git your guns , boys !
he aint no beast to fool with , i can tell you that ! "
those who had guns ran for them .
but in the meantime the panther turned around , as if to retreat .
then , of a sudden , it seemed to catch sight of captain moore , and with a snarl of rage it threw itself upon the young officer , and both went over with a loud splash into the <name> .
chapter xxiv .
the skirmish in the brush .
up to the time the panther had turned upon him , the young officer had thought but little of his own safety , being concerned chiefly about carwell , who was flat on his back , and who looked as if he as going to be chewed up by this wild , <name> , and hungry beast of the forest .
but now captain moore found himself attacked , and as he went over into the <name> he realized that he was in the most perilous position he had yet encountered .
facing indians and desperadoes was nothing compared to facing this beast , that seemed bent upon his destruction .
the spot where the young officer struck the <name> was five or six feet deep , and as the panther came down on top of him he went straight to the bottom .
the beast was also submerged , but not for long .
<unk> , although they can swim , do not like the water , and this one lost no time in coming to the surface to get air .
then it let out another scream of pain , while the bullet wound in its side dyed the <name> red .
as the panther came up the young captain tried to do the same .
but the first thing he encountered was the beast 's fierce claws , and he received a deep and painful scratch in his left shoulder .
then he went down again , and tried to come up further down the stream .
but unfortunately the panther moved in the same direction .
in the meantime the other soldiers came up to the edge of the <name> .
they realized their captain 's peril , and as soon as the panther showed itself two of them blazed away , one hitting the beast in the back and the other landing a bullet in the panther 's neck .
the fury of the animal was now intense , and whirling around it lashed the water of the <name> into a perfect foam .
then it leaped for the opposite shore , and made a break for the underbrush .
before anybody could fire again it was gone .
when captain moore regained the surface of the <name> willing hands helped him out .
" hurt ? "
questioned peck anxiously .
" a little  on the shoulder , " was the answer , with a gasp .
" where is the beast ? "
" got away in yonder bushes , sir .
that 's a nasty dig .
you had better let me bind it up . "
" carwell , how are you ? "
" the beast nipped me in the arm , " answered the private , trying to suppress a groan .
" by <name> , but he was an ugly one ! "
" that 's right , " put in another soldier .
" you can be thankful you wasn't chewed up . "
a brief search revealed the fact that the panther had left the vicinity , and then the others set to work to bind up the wounds the captain and carwell had sustained .
" we had better move on now , " said the young officer , when the hurts had been attended to .
" if there are indians or desperadoes around they must certainly have heard those shots , and they <name> be wondering what they mean . "
they marched on in the gloom , and did not halt until the sun was showing itself over the hills to the eastward .
they had now gained a rise of ground from which with a <unk> the fort might have been seen .
but the young captain 's glass was gone  confiscated , as already told , by those who had first attacked him .
" we <name> draw closer with caution , " said the young officer .
" we don't want to walk into any trap . "
less than a mile was covered , when peck , who had been sent out in advance , came back and called for silence .
" some indians are ahead , " he said .
" how many of them ? "
questioned captain moore .
" not less than a dozen or fifteen , captain .
i counted eleven , and heard some talking that i could n't see . "
" where are they ? "
" down behind where the <name> flows over those <unk> rocks .
we were out there fishing last summer . "
" i know the spot you mean .
what are the redskins doing ? "
" nothing in particular .
i overheard one say to another that he expected white ox along before sundown . "
" they must be an advance guard of the tribe , then , " returned the young officer thoughtfully .
" did any of them see you ? "
" i do n't think they did . "
but in this peck was mistaken , for scarcely had the soldiers started to walk around the spot where the indians were encamped , when a savage war-whoop rang out , followed by half a dozen shots .
the first round was a deadly one , killing two of the men and wounding peck in the side .
a bullet likewise grazed captain moore 's shoulder .
" to cover ! "
shouted the young officer , as soon as he could speak .
" the indians are on us ! "
he had a gun in his hand , and as he gave the command he leveled it at the leader of the party , he who had killed one of the soldiers .
captain moore 's aim was true , and the indian fell lifeless over the very body of the man he had slain .
by this time the other indians were coming up , and all the soldiers could do was to take to the nearest cover , as the captain had ordered .
the <unk> continued , and shots were fired from several directions .
scarcely knowing whether he was hit or not , captain moore dashed into the midst of some brushwood , and not far away from him came peck .
the latter had broken his rifle over the head of one of the red men , and now advanced with the hunting-knife which was still in his possession .
the young captain held a rifle , but just now had no time in which to reload the weapon .
" they are after us <unk> ! "
cried peck , after several hundred feet had been covered .
the private 's breath came short and sharp , and now for the first captain moore saw how he was suffering .
" you are wounded , peck . "
" that 's right , captain . "
" you ca n't run any more . "
" i 've got to run , " muttered peck , between his set teeth .
" they 'll be on  oh !  on us in another minute . "
" give me your arm  i 'll help you along . "
the private held out his hand , then gave a pitch , and , before the young officer could catch him , sank on the grass insensible .
captain moore 's heart leaped into his throat , for he had known peck for years , and the two were very friendly .
he listened , and heard a distant shot .
evidently the indians were not yet coming in that direction .
they would first hunt down the others , providing they were not already slain .
bending down , the young officer took peck in his strong arms and threw the private over his shoulder .
the weight was considerable , and made him stagger .
" i 've got to <name> him , somehow ! "
he muttered .
" heaven give me strength to do it ! "
the brushwood was thick ahead , but there was a sort of trail , made by wild animals , and he pursued this until he came to a <name> .
then to keep the indians from following them , should they come in that direction , he followed the <name> for a hundred yards or more .
at last he reached a point where the banks of the <name> were <name> , and here he came out , and crawled over the rocks .
not far off was an opening between two large <unk> , and here he sank down , too exhausted to take another step .
it was half an hour before peck came to his senses .
in the meantime the captain had obtained some water , washed the private 's wound and bound it up in bandages torn from his shirt .
the loss of blood had made peck <unk> .
" keep them off ! "
he murmured .
" keep them off !
they want to bore a hole in my side .
keep them off ! "
" be quiet , peck , you are safe , " answered the young captain soothingly .
" you 've been wounded , that 's the trouble , " but the private continued to rave for some time , when he relaxed into a stupor .
with strained ears captain moore waited for the appearance of friends or enemies , but nobody came up the <name> .
once he heard two shots far to the northward , but whether fired by the soldiers or the indians he could not tell .
" i 'm afraid it 's been a regular slaughter , " he mused sadly .
" and our getting away was a miracle , " and this surmise proved correct , for , as was afterward proven , all the others of the party were slain within an hour after the surprise occurred .
chapter xxv .
a lucky meeting .
" captain , where am i ? "
" in the woods with me , peck . "
" what has happened ? "
" do n't you remember ?
the indians surprised us , and you were shot in the side . "
the brow of the wounded soldier contracted for a moment , and then he <name> a long and painful breath .
" ah , yes , i remember now .
are we alone ? "
" yes . "
" and what of the others , captain ? "
" i am afraid they have either been shot down or taken prisoners .
poor carwell and leeds i know are dead . "
" it was a nasty surprise , was n't it ?
i was sure they had n't seen me . "
" those indians are sly , peck .
they never let on until they are fully ready .
we can be thankful that we escaped . "
" how long have we been here ? "
" the best part of the day .
i carried you along the <name> and to here , and i have n't dared to go any further .
those indians ca n't be far off . "
" it was good of you to do that for me , captain , " said the private gratefully .
" i know you would have done as much for me , peck .
what i am worried about is what we are to do next . "
" perhaps you had better wait till dark , and then sneak to the fort . "
" how do you feel ? "
" weak , captain , weak as a rag . "
" i <name> n't leave you , peck . "
" but you ought to try to save yourself . "
" we can both try to do that , when you are stronger . "
slowly the day wore along until night was once more on the pair .
peck had tried to stand up , but the effort had proved a dismal failure .
" it 's no use , " he murmured .
" i reckon i 'm a fit subject for the hospital , " and he gave a sickly grin .
the night was one captain moore never forgot .
he was hungry , but there was nothing at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of the inner man .
peck 's mind began to ramble again , and once he struggled violently , thinking he was fighting with an indian , who was trying to tear out his side .
with the coming of <name> the young officer felt that matters were growing desperate and that he must do something .
he determined to go on a short exploring tour , leaving the soldier where he lay .
" i 'll be back inside of half an hour , " he said .
" make yourself as comfortable as possible while i am gone . "
" do n't desert me ! "
groaned peck .
" promise to come back , captain  promise ! "
he pleaded , and the young officer promised .
on the opposite side of the <name> was a series of rocks leading to the top of rather a high hill , and captain moore had an idea that from this eminence he could obtain a faint view of the fort and its surroundings .
half of the rocks were passed when he came to a sudden halt .
a low groan ahead had reached his ears .
as he stopped and listened the groan was repeated .
" that sounds familiar , " he thought .
" i 've heard that before .
but where ? "
at last he made up his mind that the sounds came from some wild animal that was wounded , and plucking up courage he moved forward again , but with his rifle before him , ready to shoot at the slightest provocation .
" the panther  and dying ! "
the young officer was right .
there on a shelf of rocks lay the wounded beast , its breath coming short and heavy , and its eyes letting out a glassy stare that caused the captain to shiver in spite of himself .
at the sight of a human being the panther tried to rise .
but the effort was too much for it , and it sank down , groaning with pain , in a pool of blood which had formed .
at first captain moore thought to finish by putting a bullet through its head , but then he remembered that ammunition was scarce and lowered his rifle .
" he 'll be dead by the time i get back , " he thought , and continued on his way up the mountain side .
at last the top was gained , and he looked around eagerly .
at first only the plain far below met his view , but presently he made out a spot which he knew must be the fort .
but all was in a blue haze , and no details could be distinguished .
having spent quarter of an hour on the mountain top he picked his way back to where he had left the panther .
the creature had now breathed its last , and lay stiffened out on the <name> ledge .
" i must have something to eat , and so must peck , " he said to himself .
" panther steaks may be tough , but they <name> be better than nothing .
i 'll go back for the hunting-knife and cut off as much meat as we 'll be likely to need for a couple of days . "
when he reached peck 's side he found the soldier sleeping quietly , and did not disturb him .
going back , he cut off a generous slice of the panther meat , leaving the rest to the wild beasts .
the captain hated to build a fire , fearing it would attract the attention of the enemy , but he did not wish to eat the meat raw , and presently , having no matches , shot his gun into the midst of some dry leaves .
by this means he soon had a blaze , which he fed with the driest wood he could find , thus avoiding a great cloud of smoke .
over the blaze he cooked the steak , which was soon done to a turn .
when peck awoke he felt stronger , and readily partook of the meal brought to him , washing down the meat with some water from the <name> .
" what do you calculate to do now , captain ? "
he asked .
" from the top of yonder hill i can see the fort in the distance , " answered the young officer .
" but how to get to it is a question .
it would be a hard enough journey as it is , without having to be on guard against indians and desperadoes . "
" better leave me here , and go it alone . "
" no , i <name> n't desert you , peck .
we 'll see the thing through together . "
" but the indians might come down on us . "
" we 've got to run that risk .
the question is , can you walk at all ? "
for reply peck got up on his feet .
at first he swayed around a little , but presently steadied himself .
" i 'm good for a little distance , captain , but i do n't reckon to go into any walking match just yet . "
" then we 'll go ahead .
as soon as you feel played out , do n't hesitate to say so . "
captain moore carried the rifle , hunting-knife , and what was left of the meat , and also insisted upon having the private <name> on his arm .
in this fashion two miles were covered by noon , when they came to a rest under the shade of a big tree .
peck was pale , and showed plainly that the exertion had done him no good .
" hardest walking i ever did , " he admitted , as he stretched himself at full length .
it was his <unk> alone that had kept him up .
" well , we are gaining , " said captain moore cheerfully .
" three miles more <name> see us through . "
" if the enemy do n't <unk> us in the meantime . "
" the indians are nowhere in sight . "
" they wo n't be showing themselves if they can help it .
they spring on us   hark ! "
peck broke off short , and both listened .
" somebody is coming this way ! "
whispered the young officer .
" come , we must get out of sight ! "
he took the wounded soldier by the hand , and with all speed the pair crept into some brushwood behind the big tree .
in the meantime the <unk> of the unknown party came closer .
as the man came into view , captain moore let out a shout which was full of <name> .
" <name> leeson !
how glad i am to see you ! "
the old <name> started around and <name> up his gun .
then the weapon dropped , and he ran forward .
" captain moore ! "
he ejaculated .
" <name> me ef i aint glad to set eyes on ye !
who is that with you ? "
" private peck of company b .
we 've had a fight with the indians , and a number of the soldiers were killed . "
" the injuns are on the warpath , along with the desperadoes under <name> gilroy , " returned leeson .
" i got the word from <name> benson early this mornin ' . "
" and where was benson ? "
" out among the hills , <unk> ' fer you . "
" and what of my brother , and my cousin ?
have you heard anything of them ? "
" they are safe at the fort . "
" thank heaven for that ! "
" i see <unk> both of ye wounded , " went on leeson , as he came closer .
" my wound is not much .
but peck 's is bad .
i hardly knew how i was going to get him to the fort .
are the indians or desperadoes around ? "
" they are , captain  but whar is jest now the conundrum .
captain <name>  he 's in command now  thinks there 's a big plot on foot ter wipe out the fort . "
" he is right .
but colonel fairfield  what of him ?
did they drug him ? "
" they did , captain .
but it 's queer you know of all this . "
" then <name> did n't tell you i was with him at the cave ? "
" i did n't have time to hear the whole story .
benson was coming out , and i came with him .
now , as you 're found , i reckon i had better go back with you , " went on <name> leeson .
" by all means , for we 'll have to take turns in supporting peck . "
a few minutes later the march for the fort was taken up .
it was a tedious journey , and there were times when the young captain felt as if it would never come to an end .
but at last they came within sight of the stockade and the big flag floating so proudly to the breeze , and then several came rushing out to meet them , and their <unk> , for the time being , came to an end .
chapter xxvi .
the enemies within the fort .
" oh , i 'm so glad to see you again , <name> ! "
was the greeting which <name> gave his brother .
" we were almost certain either the indians or desperadoes had fallen upon you and killed you . "
" well , we did have some hot work , " answered the young captain modestly .
" are you all right ? "
" i am . "
" and you , darry ? "
" i 'm first-class , " answered the cousin .
" but i can tell you , <name> , there is trouble ahead . "
" i know that , darry .
i must see colonel fairfield at once . "
" he is very ill .
the surgeon can do hardly anything for him .
he says he has not the right drugs to reach such a dose as the colonel has swallowed . "
" that 's too bad . "
by this time captain <name> was at hand , and the two officers exchanged reports .
nothing had been heard concerning lieutenant <name> .
the command of the fort now fell upon captain moore .
as soon as possible the young commander went in to see his superior .
he found colonel fairfield very weak and in no condition to talk upon military matters .
he took the young captain 's hand , and said feebly : " you must do your best , captain , do your best .
defend the place to the last . "
" i <name> , colonel fairfield , " answered the young officer .
" and i trust you recover soon . "
that day and the next passed without incident of a special nature .
sick and wounded were cared for by the surgeon , and a detachment went out , accompanied by <name> benson and <name> leeson , to look for any of the soldiers who had been attacked by the indians or desperadoes and who might still be alive .
when this party returned they brought in the bodies of two soldiers that had fallen .
" the indians are gathering in force , " said old benson , who had been right among them in the darkness .
" there are now over a hundred and twenty of them . "
" and what of the desperadoes ? "
asked captain moore .
" the desperadoes number twenty-six , " answered <name> leeson .
" i counted noses myself .
<name> gilroy is a reg'lar captain over 'em an ' has 'em drilled like a company o ' sharpshooters  an ' i reckon thet 's wot they are , <unk> 'em ! "
" then the enemy , all told , <name> about a hundred and fifty , " mused the young captain .
" how many men here fit for duty to-day , captain ? "
came from the old scout .
" not over forty , including the cooks and stable help , benson .
all the others are on the sick list  and some of them are pretty bad . "
" perhaps the crowd outside are <unk> ' till ye all git sick , " suggested leeson with a scowl .
" <unk> fair fightin ' , is it ?
they ought all to be <name> ! "
" i must do my best , " said captain moore gravely .
" i can do no more . "
as the day wore along and two additional soldiers were taken sick , he decided to send a messenger to fort prescott , a hundred and sixty miles away , for assistance .
<name> leeson knew every foot of the territory , and was chosen for the mission .
benson was more than willing to go , but captain moore told him to remain where he was .
" if the enemy attack us you 'll have to be our right-hand man , benson , " he said .
then he added : " i want to talk to you after leeson is gone . "
since coming to the fort captain moore had been watching two old soldiers very closely .
these soldiers were named <name> bicker and <name> drossdell .
their reputations were not of the best , and the black marks against them were numerous .
some time before , the young captain had heard that bicker came of a family of colorado desperadoes and that he had joined the army during a spasm of reformation .
the actions of the pair did not suit captain moore in the least , and that night he took it upon himself to watch them more closely than ever .
in the darkness he saw bicker make his way to the stable , and to that spot , a little later , drossdell followed .
" something is in the wind , and i 'm going to find out what it is , " he mused , and watching his opportunity he passed into the stable unobserved .
at first he could hear nothing but the movements of the horses , but presently came a low murmur from one corner of the loft .
cautiously the young officer climbed the ladder and stepped into the hay .
here he could hear the conversation between bicker and drossdell quite plainly .
" they never suspected the butter , " he heard bicker say .
" it tastes a little strong , but they would rather have it that way than have none , and the same way with the condensed milk . "
" when shall we give the signal to the boys ? "
came from drossdell .
" not yet .
there <name> be more of them sick by to-morrow night , " replied bicker .
more of the same sort of talk followed , until the young captain became fully convinced that bicker and drossdell were in league with the desperadoes , and that they had been using some drugs in the butter , milk , and other articles consumed at the fort , in order to make the soldiers sick .
as soon as he realized the importance of his discovery captain moore went below .
a corporal 's guard was called out and sent over to the stable , and when bicker and drossdell came below they were placed under arrest .
" what 's this for ? "
demanded bicker , putting on a bold front .
drossdell had nothing to say , and trembled so he could scarcely stand .
" you know well enough , bicker , " answered captain moore sternly .
" no , i do n't .
i have n't done anything wrong , captain . "
" march them to the <unk> , " was all the young commander said , and the two were promptly marched away .
as may be surmised , the moment the evildoers were alone each accused the other of having done something to bring on exposure .
captain moore knew his men well , and presently he sent for drossdell and interviewed the soldier in private .
" i am sorry to see you in such trouble as this , drossdell , " he said .
" i thought you were a better soldier . "
" i have n't done anything , captain . "
" it is useless for you to deny it .
do you know what my men would do to you and bicker if they learned the truth ?
they would rebel and <name> you on the spot  and you would deserve it , too . "
" oh , captain , for the love of heaven , do n't put us in the hands of the boys ! "
pleaded drossdell , turning a ghostly white .
" you and bicker plotted to get us all sick and then let the indians and gilroy 's gang in on us . "
" i  i   " " it is useless for you to deny it , for i heard your talk myself , and saw a letter written by bicker to gilroy . "
" bicker formed the plans ! "
cried drossdell , breaking down completely .
" he  he forced me to help him . "
" forced you ? "
" yes , captain , forced me .
i stood out a long while , but he  he   well , i might as well make a clean breast of it , sir .
he had me in his power , on account of something i did in <name> years ago .
he said he would expose me if i did n't help him . "
" this is the strict truth ? "
" yes , captain , and i <name> swear to it if you want me to , " answered the prisoner .
" you were going to signal the gang when all was in readiness for an attack , " went on captain moore .
" bicker was going to do that . "
" what was the signal to be ? "
" three white handkerchiefs stuck on the ends of a cross made of sticks six feet long .
he was going to show these at ten in the morning or four in the afternoon , from the southwest corner of the stockade , behind the mess hall . "
" and what was the signal to be if you wanted the enemy to hold off for a while ? "
" a red shirt if he wanted them to hold off for one day and a red and a blue shirt if they were to hold off for two days . "
" you are certain about these signals ?
remember , if you are telling a lie it <name> all come back on your own head . "
" i am telling the strict truth , " answered drossdell .
chapter xxvii .
signals and what followed .
the interview over , captain moore lost no time in summoning <name> leeson .
" you must depart for fort prescott without delay , " he said .
" i 'm ready now , captain , " replied the old <name> .
" you must ride night and day till you get there . "
" i 'll do thet too . "
" i have received important news .
at the longest our enemies <name> hold off two days .
i <name> try to make them hold off a day longer if i can .
that <name> give you three days .
i <name> write a letter to <name> <unk> at once . "
this was early in the morning , and inside of half an hour the letter was written and the old <name> was off , on the back of the <unk> and most enduring horse the fort possessed .
he went fully armed , for he knew that he carried his life in his hands .
as soon as leeson had gone the young captain summoned the surgeon and told that individual about the drugged butter and condensed milk .
dr. <name> was incredulous , but on an examination said that all were drugged .
a cat that had drunk of the diluted condensed milk was found in a stupor from which she could not be aroused .
" it 's awful , " said the surgeon .
a trustworthy cook was called in , and all the butter and condensed milk which were open , or which showed signs of having been tampered with , were thrown away .
this put the soldiers on short rations so far as these commodities went , but nobody complained .
some suspected bicker and drossdell , and there was talk of a demand on the captain to have the traitors shot , but it came to nothing .
" what does this mean ? "
asked <name> , when he caught his brother in a quiet spot .
in a few words the young captain explained .
" you and darry must say nothing , " he concluded .
" we <name> have our hands full as it is .
the indians are in this , but the <unk> was not done by <name> the half-breed . "
" when <name> you signal to the enemy ? "
asked darry .
" this afternoon at four .
that <name> give us at least two whole days  and a lot may happen in that time . "
" if only the surgeon can bring some of the men out of their stupor , " remarked <name> .
" he hopes to do so  now he knows more about the drugs used against them . "
" if you had n't caught bicker and drossdell what do you suppose would have happened ? "
questioned darry .
" more than likely every one of us would have been sick , " answered the young captain with a shudder .
" then the indians and the desperadoes could have walked in here without a struggle . "
" even if help does not come , you 'll fight them , wo n't you , <name> ? "
" to be sure  to the bitter end . "
" by the way , are you certain the ammunition has n't been tampered with ? "
came from <name> .
" i was thinking of that and was going to have an examination made when you stopped me , " said captain moore , and hurried on .
an examination showed that some of the powder on the place had been hidden .
drossdell said this was under the barn flooring , and his words proved true .
promptly at four o'clock captain moore appeared at the southwest corner of the stockade with a red shirt in one hand and a blue shirt in the other .
fortunately he was built like bicker , and donning a private 's hat and coat made him look a good deal like that individual from a distance .
slowly he waved the coats to and fro for five minutes .
then an answering signal came back from some brushwood on the top of a distant hill  the answer being similar to the signal itself , showing the message was seen and understood .
it is likely that the indians and desperadoes were much chagrined to think that they would have to hold off for two days , but if so they made no sign .
the next day proved unusually warm .
there was nothing for the boys to do in the fort , and they wandered around from place to place .
at drill but thirty-eight soldiers presented themselves , all the others being on the sick list .
" i must say i do n't feel very well myself , " remarked darry .
" i can hardly keep my eyes open . "
" gracious !
do n't say that you 're going to get sick too ! "
cried <name> .
" i wo n't get sick if i can help it , " replied darry .
" but i feel awfully queer . "
<name> did what he could for his cousin .
but , with the limited means at hand , this was not much , and by sundown darry was flat on his back , although the attack he sustained was not as severe as that of many around him .
" i feel as if i was in something of a dream , " he told <name> .
" that drug must have opium in it . "
" it 's something like opium  i heard the surgeon say so , " answered his cousin .
at night a strict watch was kept , and twice old benson went out to reconnoiter .
" the indians and desperadoes have surrounded us on all sides , " he announced .
" but it do n't look as if they meant to attack us just yet . "
with the coming of morning it began to rain , but this cleared away by noon , and then the sun boiled down as fiercely as ever .
the <name> spots within the stockade were suffocating , and the boys were glad enough to stay within the cool walls of the stone fort .
as far as he was able captain moore had prepared the place to resist an attack .
a weak spot in the stockade was strengthened and the cannon of the fort were put in the best possible condition .
the soldiers were told where to go in case of a sudden alarm , and were cautioned not to waste any ammunition , for the supply was limited .
thanks to the surgeon 's efforts colonel fairfield was now somewhat better .
yet he was too weak by far to get up or to manage affairs , so the command still remained in captain moore 's hands .
even captain <name> was now down , and it was a question whether he would live or die .
" you must do your best , captain moore , " said the colonel feebly .
" i know i can trust you .
you are brave , and your training has been a judicious one . "
early that night there came a sudden alarm , followed by two rifle shots in quick succession .
at once there was a commotion , and everybody sprang to his post .
" the indians and desperadoes must be coming ! "
cried <name> , and ran for the rifle with which he had been armed .
the cause of the alarm , however , was not from without , but from within .
bicker had forced his way out of the <unk> , and at the risk of breaking his neck had climbed to the roof of the barn and leaped over the stockade into the ditch outside .
a guard had seen the leap and had fired on the man , hitting him , it was thought , in the shoulder .
then a second guard had discharged his weapon , but by this time the fleeing prisoner had been swallowed up in the gathering darkness .
" he must not get away ! "
cried the young captain .
" if he does , they <name> attack us at once .
after him , benson , and you , too , <unk> and <unk> .
i <name> follow with some horses ! "
without delay the old scout climbed the stockade and scrambled over the ditch .
the others ran around to the gate , and soon several additional soldiers followed .
on second thought captain moore sent the horses out by a lieutenant , thinking it best that he remain where he was , that being primarily his post of duty .
" can we go ? "
asked <name> .
" no , <name> , stay where you are , " said his brother .
" if that rascal gets to his friends there <name> be work enough here , never fear . "
the pursuit of bicker lasted for over an hour , and brought on a smart skirmish between the men from the fort and the desperadoes , in which one person on each side was slightly wounded .
but the rascal managed to gain the enemy 's camp in safety , and then those from the fort came back as fast as possible to report .
" now the deception is up , " said captain moore , with a serious look .
" i would n't be surprised to see them attack us before morning . "
" right you are , captain , " replied old benson , " and my opinion is , that the desperadoes and indians <name> fight hard , when once they get going , " he concluded .
chapter xxviii .
the demands of the enemy .
it was an hour later , when the excitement had cooled down a little , that captain moore sent for benson again .
wondering what was to follow , the old scout hurried to the room in which the young commander was <unk> his business .
" i want a little talk with you in private , benson , " said the young officer .
" yes , captain . "
" i know you 've been wondering why i did n't send you to fort prescott instead of sending <name> leeson . "
" you had a right to do as you pleased , captain . "
" the truth of the matter is , benson , i wanted you here .
you brought <name> and darry to the fort , and those two boys need looking after .
we are going to have a fight , sooner or later .
we may win , and if we do , all right .
but if we do n't   " " you want me to stand by the boys to the last ? "
put in the old scout quickly .
" i do , benson ; and , no matter what comes , i want you to promise to do your level best to save them , and see them safe back to the east .
if the worst comes i am willing to die fighting , but <name> must get out of it somehow .
if he does n't it <name> break my mother 's heart .
and you must do as well by darry , for he is an only child . "
the eyes of the old scout and the young captain met .
then benson put out his hand , which captain moore quickly grasped .
" i understand , captain .
i 'll do my best , and if those lads do n't get away it <name> be because <name> benson aint alive to take 'em . "
" as you are not a soldier you have a right to leave the fort as quickly as you please , " went on the young captain .
" therefore , if you see the tide of battle turning against us , do n't wait , but get the boys away as speedily and as secretly as you can . "
" i <name> , captain ; but yourself   " " never mind me .
get the boys to a place of safety , and i know our family and darry 's family <name> reward you well . "
" i wo n't want any reward .
i took to the lads from the start , and i'll stand by 'em through thick and thin , " said old benson .
there was but little sleeping done in the fort that night .
the majority of the soldiers slept on their arms , expecting an alarm at any moment .
yet it did not come , and the sun rose on a scene of perfect peace and quiet .
but at eight o'clock a sentinel announced a horseman approaching , bearing a white flag .
" so they want to talk , eh ? "
said the young captain .
" all right , anything to gain time . "
the flag of truce was promptly answered , and as the horseman came closer many recognized <name> gilroy .
the young captain went out himself to meet the leader of the desperadoes .
" good-morning , captain moore , " began the desperado , with a regular military salute .
" what brings you ? "
demanded the captain abruptly .
" well , i thought we had best come to terms  that 's what brought me . "
" terms about what , gilroy ? "
" terms about surrendering the fort and all of its contents . "
" surrendering ?
to whom ? "
" you know well enough , captain moore .
it <name> be only a waste of time to beat about the bush .
our crowd and the indians now number over three hundred , and we are bound to get possession of the fort and all that is in it . "
" do you speak for the indians as well as for yourself ? "
" i do . "
" so far as i know the indians are not on the warpath , gilroy .
i must have a talk with one of their chiefs before i do anything . "
" you know they are on the warpath .
did n't you have a mix-up with them ? "
" there are always some indians who are ugly and willing to make trouble . "
" well , all the indians are standing in with us on this deal , " went on gilroy , his face darkening .
" and you have got to surrender or take the consequences . "
" what <name> the consequences be ? "
" if you wo n't surrender we 'll attack the fort immediately .
we know just how weak you are , and let me tell you that we have a dozen or more dynamite bombs on hand with which we can blow the fort <unk> if we wish . "
" what good <name> it do you to capture the fort ? "
" we know all about the money that is stored here , and we want every dollar of it . "
" and if we surrender ? "
" if you surrender you <name> be allowed to march from the place unmolested , taking all of your sick with you , or leaving them here , in care of a doctor , if you prefer .
if you know where your head is level you <name> surrender , " went on the desperado earnestly .
" but if i am compelled to surrender , do n't you know that our army <name> be after you , gilroy ? "
" never mind , we 'll take care of that part of it , " was the answer , with a sickly grin .
" then you agree to surrender ? "
" i ca n't do it until i have spoken with one of the leading indian chiefs . "
at this the desperado 's face fell .
" <name> white ox do ? "
he asked , after an awkward pause .
" yes . "
" all right ; i 'll bring him along in about half an hour . "
this ended the interview , and turning his horse <name> gilroy rode off and captain moore walked back to the fort .
" a little time gained , at least , " was the young officer 's comment .
it was fully an hour before gilroy reappeared , accompanied by white ox and an <unk> known as little wildcat .
" want to talk , " grunted white ox , coming to a halt at a safe distance .
" have you dug up the hatchet , white ox ? "
demanded the captain .
" if not , let us smoke the pipe of peace together . "
" the pipe of peace is broken , " answered the old indian .
" the white man is not the red man 's friend .
he makes promises only to break them .
the indian must fight for what is his own . "
" do you consider this fort your own ? "
" the land is the red man 's  the white man has stolen it from him .
the white man must go and leave the red man to his own . "
" if you want the white man to go why do n't you drive gilroy and his gang away too ? "
" they have promised to leave  after they have had their share of what is here . "
" oh , so that 's the bargain ! "
" you see how matters stand , captain moore , " broke in the leader of the desperadoes .
" if you know when you are well off , you 'll submit as gracefully as possible . "
" if we leave <name> you promise to let all go in peace , " went on the young captain to the indian chief , " you <name> not molest the women or any of the young people ? "
" yes , all the women and young people can go , " said white ox , but the look in his face was not one to be trusted .
" and if we refuse when do you expect to attack us ? "
" at once . "
the reply came from <name> gilroy , and white ox nodded in the affirmative .
" i must consult colonel fairfield first , " said the captain slowly , wondering how he was to gain more time .
" i thought you were in command , " remarked gilroy .
" i was  but the colonel is getting better .
meet me here in another hour , and i <name> give you his reply and my own . "
this did not suit gilroy and white ox , but the captain was firm , and at last they went off , promising to be back exactly at the end of the hour .
" and then it must be surrender or fight , " said the leader of the desperadoes sharply .
" no more <unk> . "
it must be confessed that captain moore returned to the fort in a thoughtful mood .
he had an awful responsibility upon his shoulders .
he called several of the other officers in consultation .
" for myself , i believe in fighting , " he said .
" but we must consider those who are sick and must consider the women . "
" the colonel 's wife wishes us to fight to the end , " replied another officer .
" she is not willing to trust white ox or any of the other redskins . "
" i do n't believe in surrendering , " put in another .
" let us see if we ca n't hold off until we hear from leeson and fort prescott . "
and so it was arranged .
chapter xxix .
opening of the battle .
promptly on the minute gilroy and white ox appeared again , with the white flag of truce flying between them .
this time captain moore took with him one of his lieutenants , bacon by name .
the interview was shorter than the captain had anticipated .
" well , is it surrender or not ? "
asked <name> gilroy .
" we must have more time , " answered captain moore .
" can not you wait until to-morrow morning ? "
" not another minute , " was the angry reply .
" is it surrender or not ?
answer yes or no . "
" we <name> not surrender  at least not yet , " came from the young captain firmly .
" then your time is up , and we shall attack at once , " returned the leader of the desperadoes .
" am i not right , white ox ? "
" you have spoken truly , " came from the indian chief .
" soon the blood of the white soldiers <name> flow freely . "
without another word white ox galloped away , and <name> gilroy went after him .
" we are up against a battle now ! "
exclaimed lieutenant bacon .
" i have done my best to delay the contest  i can do no more , " said captain moore .
when he returned inside of the stockade he was immediately surrounded .
" boys , we must fight , " he said in a loud , clear voice .
" they <name> wait no longer .
but re-enforcements must be on the way by this time .
can i depend upon your standing by me ? "
" yes !
yes ! "
was the cry .
" we know how to do our duty to uncle <name> and the flag ! "
" let the desperadoes and the indians come on !
we 'll give them as hot a reception as they ever got ! "
while the soldiers were taking their way to the several defenses of the fort there was the beating of indian drums at a distance , followed by the blowing of a bugle in the camp of the desperadoes .
soon the beating and blowing came from half a dozen directions .
" they are gathering , sure enough ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" i wonder how long it <name> be before they fire the first shot ? "
" they 'll not be rash  be sure of that , " answered darry .
" they must know that the fort is a strong place . "
a little later one of the guards announced that bodies of indians were marching from the south of the fort to the westward .
here there was a fringe of trees at a distance of not over a hundred yards from the stockade .
colonel fairfield had often thought to have the belt of <unk> cut down , but had never put the plan into execution .
" they mean to get as close as possible before they expose themselves , " said the captain .
" <unk> , have the <unk> trained on that spot . "
" i <name> , captain moore , " said the head gunner , and saluted .
quarter of an hour went by , and the drumming and bugle calling had ceased .
suddenly a shout went up from behind the belt of <unk> , and a small cannon spoke up , sending a shell into the ditch outside the stockade .
" hullo , they have a cannon after all , " thought captain moore .
he called <unk> to him .
" can you get the range of that piece ? "
he asked .
" i can try , sir . "
" then do it , and if you can <unk> the piece so much the better . "
at once the head gunner ran off and sighted one of the cannon of the fort with care .
a few seconds later the cannon spoke up with a report that rang in the boys ' ears for long after .
the ball sped straight into the <unk> and cut down a heavy sapling growing beside the piece the enemy were reloading .
one desperado was killed instantly and another badly injured .
" a fair shot ! "
said the young captain .
" try it again , " but before <unk> could do so the cannon was withdrawn from sight .
after this came another lull , as if desperadoes and indians were considering what to do next .
" it 's a wonder they do n't make a rush , " said <name> , " if they have so many in their command . "
" nobody cares to risk an advance in the open , <name> , " said old benson .
" more than likely they wo n't try to do much until dark . "
again the indian drums were rolling , coupled with shrill <unk> .
then , with a wild yelling and a brandishing of rifles , about a hundred and fifty red men burst from cover and ran toward the stockade .
" they are coming ! "
was the cry .
" stand firm , men , do n't waste your ammunition ! "
captain moore cried .
he turned to the gunner .
" let them have it , <unk> ! "
bang !
the cannon boomed out again , and the shot tore through the advancing horde of indians , laying four of them low .
then came a volley from the red men , followed by the discharge of the piece in the hands of the desperadoes .
the splinters flew in several directions around the stockade and one soldier was seriously wounded .
the cannon ball grazed the flagstaff , and presently it was seen to totter .
" look out ! "
roared old benson to <name> , and as he spoke down came the stars and stripes on the heads of <name> and darry , and a section of the flagstaff with it .
" the flag is down ! "
a score of voices took up the cry , and a yell of triumph came from the indians and desperadoes .
" it 's not going to remain down ! "
cried old benson , and began to climb what remained of the pole .
he carried the <unk> with him , and soon , with the aid of the two boys , he had the glorious stars and stripes once more in position .
in the meantime the soldiers under captain moore were busy .
the indians were now at the ditch , and one had advanced as far as the stockade itself .
they were yelling like demons , and now the desperadoes began to show themselves , confident that the fort would soon be taken .
" they have n't got a corporal 's guard to defend it ! "
cried <name> gilroy .
" nearly everyone of those inside is sick .
come on ! "
the noise was now deafening , for soldiers and indians were discharging their weapons as rapidly as possible .
the red men had brought with them a long board , to which <unk> were nailed .
this board was now set <unk> against the stockade , and a dozen warriors rushed upon it .
" down with them ! "
shouted captain moore .
" heave the plank off ! "
a dozen soldiers started to do his bidding .
the first that showed himself was shot down , and the second shared a similar fate .
but others were more successful , and into the ditch went the board with a loud splash , carrying the indians with it .
the soldiers set up a shout of triumph , and as the red men fell back those who could gain a point of vantage fired on the enemy .
by this movement three indians were left in the ditch dead and several others were wounded .
a desperado was also brought down .
those that were uninjured lost no time in seeking cover ; and thus the first advance on the fort came to an end .
all told , the attack had lasted nearly an hour , and when it was over it was found that everybody was hot , dry , and <name> .
but , fortunately , water was to be had in plenty , and a drink refreshed all .
the dead and wounded were carried away , and the latter were made as comfortable as the limited means of the fort afforded .
" they wo n't come back in a hurry , " said the young captain .
" the indians have had their eyes opened . "
" how soon can those re-enforcements come , <name> ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't think they can get here before to-morrow noon , if as soon .
they 'll have a long journey before them , and a body of several hundred soldiers ca n't travel as fast as a single person . "
" of course they 'll be cavalry , " put in darry .
" i <name> so  if the cavalry was at fort prescott when leeson got there . "
colonel fairfield was much disturbed by the shooting , and he insisted upon sitting up and hearing the particulars .
" good ! "
he murmured .
" keep them off another twenty-four hours and we shall be saved , " and then he went off in another stupor .
all was now as quiet as if not an enemy was within a mile of the fort .
but the soldiers remained on guard , and this vigilance was increased as the sun went down in the west .
" this night <name> tell the tale , " was old benson 's comment .
" boys , it's do or die , and do n't you forget it ! "
whether or not the old scout was right we shall soon see .
chapter xxx .
signals in the dark .
" <name> , i 've got a scheme to <unk> the desperadoes and indians , and i've a good mind to propose it to <name> . "
it was darry who spoke , as he and <name> were eating an early supper that night , in one corner of the <unk> .
" if the scheme is good for anything let <name> have it by all means , " answered his cousin .
" heaven knows we need all the help we can get ! "
" my scheme is this , " went on darry .
" those indians and the desperadoes must know something of our sending off for re-enforcements .
now why ca n't <name> send out old benson and a few others , to steal off for several miles and light camp-fires , blow bugles , and all that , to make the enemy think the re-enforcements are close at hand ? "
<name> clapped his hands .
" that 's a grand scheme ! "
he cried .
" let 's speak to <name> about it at once . "
the supper was soon finished , and they sought out the young captain , who was dividing up his force for guard duty during the night .
" i was thinking of such a scheme myself , " he said , when he had heard them .
" and old benson suggested it , too .
perhaps i 'll do it . "
" if old benson goes ca n't i go with him ? "
asked <name> quickly .
" and let me go too , " put in darry .
" you wo n't miss us as much as you would miss two of your regulars . "
at this the young captain grew grave .
" old benson said he would like to take you along .
perhaps it would be best , too . "
he paused .
" you see , they may fall on the fort to-night and wipe us out completely . "
" oh , <name> , do you really believe that ? "
" they <name> certainly attack us , and the men fit for duty number but thirty-four .
thirty-four against several hundred is not much of a force , even in a fort . "
the matter was talked over for half an hour , and old benson was called in for consultation .
in the end it was decided that the old scout should head a party consisting of two regulars and the two boys , who were to <name> a drum and a bugle and a good supply of matches for bonfires .
" if you can pass them without being seen , head straight for <unk> hill , " said captain moore .
" blow the bugle there , and beat the drum , and then move over to decker 's falls and light your first camp-fire .
after that you 'll have to do what you think is best . "
" i understand , captain , " answered the old scout .
" and trust me to fool 'em nicely , if the trick can be done at all . "
" it is not going to be an <unk> night , " went on the young officer .
" so you <name> have your own troubles in getting away from the fort without being seen . "
" i know a route , " answered old benson .
" trust me for it . "
but just then he would say no more .
the men to go along were named cass and <unk> .
cass was a good drummer and bugler , and <unk> was noted for his good sight and the accuracy of his aim .
all of the party went fully armed , and took with them rations for two days .
" good-by , <name> , " said the captain affectionately , and he took his brother by the hand .
" i <name> you pull through in safety . "
" and i <name> you do too , <name> , " answered <name> , and his lip quivered as he spoke .
perhaps this would be the last time he would see his brother alive .
never before had the situation appeared so serious as now .
darry also received an affectionate farewell .
in absolute silence old benson led his little party to a far corner of the stockade , where there was a small gate , fastened with a strong log bar .
this gate was opened just far enough for them to slip through , and then closed again .
their mission had begun .
there was no telling how it would end .
slipping into the ditch , the old scout told the others to lie low , while he and <unk> surveyed the situation .
it was silent , and from overhead only a few stars twinkled down upon them .
old benson presently pointed with his bony hand .
" clear that way , aint it ? "
he whispered .
" looks so , " answered <unk> , after a searching look lasting several minutes .
" i would n't go too close to that patch of underbrush , though . "
the party began crawling along the ditch , until they came to a little gully which the last heavy rains had formed .
here they progressed on hands and knees until they reached some low brushwood .
then old benson , still crouching close to the ground , set off on a <unk> , and the others came after him in indian file .
if they had been discovered , neither indians nor desperadoes gave any sign , and inside of ten minutes the fort was left out of sight , and they were standing in a hollow fringed with <name> bushes .
the boys were somewhat out of breath , and old benson gave them a short spell in which to get back their wind .
" we were right , they are none of 'em in this vicinity , " said the old scout .
" getting away was easier than i expected . "
" it was no easy matter with the drum , " came from cass .
" i came pretty close to falling and smashing it once . "
the course now led up a small hill and then across a valley to another hill , a distance of nearly three miles .
the trail was by no means straight and the walking was bad , and <name> and darry had all they could do to keep up with the others .
at the last minute captain moore had given the boys half a dozen rockets , and explained how the fireworks were to be set off .
everything they could do to puzzle the enemy was to be done .
at last they gained the top of <unk> 's hill  so called because <name> <unk> fell there while battling with some <unk> early in the <unk> .
bringing around his bugle , cass blew a long blast and then a regular military call , which echoed and <unk> throughout the mountains .
this was followed by a long roll on the drum , and then another call on the bugle .
after this all waited impatiently , gazing in the direction of the fort , which was , of course , hidden in the darkness .
" there they go ! "
cried <name> , and as he spoke two rockets flared up , dying out almost instantly .
the boys had planted two of the fireworks given them , and now these were touched off and went hissing skyward , leaving a trail of sparks behind .
two minutes later a single rocket went up from the fort .
" that 's the last , " observed old benson .
" i 'll wager that <name> set the indians and the desperadoes to thinking , " said cass .
" they 'll think some more when they see a camp-fire over decker 's falls , " put in <unk> .
" they 'll imagine that they are being surrounded . "
" do n't be too sure , " came from the old scout .
" white ox is no fool .
he has been through too much fighting .
if we can only make him hold off a bit that 's as much as we can expect .
you can bet he 'll have spies up here in less than an hour from now . "
the march was now for decker 's falls , a distance three miles to the westward .
again they advanced in indian file , <unk> now leading and old benson bringing up the rear .
a mile had been covered , when the regular in front called a halt .
" a small camp is ahead , " he said .
" there , through the trees . "
without delay old benson went forward to investigate .
he found three desperadoes talking earnestly among themselves , while warming some coffee over a small fire .
listening to their talk he learned that they had been out on the trails leading to fort prescott , and had come in with the news that no re-enforcements for fort <name> were within forty miles of the latter place .
" gilroy and white ox <name> be glad to hear our news , " said one of the crowd .
" they 've been afraid all along colonel fairfield had sent out for aid . "
not stopping to hear anything further , old benson crawled back to the place where he had left the others .
" we must capture those men , dead or alive , " he said .
" if they <name> their news to the enemy there <name> be another attack on the fort within an hour . "
leaving the drum , bugle , and remaining rockets in a safe place , our friends advanced until all could see the three desperadoes quite plainly .
one of the fellows was unknown to <name> , but the others were <name> fetter and nat potts .
the desperadoes had placed their rifles against a tree , and old benson motioned to the boys to secure the weapons .
as <name> grabbed up two of the firearms and darry the third , the desperadoes leaped to their feet in alarm .
" hands up ! "
sang out old benson .
" hands up , or you are all dead men ! "
the scout 's rifle was raised , and so were the weapons of cass and <unk> , and the desperadoes found themselves at a disadvantage .
yet fetter was game , and he quickly reached for a pistol hanging in his belt .
but the movement , quick as it was , was not quick enough for <unk> , and as the regular 's rifle rang out fetter fell headlong across the camp-fire .
" do you surrender ? "
asked old benson .
" yes , " came from potts , sulkily , and his companion said the same .
in the meantime fetter had rolled from the camp-fire and was breathing his last at potts ' feet .
the sight was a thrilling one , and caused <name> and darry to shudder .
" ca n't i do something for that poor wretch ? "
asked <name> , of benson , but before the old scout could answer fetter breathed his last .
in a few minutes more potts was made a close prisoner .
while he was being tied up , the third man made a quick leap into the woods .
" after him ! "
cried benson , and cass and <unk> did as commanded .
soon the desperado and the two regulars were out of sight and hearing .
chapter xxxi .
burning of the stockade .
" what <name> you do with him ? "
asked <name> of benson , as he pointed to nat potts .
" do n't be hard on me , " pleaded potts .
" i meant you no harm . "
" you ought to be <name> , " grunted the old scout .
" you aint fit to live and you know it , potts .
you could make an honest living if you wanted to , but you would rather cheat and steal . "
" it was <name> gilroy who got me into this , " answered potts .
" he   " " do n't put it off on to somebody else , potts ! "
cried the old scout wrathfully .
" if you aint got backbone enough to be honest , it 's your own fault . "
" <name> you let me go , if i promise to leave this territory ? "
asked potts eagerly .
" no , <unk> ! "
was benson 's answer .
" you shall suffer the full extent of the law , and do n't you forget it ! "
while waiting for the return of cass and <unk> , the old scout searched potts and the dead body of fetter , taking away all their weapons and some papers which potts carried .
these papers showed how <unk> was the plot which the desperadoes had formed to gain possession of the money stored at fort <name> , and how they had <unk> the indians under white ox and other chiefs to assist them .
at last cass and <unk> came back , all out of breath with running .
" did he get away ? "
questioned benson quickly .
" he did and he did n't , " answered cass .
" he ran up cedar <name> , and seeing we were after him he tried to jump to the other side of the canyon .
but he missed his footing in the dark , and went down , and that's the last we seen or heard of him . "
" and that 's the last anybody <name> see or hear of him , " answered the old scout .
" that canyon is three hundred feet deep , and nothing but sharp rocks , sides and bottom .
he 's done for . "
the march onward was now resumed , the old scout forcing potts to walk between himself and the boys , with his hands tied tightly behind him .
" if you make any noise it <name> cost you your life , " said benson to the prisoner , and thereupon potts became perfectly mute .
to tell the truth the desperado was thoroughly downcast , and his face was filled with despair .
they calculated that it was two o'clock in the morning when the heights above decker 's falls was gained , a wild spot , from which old benson had often viewed the fort , miles below , in the valley .
the driest possible brush was gathered , and on this were heaped several good-sized limbs , that the fire might burn an hour or two .
quarter of a mile away another similar fire was kindled , and at this spot the boys set off all but one of their remaining rockets .
" there is the answer from the fort ! "
said <name> , as two rockets flared up in the dim distance .
" anyway , <name> knows we have gotten this far . "
" but he does n't know of the adventure we have had on the way , " said darry .
as soon as the fires were well under way old benson began to lead the way down the mountain side toward a stretch of timber running within half a mile of the fort .
while they were in the midst of the forest a distant firing broke upon their ears .
" is that from the fort ? "
asked <name> quickly .
" reckon it is , lad , " replied the old scout .
" then our signals have n't done any good . "
" perhaps they have .
but it may be that others have been out spying , and they have brought in the same report that potts and his crowd were carrying . "
as they advanced the firing died away for half an hour , but then it was renewed with vigor .
coming to another hilltop , they could see the flashes , of fire as the rifles and cannon were discharged .
the indians and desperadoes had approached fort <name> in the darkness , hoping to catch those inside napping .
but the regulars had opened the firing , and two indians were killed at the very outset .
the red men had brought forward a large quantity of brush , and at the risk of their lives they heaped this against the wooden stockade .
when <name> and the others who were with him gained the plains surrounding the stronghold they saw that the brush was burning at a lively rate .
" they are firing the fort ! "
cried darry .
" heaven have <name> on those inside ! "
" i see nothing of indians or desperadoes , " said <name> .
" where have they gone , benson ? "
" reckon they did n't like those last signals , " answered the old scout .
from a distance they watched the burning of the brush with interest .
here and there they saw the stockade take fire , and then saw a blaze on the stable within the fort yard .
" the fire has reached inside ! "
groaned <name> .
" the place is doomed ! "
" come on !
there is no use of our staying here longer ! "
cried benson , and led the way across the plain , now lit up by the conflagration beyond .
he forced potts with him .
suddenly several shots rang out , and <name> felt a bullet graze his hand .
then he saw cass pitch forward on his face , and heard potts give a yell of mortal agony .
" poor cass , he 's a goner ! "
muttered <unk> .
" and the desperado is dead , too . "
no more was said , for all felt they must run as never before , if they would save themselves .
soon the gully was reached , and they dropped to shelter .
but no more shots followed , and in a few minutes more they were close to the burning stockade .
" friends ! "
shouted benson , to a guard .
" do n't shoot !
come out here and put out the fire ! "
" is that you ? "
came from captain moore , in the semi-darkness .
" are <name> and darry safe ? "
" yes , " came from the boys .
there was no time to say more , for already the soldiers were forming a bucket brigade , carrying water with which to put out the flames .
some had long poles with hooks , and with these they dragged a large part of the burning brush into the ditch .
all this while some of the regulars remained on guard , and occasionally a shot rang out , answered by another from a great distance .
" they have surely withdrawn , " said the young captain .
" benson , the trick worked after all . "
" that 's right , captain .
but it wo n't work many hours , you can depend upon that . "
" if it only makes them hold off until morning i shall be satisfied , " concluded captain moore .
by the exertion of the soldiers the fire was kept from communicating with any of the buildings but the stable , and of this structure only a corner of the roof suffered .
but the stockade was greatly damaged , and by the time the last spark was out it was seen that it had sustained three openings each eight to twelve feet long .
" we 'll have to repair these , " said captain moore ; and , tired though the workers were , he made them haul fresh timbers from the woodpile and also tear up part of the barn floor , that the stockade might present a whole front to the enemy once more .
the fighting had greatly agitated the women in the fort , and nobody had slept for two nights .
yet even now , with the fire out and silence brooding everywhere , nobody thought of going to bed .
all felt that this was but the lull before the greater storm .
if only the relief would come !
such was the thought of everyone but drossdell , who still remained in the <unk> , heavily chained , hands and feet .
drossdell was deeply downcast , and with good reason .
at last came the welcome signs of <name> in the east , and then a few of the soldiers , who could stand the strain no longer , threw themselves down to sleep .
the others , pale and haggard , sat around in little groups wondering what was going to happen next .
to each was served <unk> coffee and the best rations the fort afforded .
" it can not last much longer , " said captain moore , trying to cheer them up .
" relief must come sooner or later . "
he had now but a pitiful twenty-eight men left , including old benson and <name> and darry .
twenty-eight !
what could such a number do against the attack of two or three hundred desperadoes and indians ?
the situation was certainly one to make the stoutest heart quail .
" it was too bad you came out here on a vacation , " said the captain sadly , to his brother and his cousin .
" perhaps you 'll never see home again . "
" oh , <name> , do you really think it 's so bad ? "
came from darry .
" it is hard to tell what i think , darry .
i know we are in a mighty tight box . "
" let us <name> for the best , " said <name> .
" leeson must be doing something . "
" if he was n't caught and shot down , <name> . "
" that is true , " and now <name> gave a long sigh that meant a good deal .
" there is but one thing in our favor now , this daylight .
but if no relief reaches us by sundown   " the captain did not finish , but shook his head .
a moment later one of the guards called down that he could see some indians to the northwest of the fort .
a glass was brought into play , and by this a party of seventy-five red men could be made out marching directly for the fort .
behind the red men came a dozen or fifteen whites .
hardly had this discovery been made when another body of indians and whites were seen marching upon the fort from the south .
" we are to suffer a double attack now ! "
was captain moore 's comment .
" heaven help us and bring us through it in safety ! "
chapter xxxii .
relief at last  conclusion .
the attack did not come until half an hour later , and during the time of waiting the nerves of the boys were strained to the utmost .
the seriousness of the situation was depicted upon the faces of all the soldiers , who felt that the coming contest must decide whether or not the fort was to stand .
the firing began on the part of the indians and desperadoes , who advanced upon the stronghold from four points of the compass at once .
the enemy had learned the folly of <unk> their force , and indians and whites came on in a wide open skirmish line .
the soldiers within the stockade fired upon the advancing foe as best they could .
yet by the time red men and desperadoes were within reach of the stockade only three of the foe had fallen .
as before , some of the indians carried a board with strips nailed across it for steps , and the desperadoes had a similar contrivance .
the two boards were placed at opposite ends of the stockade , and , while some of the enemy began to mount them , others came rushing on with a tree trunk , which they used as a <unk> against the stockade gate .
the noise was now terrific , as rifle and cannon shot sounded out , mingled with the <unk> of the indians and the groans and shrieks of the wounded and dying .
as for <name> and darry , the first shock over , each felt as if he was in a dream  as if this terrible sight presented to their gaze could not be true .
they shot off their rifles mechanically , yet when it was all over <name> remembered how he had sent one redskin tumbling back into the ditch , and darry could tell of a desperado who had dropped his gun because of a shot through the shoulder .
" fight to the last , men ! "
shouted captain moore , as he discharged his pistol at the leader of the desperadoes .
gilroy had hit him in the forearm , but the young officer 's aim was still more true , and <name> gilroy went down never to rise again .
in the meanwhile old benson was having a terrific hand-to-hand encounter with white ox .
each had fired a shot at the other , and now they closed in , the indian chief with his hunting-knife and the old scout with his clubbed rifle .
the struggle was as short as it was thrilling .
benson made a pass which the indian chief dodged .
then white ox plunged his knife toward the old scout 's heart , but a quick turn made it catch in benson 's <unk> .
down came the rifle butt a second time , and the blow , catching white ox on the neck , forced him to his knees .
even then he struck at <unk> legs , but the old scout leaped over his head .
then down came the rifle butt once more , and the indian chief gave a groan which was his last .
fully sixty indians and a score of desperadoes were now within the stockade , and it looked as if all was lost to our friends .
a part of the regulars were fighting at the entrance to the stable , but the majority were gathered around captain moore at the entrance to the <unk> quarters .
behind these were the ladies of the fort and the officers who were sick .
" perhaps we had better surrender , " said colonel fairfield , when told by his wife of the condition of affairs .
" if we do n't   " he could not finish .
" kill the white soldiers ! "
was the cry from the indians .
" white ox has fallen !
they must all die !
spare nobody ! "
captain moore was now fighting as never before .
beside him stood old benson , and not far away were <name> and darry .
each of the number was wounded , and hardly any of the regulars were better off .
ammunition was running low .
still the horrible din continued , and the dust and smoke were blinding .
but now , hark , what was that ?
from a distance sounded out a bugle call .
then came a shot , followed by another , and then a regular volley .
captain moore started , and his eyes lit with pleasure .
" the relief ! "
he shouted .
" the relief from fort prescott !
boys , we are saved ! "
" hurrah , the relief ! "
was the shout which made the fort ring from end to end .
" the relief !
we are saved ! "
" give it to the reds and to the desperadoes ! "
came from old benson .
" teach 'em the lesson so they wo n't forget it !
do n't let a skunk of 'em escape ! "
nearer and nearer came the shots from without , and a bugle continued to blow calls to a detachment still further away .
then up to the fort rode a troop of dashing cavalry from fort prescott , <name> leeson beside them , and every horse covered with foam .
crack !
crack !
crack !
spoke up the firearms of the newcomers , and indians and desperadoes fell in all directions .
" we must retreat ! "
shouted one of the desperadoes .
" the game is up ! "
" retreat !
retreat ! "
came from the others ; and the red men took up the cry .
soon the enemy were pouring from the fort grounds even more rapidly than they had entered .
there was only a pitiful handful that could follow them , the young captain , benson , and nine regulars .
but there was no need for even that number , for the blood of the cavalry was up and every desperado and red man received one or more shots the instant he appeared .
soon the enemy were flying in all directions .
but the cavalry went after them , and in the end all but four desperadoes and thirty-six indians were killed , the others being forced to surrender .
it was rather a silent party that gathered in and around the fort that night .
victory had come to our friends , but the cost had been a heavy one , and the hospital <name> of the fort was filled to <unk> .
<name> leeson came in for many a warm <unk> , and was made to tell his story over and over again .
" it was a close shave , " said the old <name> .
" twice i got in a close box with the redskins an ' i had to shoot one of 'em down afore i could git away .
thet 's wot kept me so long .
i 'm glad we was n't an hour later , fer then mebbe we 'd 'a ' been too late . "
all of the principal desperadoes were dead and the same can be said of the indians .
among the slain was found the body of bicker , and , if the truth must be told , nobody mourned his loss .
" he is responsible for a great deal of this suffering , " said captain moore .
" had he lived it is likely he would have been <unk> and shot . "
both of the boys had been slightly wounded , yet each felt happy when the fighting was over and they were assured that from henceforth they would be safe to come and go as they pleased .
" it was like a regular campaign , " said darry .
" <name> , we have become soldiers after all ! "
" that 's so , darry , " replied <name> .
" we can call ourselves , after this , the boys of the fort ! "
* * * * * a few words more , and we <name> bring this story of fort life in the great northwest to a close .
two weeks after the events just narrated <name> and darry returned to their homes .
here they were received with open arms by their parents , who had heard all manner of ugly reports and who half expected to see them coming back wounded and crippled for life .
but the lads soon proved that they were not so bad off as that , and inside of a few months both were as well as ever .
at the fort an active campaign was started under captain moore and the commander of the cavalry , and this resulted in the rounding up of six more desperadoes and thirty indians .
lieutenant <name> and four regulars were found as prisoners of the indians and were released .
the desperadoes were turned over to the civil courts , and were dealt with severely , two being <name> and the others being imprisoned for years .
drossdell was <unk> , and after a long trial was sentenced to imprisonment in a military prison for ten years .
he served six years , after which he was released .
to his credit be it said , he turned over a new leaf , and from the west went to cuba , where he fought with the cubans against spanish rule .
he was with the cubans at the fall of <name> and died a few weeks later of tropical fever .
as soon as the proper medicines could be obtained and administered , those who had been drugged at the fort began to recover , and inside of two weeks colonel fairfield , captain <name> , and our other friends were around once more , although rather weak .
the mining company whose money had been saved was exceedingly thankful to captain moore and the others for what had been done , and when , several years later , the young captain left the regular army , this company offered him a lucrative position , which he accepted and which he fills to this day .
old benson and <name> leeson still continue to roam the great northwest , and are happy .
occasionally they receive a visit from <name> and darry , and are never more satisfied than when they have the two young men with them on a hunting and fishing tour .
" takes me back to years ago , " says old benson .
" years ago , when you were both green as grass . "
" well , we are not so green now , " replies <name> , with a quiet smile .
" through bitter experience we have learned a thing or two . "
" now it is over i am glad i did n't miss it , " puts in darry .
" we got a genuine taste of soldier life , did n't we ? "
" that 's so , " adds <name> .
" we were really and truly the boys of the fort . "

preface " <name> <name> and his double " is a complete story in itself , but forms the twelfth volume in a line issued under the general title of " <name> <name> series . "
this series was begun some years ago by the publication of " <name> <name> at oak hall , " in which my young readers were introduced to a wide-awake american lad at a typical american boarding-school .
the publication of this volume was followed by " <name> <name> in the south seas , " to which portion of our globe the lad journeyed to clear up a question concerning his parentage .
next came " <name> <unk> return to school , " telling of additional happenings at oak hall ; " <name> <name> in the far north , " where he went on a second journey looking for his father ; " <name> <name> and his classmates , " in which our young hero showed what he could do under most trying circumstances ; " <name> <name> at <name> ranch , " in which he took part in many strenuous adventures in the wild west ; " <name> <name> and his rivals , " in which the youth outwitted some of his old-time enemies ; " <name> <name> on cave island , " giving the details of a remarkable sea voyage and strange doings ashore ; " <name> <name> and the runaways , " in which the boy taught some of his school chums a <unk> lesson ; " <name> <name> in the gold fields , " whither he went in search of a lost mine ; and finally " <name> <name> at bear camp , " which was located in the <unk> mountains , and where we last left him .
in the present volume we find our hero in a new field of activity .
having graduated from school , he has taken up the study of civil engineering , and while engaged in that calling in texas he becomes mixed up in most unusual happenings , the particulars of which are given in the pages that follow .
once more i wish to thank my young readers , and many of their parents , for all the kind things they have said regarding my stories .
i trust that the reading of the present book <name> not only please but also profit the young folks .

"
announced the guide 226 " hold tight , <name> !
i 'll help you , " returned <name> , quickly 256 <name> <name> and his double chapter i off for a <unk> " what is the matter , <name> ?
you look rather mystified . "
" i am mystified , <name> , " replied <name> <name> .
" i have a letter here that i ca n't understand at all . "
" whom is it from ? "
questioned <name> <name> , as she came closer to her brother , who was <unk> in the largest easy-chair the wadsworth library contained .
" it 's from a shopkeeper in coburntown , mr. wecks , the <unk> .
he wants to know which pair of shoes i have decided to keep , and asks me kindly to return the pair i do n't want . "
" well , what of that , <name> ? "
continued his sister , as the youth paused with a wrinkle on his forehead .
" ca n't you make up your mind which pair of shoes you want to keep ? "
" i certainly can not , seeing that i have n't had any shoes from <unk> store , " returned <name> , with a faint smile .
" i have n't been in his place for nearly a year , and the last time i was there i bought a pair of <unk> and paid for them . "
" oh , then the letter must be meant for somebody else , <name> .
mr. wecks has got his customers mixed . "
" perhaps so .
but in the letter he speaks of the two pairs of shoes i took away with me .
that looks as if somebody had gotten two pairs of shoes in my name . "
" well , as we are going out sleighing this afternoon , why do n't you drive to coburntown and drop into his shop and explain matters ? "
suggested the sister .
" i guess that would be best , <name> . "
<name> folded up the letter and placed it in his pocket .
" how soon <name> you be ready ? "
" inside of quarter of an hour . "
" and how about <name> ? "
" she was almost ready when i came downstairs . "
" good !
then we can get an early start and have a good long ride besides stopping at coburntown , where i suppose you and <name> can do a little shopping while i am at wecks 's store . "
" that <name> be fine , <name> !
i would like to match some ribbon , and the only place i can do it is in the french shop in coburntown ; " and thus speaking <name> <name> hurried out of the room to get ready for the <unk> .
<name> had proposed the ride just before lunch , and the young people living at the wadsworth mansion had telephoned over to the basswood home , asking if <name> basswood would accompany them .
" sure i 'll go  be glad to ! "
<name> 's former school chum had answered over the wire .
" i have n't a thing to do this afternoon , and a first <unk> of the season <name> tickle me to death . "
" oh , i do n't want it to kill you , <name> , " <name> had answered gaily .
" just the same , you be ready for us when we come over ; " and to this <name> had agreed .
although it was still early in the <name> , there had been a heavy fall of snow two days before and now the roads in and around crumville were in excellent condition for sleighing .
the musical sound of <unk> could be heard in all directions , and this had made <name> anxious to get out on the road , even though he had to spend most of his time indoors studying , as we shall learn later .
<name> had already given orders to the hostler connected with the wadsworth estate , and now this man brought to the front of the mansion a fine , big sleigh drawn by a pair of <unk> , <unk> steeds .
the sleigh was well provided with heavy robes to protect its occupants from the cold .
" oh , <name> , i 'm so glad to go sleighing ! "
burst out <name> wadsworth , as she came bounding down the broad stairway of the mansion to meet him .
" is n't it just glorious weather ? "
" it sure is , " he answered , as he gave her a warm glance .
to <name> , <name> was the most beautiful girl in the world , and just now , clad as she was in her dainty <unk> coat and her <unk> <unk> hat , she looked more bewitching to him than ever .
" going for a ride , eh ? "
came from <name> 's uncle , dunston <name> , who had just finished a belated lunch .
" well , have a good time , and don't let that pair of grays run away with you .
<name> was telling me they are feeling quite <unk> lately .
i guess they do n't get exercise enough . "
" oh , do n't worry , uncle dunston .
i 'm sure i can manage them , " answered <name> .
" sure you can ! "
returned his uncle , heartily .
" too bad you couldn't have asked an old fellow like me to go along , " he continued , making a wry face .
" why , you can come along if you want to .
ca n't he , <name> ? "
burst out <name> .
" we 'd be very glad to have you . "
" he 's only fooling , <name> , " answered <name> .
" you could n't hire uncle dunston to go sleighing to-day .
i saw him cleaning up his shotgun right after breakfast .
and i 'll wager he has just come in from hunting and expects to go out again this afternoon .
how about it , uncle  am i right ? "
" you 've got me , davy , " answered the man , with a grin .
" you see , i ca n't get over my old habit of going hunting when i get the chance .
and now that this snow is on the ground , it 's just fine for tracking rabbits . "
" did you get any this morning ? "
" a few .
i did n't go very far .
this afternoon i am going deeper into the woods , and i guarantee to bring back enough to make the biggest rabbit <unk> to-morrow you ever saw ; " and , thus speaking , the uncle hastened away .
he had spent many years of his life roaming the world in quest of game both big and little , and now , though of late years he had done his best to settle down , it was still impossible for him to give up his hunting habit entirely .
<name> soon appeared ready for the ride .
<name> had already donned his heavy overcoat , fur cap , and his <unk> .
he assisted the girls into the sleigh and saw to it that they were well tucked in with robes .
" have a good time and do n't stay out too late , " were the farewell words of mrs. wadsworth , who had come to the door to see them off .
" well , you know we do n't expect to be back to dinner this evening , " answered <name> .
" we can get something to eat at coburntown , or some other place , and then drive back in the moonlight . "
" very well , but do n't make it too late , " answered the <name> of the mansion .
and then <name> took up the reins , <unk> to the team , and away the sleigh started out of the wadsworth grounds and down the highway leading to the basswood home .
<name> was on the lookout for them , and by the time <name> had drawn up beside the horse-block he was outside to meet them .
" good afternoon , everybody , " he said gaily , lifting his cap .
" this is just fine of you to take me along . "
" let <name> come in back here with me , " said <name> , " and that <name> give <name> a chance to sit in front .
i know she always likes to be up ahead , " and <name> smiled knowingly .
" suits me , " answered <name> , quickly ; and then assisted <name> to make the change , which , however , the miss did not undertake without blushing , for it may as well be admitted here <name> thought as much of <name> as he did of her .
" oh , <name> , do you think the grays <name> behave themselves to-day ? "
asked the girl , partly to conceal her embarrassment .
" i 'm going to make them behave , " he answered , sturdily .
" i do n't believe they have been out of the stable for several days .
you know we do n't use the horses nearly as much as we used to , before we got the automobile . "
" i 'll watch them . "
<name> looked behind him .
" all right back there ? "
" yes , " answered his sister .
" but please do n't drive too fast . "
" i do n't believe sleighing <name> seem too fast after the riding we have been doing in the auto , " answered the brother .
he took up the reins again , and once more the turnout sped along the highway .
they made a turn , passed along the main street of crumville , and also passed the large wadsworth jewelry works , and then took to a road leading to coburntown , some miles distant .
the air was cold but clear , with the bright <name> sparkling on the snow , and all of the young people were in the best of humor .
" say , <name> , how would you like to be back at oak hall ? "
cried <name> , while the sleigh sped along .
" would n't we have the dandy time snowballing each other , and snowballing old horsehair ? "
" so we would , <name> , " answered <name> , his eyes gleaming .
" we sure did have some good times at that school . "
" how are you and <name> getting along with your civil engineering course ? "
" all right , i think .
mr. ramsdell says he is greatly pleased with our work . "
" that 's fine .
i almost wish i had taken up civil engineering myself .
but dad wants me to go into real estate with him .
he thinks there is a big chance in that line these days , when crumville is just beginning to wake up . "
" has n't your dad got a big rival in <name> poole ? "
" oh , no !
poole is n't in it any more when it comes to big deals .
you see , he was so close and miserly in all his business affairs that a great many people became afraid of him . "
" what has become of nat poole ? "
questioned <name> .
" did he go back to oak hall ? "
" for a short while only .
when his folks found out that he had failed to graduate they were awfully angry .
mr. poole claimed that it was the fault of the school and so he took nat away and told him he would have to go to work .
i think nat is working in some store , although where , i do n't know . "
" i do n't think it 's in crumville or we should have seen him , " said <name> .
" i never want to meet that boy again , " pouted <name> .
" i 'll never get over how meanly he acted toward us . "
" it 's not so much nat 's fault as it is his bringing up , " remarked <name> .
" his father never treated him half decently .
but i <name> nat makes a man of himself in spite of the way he used to treat us , " went on the youth generously .
" by the way , <name> , did n't you say your father had gone away ? "
queried <name> , a few minutes later .
" yes , he has gone to chicago on very important business .
it seems an old friend of his  a mr. enos , who was once his partner in an <name> store  died , and now the lawyers want to see my father about settling up the enos estate . "
" an <name> store ? "
queried <name> .
" i never knew that your father had been in any such business . "
" it was years ago  before my folks came to crumville .
you see , my father and this mr. enos had been chums from early boyhood .
my father says that mr. enos was a very peculiar sort of man , who was all wrapped up in pictures and painting .
he got my father to advance a thousand dollars he had saved up , and on that money the two opened an <name> store .
but they could n't make a go of it , and so they gave it up , and while mr. enos went west my father came here . "
" maybe the dead man left your father some money , " suggested <name> .
" that is what my mother said to dad .
but he thinks not .
he thinks it is more than likely mr. enos died in debt and left his affairs all tangled up , and that the lawyers want my father to help straighten them out . "
" i 'd like to be able to paint , " said <name> , with a sigh .
" i think some of those little <unk> are just too lovely for anything . "
" why do n't you take it up ?
there must be some teacher in crumville , " returned <name> .
" let 's both do it ! "
cried <name> .
" i used to paint a little before father and i did so much traveling .
i would like to take it up again .
it would be very interesting . "
while the young folks were talking , the pair of <unk> grays had been speeding over the snow of the road at a good rate of speed .
<name> , however , had them well in hand , so that there was little danger of their running away .
" we 'll be to benson crossroads soon , <name> , " remarked <name> a while later , after they had passed over a long hill lined on either side with tidy farms .
" which road are you going to take  through <unk> or around <unk> 's hill ? "
" i have n't made up my mind , " answered <name> .
he looked at <name> .
" have you any preference ? "
" oh , let us go up around <unk> 's hill ! "
cried <name> .
" that is always such a splendid ride .
there is so much of an outlook . "
" yes , let us go by way of the hill by all means , " added <name> .
" it is n't very nice through <unk> , past all those woolen mills . "
" all right , the <unk> road it is , " answered <name> ; and forward they went once more as fast as ever .
they soon passed the crossroads , and then took the long , winding road that led around one side of the hill just mentioned .
here travel since the snow had fallen had evidently been heavy , for the roadway was packed down until it was almost as smooth as glass .
over this surface the spirited grays dashed at an increased rate of speed .
" some team , believe me ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" mr. wadsworth ought to put them on a <unk> . "
" papa does not believe in racing , " answered <name> .
" but he always did like to have a horse that had some go in him . "
" hark ! "
cried <name> , a moment later .
" what is that sound ? "
" it 's an auto coming , " announced <name> , looking behind them .
" a big touring-car , and whoever is in it seems to be in a tremendous hurry . "
" i wish they would n't cut out their <unk> , " was <name> 's comment , as he saw the grays pick up their ears .
" they have no right to run with the <unk> open . "
as the touring-car came closer those in the sleigh who were able to look back saw that it was running at a great rate of speed and swaying from side to side of the roadway .
it contained four young men , out , evidently , for a gloriously good time .
<name> did not dare look back to see what was coming .
the grays had their ears laid well back and their whole manner showed that they were growing more nervous every instant .
" hi !
stop that noise ! "
yelled <name> , jumping up and shaking his hand at the <unk> automobile .
but those in the car paid no attention to him .
the fellow at the wheel put on a fresh burst of speed , and with a wild rush and a roar the touring-car shot past the sleigh and the frightened horses , and in a few seconds more disappeared around a turn of the road .
as might have been expected , the coming and going of the big machine , with its unearthly roar , was too much for the <unk> grays .
both reared up wildly on their hind legs , backing the sleigh off to one side of the roadway .
" whoa there !
whoa ! "
cried <name> , and did his best to keep the team in hand .
but they proved too much for him , and in an instant more they came down on all fours and started to run away .
chapter ii something of the past " the horses are running away ! "
" oh , we 'll be killed ! "
such were the cries from the two girls as the <unk> grays tore along the country highway at a speed that seemed marvelous .
" <name> , can i help you ? "
asked <name> , anxiously .
" i do n't think so , " answered the young driver between his set teeth .
" i guess i can bring them down .
anyway , i can try . "
" what shall we do ? "
wailed <name> .
" do n't do anything  sit still , " ordered <name> .
he was afraid that <name> in her excitement might fling herself from the flying sleigh .
on and on bounded the frightened team .
each of the grays now had his bit in his teeth , and it looked as if it would be impossible for <name> to obtain control of the pair .
and , worst of all , they were now approaching a turn , with the hill on one side of the roadway and a gully on the other .
" better keep them as far as possible away from the gully , " suggested <name> .
" that is what i 'm trying to do , " returned <name> , setting his teeth grimly .
<name> <name> was a resolute youth , always doing his best to accomplish whatever he set out to do .
had it been otherwise , it is not likely that he would have occupied the position in which we found him at the opening of our story .
when a very small youth <name> had been found wandering along the railroad tracks near crumville .
he could tell little about himself or how he had come in that position ; and kind people had taken him in and later on had placed him in the local poorhouse .
from that institution he had been taken by an old college professor , named caspar potts , who at that time had been farming for his health .
in crumville , the main industry was the wadsworth jewelry works , owned by mr. <name> wadsworth , who resided , with his wife and his daughter <name> , in the finest mansion of that district .
one day the wadsworth automobile caught fire , and <name> was in danger of being burned to death , when <name> came to her rescue .
this led mr. wadsworth to ask about the boy and about mr. potts .
and when it was learned that the latter was one of the jewelry manufacturer 's former college professors , mr. wadsworth insisted upon it that caspar potts come and live with him , and bring <name> along .
" that boy deserves a good education , " had been <name> <unk> comment , after several interviews with <name> , and as a consequence the youth had been sent off to a first-class boarding-school , as related in the first volume of this series , entitled " <name> <name> at oak hall . "
at the school <name> had made a host of friends , including <name> morr , the son of a united states senator , and <name> <name> , the son of a <name> shipowner .
<name> basswood , the son of a crumville real estate dealer and a lad who had been friendly with <name> for several years , also went to oak hall , and thus he and <name> became closer chums than ever .
the great thing that troubled <name> in those days was the question of his parentage .
some of the mean boys in the school occasionally referred to him as " that poorhouse nobody , " and this brought on several severe quarrels and even a fist fight or two .
" i 'm not going to be a nobody , " said the youth to himself ; and when he received certain information from an old sailor he eagerly went on a quest after his father , as told of in " <name> <name> in the south seas . "
there he managed to locate his uncle , dunston <name> , and learned much concerning his father , <name> <unk> <name> , and also his sister <name> .
coming back from the south seas , <name> returned to school , and then took a trip to the far north , whither his father had gone before him .
there he had many adventures , as already related in another volume .
glad to know that he had found , not only so many kind friends , but also several <name> relatives , <name> went back again to oak hall .
his classmates were more than glad to see him , but others were jealous of his success in life , and several of his enemies , including a certain link merwell , did all they could to annoy him .
the annoyances went from bad to worse , and in the end one boy named jasniff ran away from school , and the other , merwell , was expelled .
<name> 's sister <name> had a friend , <name> endicott , who lived in the far west , and through this young <name> <name> and his chums and also <name> and <name> received an invitation to spend some time at the endicott place , known as <name> ranch .
while in the west <name> once more fell in with link merwell , and this young man , as before , tried to make trouble , but was exposed .
" i <name> i have seen the last of merwell , " said <name> to himself , on returning once again to oak hall .
but this was not to be , for merwell became a student at a rival academy , and once more he and some others did all they could to make life miserable for our hero .
when the christmas holidays came around <name> went back to crumville , where he and his folks resided with the wadsworths , who had taken such a liking to the youth that they did not wish to have him live elsewhere .
directly after christmas came a thrilling robbery of the jewelry works , and <name> and his chums discovered that the crime had been committed by merwell and his crony , jasniff .
after a long sea voyage to cave island , one of the evil-doers was captured , but the other , link merwell , managed to make his escape .
during <name> 's next term at school there was much trouble with one of the teachers , who was harsh and unsympathetic , and as a result some of the boys ran away .
it was <name> who went after them and who , in spite of a fearful flood , managed to bring them back and make them face the music .
then came the graduation exercises at oak hall , <name> receiving high honors .
our hero had promised <name> morr that he would pay the senator 's son a visit .
during this time <name> heard of a gold mine belonging to mrs. morr which had been lost because of a landslide .
all the boys went out west in an endeavor to <unk> this claim .
their adventures were both numerous and hazardous , and once more <name> fell in with link merwell .
but all went well with our young friends , and they had a glorious time visiting yellowstone park and other points of interest .
" now you fellows have got to come on a little trip with me , " <name> <name> had said after he , <name> and <name> , with the others , had returned again to the east .
there was a small steamer belonging to mr. <name> that was tied up at philadelphia getting ready for a trip to portland , maine .
the voyage up the atlantic coast had been productive of several unlooked-for results .
on the way those on the boat had discovered another vessel in flames .
this was a craft being used by a company of moving-picture actors , and some of the latter in their panic had leaped overboard .
our young friends , as well as some of the sailors on their ship , had gone to the rescue ; and among others had picked up a young man , <name> porton by name .
much to the surprise of <name> morr and <name> <name> , <name> porton had looked a good deal like <name> .
not only that , but many of his manners , outwardly , were similar to those of our hero .
following the trip up the coast , it had been decided by the wadsworths and the <unk> to spend part of the summer in the adirondacks , at a spot known as mirror lake .
thither all of the young people and some of the older ones went to enjoy themselves greatly and to meet with a number of strange happenings , all of which have been related in detail in the volume preceding this , entitled " <name> <name> at bear camp . "
the boys fell in with a wild sort of creature whom they at first supposed to be a crazy uncle of nat poole , the son of a miserly money <unk> of crumville .
later , however , the man was found to be a missing uncle of <name> <name> , for whom the <name> family had been seeking for a long time .
although <name> <name> did not know it at the time , the moving-picture company to which <name> porton belonged had also numbered among its members <name> 's former school enemy , link merwell .
from link , <name> porton , who was the good-for-nothing nephew of a burlington lumber dealer , had learned the particulars concerning <name> 's childhood and how he had been placed in the crumville poorhouse and listed as of unknown parentage .
this had caused porton to <unk> a clever scheme , and to mr. <name> he announced himself as the real <name> <name> , stating that our hero was really and truly the nobody that years before everybody had thought him .
this announcement had come like a thunderbolt to poor <name> , and for the time being he knew not what to do or say .
the others , too , especially his sister <name> and his dear friend , <name> , were almost equally affected .
but they clung to him , refusing to believe the story that <name> porton was circulating .
" you take it from me  this is some scheme gotten up by link merwell and this other fellow , " declared one of <name> 's chums .
and on the strength of this declaration the youth took it upon himself to do some clever investigating .
from one of the moving-picture <unk> <name> learned much concerning <name> porton 's past , and then , in company with some of his chums , he journeyed to burlington , where he met mr. obadiah jones , the uncle of porton , and asked the lumber dealer if <name> were his real nephew or not .
" yes , he is my real nephew  the son of my youngest sister , who married a good-for-nothing army man , " replied obadiah jones ; and then gave many particulars .
he stated that his sister 's name had been <name> jones porton , and that years before she had married a certain lieutenant porton of the united states army , an officer who had been discharged because of irregularities in his accounts .
he further stated that the mother of the young man was dead , and what had become of the worthless father he did not know further than that it had been stated he had joined some revolutionists in mexico .
<name> had gotten mr. jones to sign a paper stating the exact truth concerning <name> porton , and with this duly witnessed had returned to bear camp .
all present were glad to know that the cloud hanging over his name had been cleared away .
his sister <name> and her friend <name> hugged him over and over again in their delight .
then came news that link merwell had been captured , and later on this misguided young man was sent to prison for his share in the crime at the jewelry works .
a hunt was instituted for <name> porton , but he had taken time by the forelock and disappeared .
" i do n't believe <name> porton <name> ever bother you again , <name> , " said <name> one day .
but the surmise of the senator 's son proved incorrect , as we shall see .
<name> porton was to show himself and make more trouble than he had ever made before .
chapter iii the team that ran away " oh , <name> , the gully ! "
cried his sister <name> .
" if we go into that we 'll all be killed ! "
" please keep quiet , <name> , " flung back her brother in a low , tense voice .
" these horses are scared enough as it is . "
<name> was doing his best to bring the spirited grays out of their mad gallop .
but they had not been out of the stable for the best part of a week , and this , combined with the scare from the roar of the automobile , had so gotten on their nerves that to calm them seemed next to impossible .
on and on they flew over the packed snow of the hard road , the sleigh <unk> from side to side as it passed over the <unk> in the highway .
<name> was deadly pale and had all she could do to keep from shrieking with fright .
but when she heard <name> address his sister in the above words , she shut her teeth hard , resolved to remain silent , no matter what the cost .
<name> was worried as well as scared  the more so because he realized there was practically nothing he could do to aid <name> in subduing the runaways .
the youth on the front seat had braced both feet on the <unk> of the sleigh , and was pulling back on the reins with all the strength of his vigorous muscles .
thus fully a quarter of a mile was covered  a stretch of the hill road which fortunately was comparatively straight .
but then there loomed up ahead a sharp turn , leading down to the straight road through the valley below .
" <name>  the turn ! "
gasped <name> , unable to keep himself from speaking .
" i see it .
i 'll do what i can , " cried the young driver ; and then pulled on the reins more strongly , if possible , than before .
closer and closer to the dreaded turn in the road the sleigh approached , and as it <name> nearer the girls huddled in their seats almost too terror-stricken to move .
<name> sprang up , totally unconscious of doing so .
" can you make it , <name> , do you think ? "
gasped the real estate man's son , when the turn was less than a hundred feet away .
" i do n't think i 'll try , " was the unexpected answer .
" hold fast , everybody !
we 're going through the fence ! "
the turn in the road led to the left , and as they approached it <name> relaxed his hold on the left rein and pulled with might and main on the right .
this brought the team around just a trifle , but it was enough to keep them from attempting to follow the road  something which would undoubtedly have caused the <unk> around of the sleigh and probably its overturning .
as it was , the team left the roadway , and the next instant had crashed through a frail <unk> and was floundering along in the deep snow of a <unk> and sloping field beyond .
" whoa there ! "
cried <name> , soothingly .
" whoa , <name> !
whoa , <name> ! "
and thus he continued to talk to the team while the sleigh bumped along through the deep snow and over the uneven ground .
running away on the smooth surface of the highway had been one thing ; keeping up such a gait over a ploughed field and in snow almost a foot deep was quite another .
soon the fiery grays broke from their mad gallop into a trot , and a minute later <name> had no trouble in bringing them to a halt .
there they stood in the snow and the furrows of the field , snorting , and emitting clouds of steam from their nostrils .
" hold 'em , <name> , while i get out and go to their heads ! "
cried <name> , and an instant later was out in the snow and had hold of the steeds .
each of the horses was trembling a little , but the run seemed to have done neither of them any harm .
" oh , <name> !
<name> ! "
gasped <name> .
she tried to go on , but could not .
" oh , how thankful i am that you did not attempt to go around that corner ! "
came from <name> .
" if you had tried that we would have been upset and maybe all killed ! "
and she shuddered .
" it was just the right thing to do , <name> , " was <name> 's comment .
" but i do n't know that i would have thought of it .
you are a quick thinker , and i guess we have you to thank for saving our lives . "
" well , we 've broken down somebody 's fence , " returned <name> , not knowing what else to say .
" we 'll have to fix that , i suppose . "
" huh !
what 's a broken fence to saving one 's neck ! "
snorted <name> .
" besides , we only busted a couple of rails , and they are not worth a great deal . "
" <name> , do you think it <name> be safe to ride behind that team any more ? "
questioned <name> .
" i 'm going to do it , " he answered promptly .
" no team of horses is going to get the better of me ! "
" i think , now that they have had this run , they 'll tame down a little , " said <name> .
" besides that , the rest of the road to coburntown is almost straight and flat . "
" yes , and as soon as we get on a straight road i 'll give them all the running they want , " answered <name> .
" i 'll guarantee that by the time we reach town they 'll be just as meek as any one would want them . "
with <name> still at their heads the team was turned around and led to the roadway once more .
there the horses were tied to a tree near by , and then <name> and <name> spent a little time in repairing the damage done to the fence .
" i wish we could find out who those fellows in the auto were , " said <name> , when they were once again on the way .
" they ought to be fined for speeding . "
" i doubt if we 'll be able to locate them , " answered <name> .
and he was right  they never saw or heard of the reckless <unk> again .
as has been mentioned , beyond the hill the road to coburntown was almost straight and level .
and here for over two miles <name> allowed the grays to go along at a good gait , although keeping his eyes on them continually , so that they might not get beyond control .
as a consequence of this additional burst of speed , when they came in sight of the town for which they were bound , the grays were quite docile and willing to behave themselves properly .
" now if you say so , i 'll take you girls around to the french shop , " suggested <name> , " and then <name> and i can drive around to mr. <unk> <unk> . "
this was agreeable to <name> and <name> , and in a few minutes the girls were left at the door of the establishment where <name> had said she wished to match some ribbon .
then the two boys started for the <unk> 's shop .
<name> had already acquainted <name> with the particulars of his errand to the place .
" what are you going to do if wecks says you really had the shoes ? "
questioned the son of the real estate dealer , when they were on the way to the shoe store .
" but how can he say that when i have n't been near the place , <name> ? "
returned <name> .
" i do n't know .
but i do know that people have sometimes had things charged to them at the stores which other people got . "
" humph !
well , i sha'n't pay for any shoes that i did not get , " answered our hero , simply .
mr. wecks 's establishment was at the far end of the main street of coburntown ; so the lads had half a dozen blocks to cover before they reached the place .
" hello , it 's closed ! "
exclaimed <name> , as they came in sight of the store ; and he nodded in the direction of the show window , the curtain of which was drawn down .
the curtain on the door was also down , and on the glass was pasted a sheet of note paper .
" some sort of notice .
i 'll see what it is , " answered <name> , and , throwing the reins to <name> , he left the sleigh .
soon he was reading what was written on the sheet of paper : closed on account of death in the family. <name> wecks .
" somebody dead .
that 's too bad ! "
mused <name> .
" i wonder who it can be ? "
and then he passed into a barber shop next door to find out .
" it 's mr. wecks 's father  a very old man who lived back in the country from here , " explained the barber .
" mr. wecks went up there last night , and he does n't expect to come back until after the funeral , which <name> probably be day after to-morrow . "
" i do n't suppose his clerk is around ? "
questioned <name> .
" no .
the funeral gave him a holiday , and he was glad of it .
he 's out of town , too ; " and having thus expressed himself , the barber turned to wait upon a customer who had just come in , and <name> returned to the sleigh .
" if that 's the case , you 'll have to let the matter rest until the next time you come to coburntown , or else you 'll have to write to mr. wecks , " said <name> .
" i 'll be coming over again before very long , " answered <name> .
" but , just the same , i 'd like to have this matter settled . "
while <name> was speaking to his chum a man passed him on the sidewalk , looking at him rather fixedly .
this man was mr. <name> dickley , the proprietor of the largest gentlemen 's furnishing establishment of which coburntown boasted .
our hero knew the man fairly well , having purchased a number of things at his place from time to time , and so he nodded pleasantly .
mr. <name> dickley nodded in return , but with a rather sour expression on his face .
then he glanced at <name> , and at the handsome sleigh and still more stylish team of horses , and passed on muttering something to himself .
" mr. dickley did n't look very happy , " was <name> 's comment , as he and <name> entered the sleigh .
" i do n't think he likes my father very much , " answered the son of the real estate dealer .
" he wanted to get a piece of property here very cheap , and my father found another customer for the place at five hundred dollars more . "
" i see , <name> .
just the same , why should he give me such a hard look ?
of course , i have n't been in his place of business for a good while .
but he ca n't expect me to buy all my furnishing goods from him . "
" well , you know how it is , <name>  when you buy some things from some storekeepers they think they are entitled to your whole trade .
however , i should n't let the matter worry me . "
" not much !
i 've got other things to think about .
do n't forget that i expect next month to take that examination in civil engineering .
that 's what is on my mind just now . "
" oh , you 'll pass , do n't worry , <name> .
just think of what a brilliant showing you made at oak hall . "
" true .
but my studies in civil engineering have been a good deal harder than anything i tackled at school .
if it was n't for mr. ramsdell , the old civil engineer who is <unk> <name> and me , i don't know how i would possibly have gotten along . "
" if you pass the examination , what <name> you do next ? "
" <name> and i <name> go out on some constructive work and thus get a taste of real engineering .
mr. ramsdell thinks he can get us positions with the mentor construction company of philadelphia , who are now doing a good deal of work in texas  laying out railroads and building bridges . "
" in texas ?
say !
that 's quite a distance from here . "
" so it is , <name> .
but it is not as far as i expect to get some day .
if i ever make anything of civil engineering i <name> some day to be able to do some great work in other parts of the world  maybe in mexico or south <name> . "
" say , that <name> be great ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically .
" you 'll have a fine chance to see the world .
you must take after your uncle , <name> .
he was always a great fellow to travel .
think of how you located him years ago away down on that island in the south seas ! "
" it sure was a great trip !
and some day i 'd like to take it over again .
but just now i 've got to put in all my time on this civil engineering proposition .
i think i 'll be lucky if i pass and get that chance to go to texas . "
chapter iv <name> porton again a quarter of an hour later the girls had finished their shopping and rejoined the boys .
then it was decided that the party should go on to <name> , six miles farther .
they were told that the road was in excellent condition , and this proved to be a fact , so that the sleighing was thoroughly enjoyed .
it was growing dark when they drove down the main street of <name> , and , although a bit early , all agreed to <name> 's suggestion that they get dinner at the leading restaurant  a place at which they had stopped a number of times and which they knew to be first-class .
" what a pity <name> could n't come along , " said <name> to <name> just before sitting down to the sumptuous meal which the boys had ordered .
" i know he would have enjoyed this very much . "
" no doubt of it , <name> , " answered <name> , who well knew what a fondness for his sister the senator 's son possessed .
" but , as you know , <name> had to go home on a business matter for his father .
senator morr is very busy in washington these days , so <name> has to take care of quite a few matters at home . "
" is n't it queer that he does n't want to follow in the footsteps of his father and take up politics ? "
went on the girl .
" senator morr did n't want him to do it .
and , besides , <name> has no taste that way .
he loves civil engineering just as much as i do . "
" it 's a wonder you and he did n't persuade <name> <name> to take it up , too , <name> . "
" oh , <name> could n't do that .
you know his father 's shipping interests are very large , and mr. <name> wants <name> to take hold with him  and <name> likes that sort of thing .
he is planning right now to take several trips on his father 's ships this summer . "
" when does that examination of yours come off , <name> ? "
" about the middle of next month . "
" and if you really pass , are you going to work away down in texas ? "
continued the girl , anxiously .
" if i can get the position ,  and if <name> is willing to go along . "
" i do n't like to have you go so far away ; " and <name> pouted a little .
" well , it ca n't be helped .
if i want to be a civil engineer i 've got to take an opening where i can get it .
besides , mr. ramsdell thinks it <name> be the best kind of training for <name> and me .
he knows the men at the head of the mentor company , and <name> get them to give us every opportunity to advance ourselves .
that , you know , <name> mean a great deal . "
" oh , but texas , <name> !
why , that is thousands of miles away ! "
" not so very many thousands , <name> , " he answered with a little smile .
" the mails run regularly , and i trust you <name> not forget how to write letters .
besides that , i do n't expect to stay in texas forever . "
" yes , but when you come back from texas , you 'll be going off to some other far-away place  south <name> , or africa , or the north pole , or somewhere , " and <name> pouted again .
" oh , say , let up !
i 'm not going to south africa , or to the north pole either .
of course , i may go to mexico or south <name> , or to the far west .
but that wo n't be so very soon .
it <name> be after i have had considerable experience in civil engineering , and when i am older than i am now .
and you know what sometimes happens to a fellow when he gets older ? "
" what ? "
" he gets married . "
" oh , indeed ! "
<name> blushed a little .
" and then i suppose he goes off and leaves his wife behind and forgets all about her . "
" does he ?
not so as you can notice it !
he takes his wife with him  that is , provided she <name> go . "
" oh , the idea ! "
and now , as <name> looked her steadily in the eyes , <name> blushed more than ever .
where this conversation would have ended it is impossible to say , but at that moment <name> interrupted the pair , followed by <name> ; and then the talk became general as the four sat down to dinner .
the horses had been put up in a stable connected with the restaurant , and after the meal it was <name> who went out to get them and bring them around to the front of the place .
he was just driving to the street when his glance fell upon a person standing in the glare of an electric light .
the person had his face turned full toward our hero , so that <name> got a good look at him .
" <name> porton ! "
cried the youth in astonishment .
" how in the world did that fellow get here , and what is he doing ? "
like a flash the memory of the past came over <name>  how <name> porton had tried to pass himself off as the real <name> <name> and thus <unk> <name> himself back to the ranks of the " <unk> . "
<name> was crossing the sidewalk at the time , but as soon as he had the team and the sleigh in the street he jumped out and made his way towards the other youth .
" i think i 'll interview him and see what he has to say for himself , " murmured <name> to himself .
" maybe i 'll have him arrested . "
<name> porton had been staring at our hero all the while he was turning into the street and getting out of the sleigh .
but now , as he saw <name> approaching , he started to walk away .
" stop , porton !
i want to talk to you , " called out our hero .
" stop ! "
" i do n't want to see you , " returned the other youth , hastily .
" you let me alone ; " and then , as <name> came closer , he suddenly broke into a run down the street .
<name> was taken by surprise , but only for a moment .
then he , too , commenced to run , doing his best to catch the fellow ahead .
but <name> porton was evidently scared .
he looked back , and , seeing <name> running , increased his speed , and then shot around a corner and into an alleyway .
when <name> reached the corner he was nowhere in sight .
" he certainly was scared , " was <name> 's mental comment , as he looked up and down the side street and even glanced into the alleyway .
" i wonder where he went and if it would do any good to look any further for him ? "
<name> spent fully five minutes in that vicinity , but without being able to discover <name> porton 's hiding-place .
then , knowing that the others would be wondering what had become of him , and being also afraid that the grays might run away again , he returned to where he had left the sleigh standing .
" hello !
where did you go ? "
called out <name> , who had just emerged from the restaurant .
" what do you think ?
i just saw that rascal , <name> porton ! "
burst out <name> .
" porton !
you do n't mean it ?
where is he ? "
" he was standing under that light when i drove out from the stable .
i ran to speak to him , and then he took to his legs and <unk> around yonder corner .
i went after him , but by the time i got on the side street he was out of sight . "
" is that so !
it 's too bad you could n't catch him , <name> .
i suppose you would have liked to talk to him . "
" that 's right , <name> .
and maybe i might have had him arrested , although now that he has been exposed , and now that link merwell is in jail , i do n't suppose it would have done much good . "
" it 's queer he should show himself so close to crumville .
one would think that he would want to put all the distance possible between himself and your folks . "
" that 's true , <name> .
maybe he is up to some more of his tricks . "
the girls were on the lookout for the boys , and now , having bundled up well , they came from the restaurant , and all got into the sleigh once more .
then they turned back in the direction of crumville , this time , however , taking a route which did not go near <unk> 's hill .
" oh , <name> !
were you sure it was that <name> porton ? "
questioned his sister , when he had told her and <name> about the appearance of the former moving-picture actor .
" i was positive .
besides , if it was n't porton , why would he run away ? "
" i sincerely <name> he does n't try to do you any harm , <name> , " said <name> , and gave a little shiver .
" i was hoping we had seen the last of that horrid young man . "
" why , <name> !
you would n't call him horrid , would you , when he looks so very much like <name> ? "
asked <name> , mischievously .
" he does n't look very much like <name> , " returned the girl , quickly .
" and he does n't act in the least like him , " she added loyally .
" it 's mighty queer to have a double that way , " was the comment of the real estate man 's son .
" i do n't know that i should like to have somebody else looking like me . "
" if you could n't help it , you 'd have to put up with it , " returned <name> , briefly .
and then he changed the subject , which , as the others could plainly see , was distasteful to him .
as they left <name> the moon came up over a patch of woods , flooding the snowy roadway with subdued light .
in spite of what had happened , all of the young folks were in good spirits , and they were soon laughing and chatting gaily .
<name> started to sing one of the old oak hall favorites , and <name> and the girls joined in .
the grays were now behaving themselves , and trotted along as steadily as could be desired .
when the <unk> reached crumville they left <name> basswood at his door , and then went on to the wadsworth mansion .
" did you have a fine ride ? "
inquired mrs. wadsworth , when the young folks bustled into the house .
" oh , it was splendid , mamma ! "
cried her daughter .
" coming back in the moonlight was just the nicest ever ! "
" did those grays behave themselves ? "
questioned mr. wadsworth , who was present .
" <name> said they acted rather frisky when he brought them out . "
" oh , they were pretty frisky at first , " returned <name> .
" but i finally managed to get them to calm down , " he added .
the matter had been discussed by the young folks , and it had been decided not to say anything about the runaway unless it was necessary .
on the following morning <name> had to apply himself diligently to his studies .
since leaving oak hall he had been attending a civil engineering class in the city with <name> , and had , in addition , been taking private <unk> from a mr. ramsdell , a retired civil engineer of considerable reputation , who , in years gone by , had been a college friend of <name> 's father .
<name> was exceedingly anxious to make as good a showing as possible at the coming examinations .
" here are several letters for you , <name> , " said old mr. potts to him late that afternoon , as he entered the boy 's study with the mail .
" you seem to be the lucky one , " the retired professor continued , with a smile .
" all i 've got is a <name> . "
" maybe there is a <name> here for me , professor , " returned <name> gaily , as he took the <unk> handed out .
<name> glanced at the envelopes .
by the <unk> he knew that one letter was from <name> <name> and another from shadow hamilton , one of his old oak hall chums , and a fellow who loved to tell stories .
the third communication was <unk> coburntown , and in a corner of the envelope had the <unk> of <name> dickley .
" hello !
i wonder what mr. dickley wants of me , " <name> mused , as he turned the letter over .
then he remembered how sour the store-keeper had appeared when they had met the day before .
" maybe he wants to know why i have n't bought anything from him lately . "
<name> tore open the communication which was written on one of <name> dickley 's <unk> .
the letter ran as follows : " mr. <name> <name> .
" dear sir : " i thought when i saw you in coburntown to-day that you would come in and see me ; but you did not .
<name> you kindly let me know why you do not settle up as promised ?
when i let you have the goods , you said you would settle up by the end of the week without fail .
unless you come in and settle up inside of the next week i shall have to call the attention of your father to what you owe me .
" yours truly , " <name> dickley . "
chapter v what <name> dickley had to say <name> read the letter received from mr. <name> dickley with much interest .
he went over it twice , and as he did so the second time his mind reverted to the communication received the morning before from mr. wecks .
" what in the world does mr. dickley mean by writing to me in this fashion ? "
he mused .
" i have n't had anything from him in a long while , and i do n't owe him a cent .
it certainly is a mighty strange proceeding , to say the least . "
then like a flash another thought came into his mind  was <name> porton connected in any way with this affair ?
" somebody must have gotten some things in my name from mr. dickley , and he must have gotten those shoes from mr. wecks , too .
if the party went there in person and said he was <name> <name> , i do n't think it could have been any one but <name> porton , because , so far as i know , he 's the only fellow that resembles me . "
our hero was so much worried that he gave scant attention to the letters received from <name> <name> and shadow hamilton , even though those communications contained many matters of interest .
he was looking at the dickley communication for a third time when his sister entered .
" well , <name> , no more bad news i <name> ? "
said <name> , with a smile .
" it is bad news , " he returned .
" just read that ; " and he turned the letter over to her .
" if you owe mr. dickley any money you ought to pay him , " said the sister , after perusing the epistle .
" i do n't think father would like it if he knew you were running into debt , " and she gazed anxiously at <name> .
" <name> !
you ought to know me better than that , " he answered somewhat shortly .
" i never run any bills unless i am able to pay them .
but this is something different .
it is in the same line with the one i got from mr. wecks .
i did n't get his shoes , and i have n't gotten anything from mr. dickley for a long time , and nothing at all that i have n't paid for . "
" oh , <name> !
do you mean it ? "
and now <name> 's face took on a look of worry .
" why , somebody must be playing a trick on you ! "
" if he is , it 's a mighty mean trick , <name> .
but i think it is more than a trick .
i think it is a swindle . "
" swindle ? "
" exactly .
and what is more , do you know who i think is guilty ? "
" why , who could be guilty ? "
the sister paused for a moment to look at her brother .
" oh , <name> !
could it be that awful <name> porton ? "
" that 's the fellow i fasten on .
did n't we meet him in <name> ?
and that 's only six miles from coburntown .
more than likely that rascal has been hanging around here , and maybe getting a whole lot of things in my name . "
<name> began to pace the floor .
" it 's a shame !
if i could get hold of him i think i would have him locked up . "
" what are you going to do about this letter ? "
" i 'm going to go to coburntown the first chance i get and tell mr. dickley , and also mr. wecks , the truth .
i want to find out whether the party who got those things procured them in person or on some written order .
if he got them on a written order , somebody must have forged my name . "
" had n't you better tell father or uncle dunston about this ? "
" not just yet , <name> .
it <name> be time enough to worry them after i have seen mr. wecks and mr. dickley .
perhaps i can settle the matter myself . "
<name> was so upset that it was hard for him to buckle down to his studies ; and he was glad that evening when an interruption came in the shape of the arrival of his old school chum and fellow engineering student , <name> morr .
" back again !
and right side up with care ! "
announced the senator's son , as he came in and shook hands .
" my !
but i 've had a busy time since i 've been away ! "
he replied in answer to a question of <name> 's .
" i had to settle up one or two things for father , and then i had to go on half a dozen different errands for mother , and then see to it that i got those new text books that mr. ramsdell spoke about .
i got two copies of each , <name> , and here are those that are coming to you , " and he passed over three small volumes .
" and that is n't all .
i just met <name> basswood at the depot where he was sending a telegram to his father , who is in chicago .
<name> had some wonderful news to tell . "
" what was that ? "
asked <name> and <name> simultaneously .
" he did n't give me any of the particulars , but it seems an old friend of theirs died out in chicago recently , and mr. basswood was sent for by some lawyers to help settle the estate . "
" yes , we know that much , " broke in <name> .
" but what 's the new news ? "
" why , it seems this man , enos , died quite wealthy , and he left almost his entire estate to mr .
basswood . "
" is that so ! "
cried <name> .
" that sure is fine !
i do n't know of anybody who deserves money more than do the <unk> , " and his face lit up with genuine pleasure .
" it <name> be nice for <name> , " said <name> , " and even nicer for mrs. basswood .
mamma says there was a time when they were quite poor , and mrs. basswood had to do all her own work .
now they 'll be able to take it easy . "
" oh , they are far from poor , " returned <name> .
" they 've been living on <unk> street , ' as the saying goes , for a number of years .
just the same , it <name> be a fine thing for them to get this fortune . "
" there was one thing about the news that <name> did n't understand , " continued <name> .
" his father telegraphed that the estate was a decidedly curious one , and that was why the lawyers wanted him to come to chicago immediately .
he added that mr. enos had proved to be a very eccentric individual . "
" maybe he was as eccentric as that man in rhode island i once read about , " said <name> , with a grin .
" when he died he left an estate consisting of about twelve thousand ducks .
this estate went to two worthless nephews , who knew nothing at all about their uncle's business .
and , as somebody said , the two nephews very soon made <unk> and <unk> ' of the whole fortune . "
" oh , what a story ! "
cried <name> , laughing .
" twelve thousand ducks !
what ever would a person do with them ? "
" why , some duck farms are very profitable , " returned <name> .
" you do n't suppose this mr. enos left such a fortune as that to mr .
basswood ? "
queried <name> .
" i 'm sure i do n't know what the fortune consists of .
and neither did <name> .
he was tremendously curious to know .
and he said his mother could hardly wait until mr. basswood sent additional information , " replied <name> .
" <name> told me that this mr. enos was once a partner of his father in business , the two running an <name> store together .
enos was very much interested in <name> ; so it 's possible the fortune he left may have something to do with that , " added <name> .
as my old readers know , <name> morr had always thought a great deal of <name> ; and of late his liking for her had greatly increased .
on her part , <name> 's sister had always considered the senator 's son a very promising young man .
consequently , it can well be imagined that the four young people spent a most enjoyable time that evening in the mansion .
the girls played on the piano and all sang , and then some rugs were pushed aside , a phonograph was brought into action , and they danced a number of the latest steps , with the older folks looking on .
<name> was to remain over for several days at crumville , and early the next morning <name> asked his chum if he would accompany him on a hasty trip to coburntown .
he had already acquainted <name> with the trouble he was having with the <unk> and the man who sold men's <unk> .
" we can take a horse and cutter and be back before lunch , " said <name> .
" i 'll be glad to go , " answered the senator 's son .
" i have n't had a ride in a cutter this <name> . "
they were soon on the way , <name> this time driving a black horse that could not only cover the ground well , but was thoroughly reliable .
by ten o'clock they found themselves in coburntown , and made their way to the establishment run by <name> dickley .
the proprietor of the store was busy with a customer at the time , and a clerk came forward to wait on the new arrivals .
" i wish to speak to mr. dickley , " said <name> ; and he and <name> waited until the man was at leisure .
mr. dickley looked anything but pleasant as he walked up to our hero .
" i got a very strange letter from you , mr. dickley .
i ca n't understand it at all , " began <name> .
" and i ca n't understand why you treat me the way you do , " blurted out the shopkeeper .
" you promised to come in here and settle up over a week ago . "
" mr. dickley , i think there is a big mistake somewhere , " said <name> , as calmly as he could .
" i do n't owe you any money , and i ca n't understand why you should write me such a letter as this , " and he brought forth the communication he had received .
" you do n't owe me any money ! "
ejaculated <name> dickley .
" i just guess you do !
you owe me twenty-six dollars . "
" twenty-six dollars ! "
repeated <name> .
" what is that for ? "
" for ?
you know as well as i do !
did n't you come in here and get a <unk> hat , some shirts and collars and neckties , and a pair of <unk> gloves , and a lot of underwear ?
the whole <name> came to just twenty-six dollars . "
" and when was this stuff purchased ? "
went on <name> .
" when was it purchased ?
see here , <name> , what sort of <unk> is this ? "
cried <name> dickley .
" you know as well as i do when you got the things .
i would n't be so harsh with you , only you promised me faithfully that you would come in and settle up long before this . "
" mr. dickley , i have n't had any goods from you for a long , long time  and what i have had i have paid for , " answered <name> , doing his best to keep his temper , because he knew the storekeeper must be laboring under a mistake .
" as a matter of fact , i have n't been in your store for several months . "
" what ! "
ejaculated the storekeeper .
" do you mean to deny that you bought those goods from me , young man ? "
" i certainly do deny it .
as i said before , i have n't been in this store for several months . "
at this plain declaration made by <name> , mr. <name> dickley grew fairly purple .
he leaned over his counter and shook his clenched fist in <name> 's face .
" so that is the way you are going to try to swindle me out of my money , is it , <name> <name> ? "
he cried .
" well , let me tell you , it won't work .
you came here and got those goods from me , and either you'll pay for them or i 'll <name> your father for the amount .
why , it's preposterous ! "
the storekeeper turned to his clerk , who was gazing on the scene in open-mouthed wonder .
" here a customer comes in and buys a lot of goods and i am good-hearted enough to trust him to the amount , twenty-six dollars , and then he comes here and declares to my face that he never had the things and he wo n't pay for them .
now what do you think of that , <unk> ? "
" i think it 's pretty raw , " responded the clerk .
" were n't you in the shop when i let <name> have some of those goods ? "
" i certainly was , " answered <unk> .
" of course , i was in the rear , sorting out those new goods that had come in , so i did n't see just what you let him have ; but i certainly know he got some things . "
" mr. dickley , now listen to me for a minute , " said <name> in a tone of voice that arrested the man 's attention in spite of his <unk> .
" look at me closely .
did n't the fellow who got those things from you look somewhat different from me ? "
<name> faced the storekeeper with unflinching eyes , and <name> dickley was compelled to look the youth over carefully .
as he did this the positive expression on his face gradually changed to one of doubt .
" why , i  er  of course , he looked like you , " he stammered .
" of course you can change your looks a little ; but that do n't count with me .
besides , did n't you give me your name as <name> <name> , and ask me if i did n't remember you ? "
" the fellow who got those goods may have done all that , mr. dickley .
but that fellow was not i. i may be mistaken , but i think it was a young man who resembles me , and who some time ago made a great deal of trouble for me . "
" humph !
that 's a fishy kind of story , <name> .
if there is such a person he must look very much like you . "
" he does .
in fact , some people declare they can hardly tell us apart . "
" what 's the name of that fellow ? "
" <name> porton . "
" does he live around here ? "
" i do n't know where he is living just at present .
but i saw him day before yesterday in <name> .
i tried to stop him , but he ran away from me . "
the storekeeper gazed at <name> for a moment in silence , and then pursed up his lips and shook his head decidedly .
" that is too much of a fish story for me to swallow , " he said harshly .
" you 'll either have to bring that young man here and prove that he got the goods , or else you 'll have to pay for them yourself . "
chapter <name> more trouble <name> and <name> spent the best part of half an hour in <name> <unk> store , and during that time our hero and his chum gave the particulars of how they had become acquainted with <name> porton , and how the young moving-picture actor had tried to pass himself off as the real <name> <name> , and how he had been exposed and had disappeared .
" well , if what you say is true i 've been swindled , " declared the storekeeper finally .
" i 'd like to get my hands on that young man . "
" you would n't like it any better than i would , " returned <name> , grimly .
" you see , i do n't know how far this thing extends .
mr. wecks has been after me to pay for some shoes that i never got . "
" say , that moving-picture actor must be a <name> ! "
declared the storekeeper 's clerk , <unk> .
" if you do n't watch out , <name> , he'll get you into all kinds of hot water . "
" i think the best you can do , <name> , is to notify the storekeepers you do business with to be on the lookout for porton , " suggested <name> .
" then , if he shows up again , they can have him held until you arrive . "
" i 'll certainly have to do something , " answered <name> .
" then i suppose you do n't want to settle that <name> ? "
came from <name> dickley , wistfully .
" no , sir .
and i do n't think you ought to expect it . "
" well , i do n't know .
the fellow who got those goods said he was <name> <name> , " vouchsafed the storekeeper doggedly .
from <name> dickley 's establishment <name> , accompanied by his chum , drove around to the store kept by mr. wecks .
he found the curtains still down , but the <unk> had just come in , and was at his desk writing letters .
" and you mean to say you did n't get those shoes ? "
questioned mr. wecks with interest , after <name> had explained the situation .
" that 's mighty curious .
i never had a thing like that happen before . "
he knew our hero well , and trusted <name> implicitly .
" i should n't have sent that letter only i had a chance to sell a pair of shoes that size , and i thought if you had made your selection i could sell the pair you did n't want to the other fellow . "
once again the two boys had to tell all about <name> porton and what that young rascal was supposed to be doing .
as they proceeded mr. wecks 's face took on a look of added intelligence .
" exactly !
exactly !
that fits in with what i thought when that fellow went off with the shoes , " he declared finally .
" i said to myself , <unk> <name> <name> looks different to-day .
he must have had a spell of sickness or something . '
that other chap was a bit thinner and paler than you are . "
" he 's a regular cigarette fiend , and that is , i think , what makes him look pale , " put in <name> .
and then he added quickly : " do you remember  was he smoking ? "
" yes , he was .
he threw a cigarette <unk> away while he was trying on the shoes , and then lit another cigarette when he was going out .
i thought at the time that he was probably smoking more than was good for him . "
" i do n't smoke at all , and never have done so , " said <name> .
he turned to his chum .
" i think the fact that the fellow who got the shoes was smoking is additional proof that it was porton . "
" i have n't the slightest idea that it was anybody else , " answered the senator 's son .
mr. wecks promised to keep on the lookout for <name> porton , in case that individual showed himself again , and then <name> and <name> left .
" i 'm going into all the stores where i do business and tell the folks to be on the watch for <name> porton , " said our hero .
" a good idea , <name> .
but see here !
how are they going to tell him from you ? "
and the senator 's son chuckled .
" you may come along some day and they may hold you , thinking you are porton . "
" i thought of that , <name> , and i 'll leave each of them my signature on a card .
i know that <name> porton does n't write as i do . "
this idea was followed out , the boys spending the best part of an hour in going around coburntown .
then they drove back to crumville , and there <name> visited some other establishments with which he was in the habit of doing business .
all the storekeepers were much interested in what he had to tell , and all readily agreed to have <name> porton detained if he should show himself .
at each place <name> left his signature , so that there might be no further mistake regarding his identity .
after that several days passed quietly .
both <name> and <name> were applying themselves to their studies , and as a consequence saw little of <name> except in the evenings , when all the young folks would get together for more or less of a good time .
" any more news about that fortune in chicago ? "
asked <name> , one evening of the basswood lad .
" not very much , " answered <name> .
" father telegraphed that he was hunting for some things that belonged to mr. enos .
he said that as soon as he found them he would tell us all about it . "
" that certainly is a strange state of affairs . "
" strange ?
i should say it was ! "
cried the other .
" mother and i are just dying to know what it all means .
one thing is certain  mr. enos did not leave his fortune in stocks or bonds or real estate , or anything like that . "
on the following day came additional trouble for <name> in the shape of a communication from a hotel-keeper in coburntown .
he stated that he had heard through <name> dickley that <name> was having trouble with a party who was <unk> him , and added that a person calling himself <name> <name> was owing him a <name> of fifteen dollars for five days ' board .
" is n't this the limit ? "
cried <name> , as he showed the letter to his father and his uncle dunston .
" no use in talking , <name> , we 'll have to get after that rascal , " announced the father .
" if we do n't , there is no telling how far he'll <name> this thing .
i think i 'll put the authorities on his track . "
two days after that , and while <name> was continuing his studies as diligently as ever , came word over the telephone from <name> .
" is this you , <name> <name> ? "
came over the wire .
" yes , " answered our hero .
" who are you ? "
" this is nat poole talking .
i am up here in <name>  in the first national bank .
you know my father got me a job here last week . "
" no , i did n't know it , nat .
but i 'm glad to hear you have something to do , and i <name> you 'll make a success of it , " returned <name> promptly .
" i called you up to find out if you were in <name> , " continued the son of the money <unk> .
" i wanted to make sure of it . "
" well , i 'm not .
i 'm right here at home , nat . "
" then , in that case , i want to tell you that the fellow who looks like you is here . "
" where do you mean  in the bank ? "
" well , he came in here to get a five-dollar <name> changed .
i happened to see him as he was going out and i called to him , thinking it was you .
when i called he seemed to get scared , and he got out in a hurry .
then i happened to think about that fellow who looked like you , and i made up my mind i 'd call you up . "
" how long ago since he was in the bank ? "
questioned <name> , eagerly .
" not more than ten minutes ago .
i tried to get you sooner but the wire was busy . "
" you have n't any idea where he went ? "
" no , except that he started down the side street next to the bank , which , as maybe you know , runs towards the river . "
" all right , nat .
thank you very much for what you 've told me .
i want to locate that fellow if i possibly can .
he is a swindler , and if you clap eyes on him again have him arrested , " added <name> ; and this nat poole promised to do .
the news over the wire excited <name> not a little .
of the men of the household , only old professor potts was in , and he , of course , could not assist in the matter .
<name> at once sought out mrs. wadsworth and told her of what he had heard .
" i think i 'll drive to <name> and see if i can locate porton , " he added .
" <name> says he <name> go with me . "
" do as you think best , <name> , " answered the <name> of the house .
" but do keep out of trouble !
this <name> porton may prove to be a dangerous character if you attempt to corner him . "
" i think <name> and i can manage him , if only we can find him , " returned the youth .
once more the black horse and the cutter were brought into service , and the two youths made the best possible time on the snowy highway that led through coburntown to <name> .
arriving there , they called at the bank and interviewed nat poole .
" if what you say about porton is true he certainly must be a bad one  almost as bad as merwell and jasniff , " was the comment of the money <unk> 's son .
" i certainly <name> you spot him and bring him to book .
that 's the way he went the last i saw of him , " he added , pointing down the side street .
<name> and <name> drove down the street looking to the right and the left for a possible sight of <name> porton .
but their search was doomed to disappointment for the moving-picture actor was nowhere to be seen .
" it 's a good deal like looking for a needle in a haystack , " was the comment of the senator 's son , after a full hour had been spent in the hunt .
they had left the sleigh and had walked around a number of mills and tenement houses which were situated in that locality .
" i 've got an idea , " said <name> , as several children approached them .
" i 'm going to ask the youngsters if they 've seen a young man who looks like me . "
the first boys and girls to whom the subject was broached shook their heads and declared they had seen nobody that resembled <name> .
then our hero and his chum passed on to other children , and finally to some men working around a <unk> tenement .
" why sure !
i saw a young feller wot looked like you , " said a youth who was piling up some lumber .
" he <unk> me fer a match .
say !
he looked like he could have been your twin , " he added in wonder ; and then continued suddenly : " maybe <unk> is playin ' a trick on me , and it was <unk> got the match ? "
" no , i never met you before , " answered <name> , quickly .
" when did you meet the other fellow , and where ?
i am very anxious to locate him . "
" it was down on de bridge , about an hour ago .
i was comin ' dis way , and he was goin ' de udder way . "
" was he smoking a cigarette ? "
asked <name> .
" he had one o ' de <unk> in his hand and he lit up after i given him de match . "
" did he say anything ? "
questioned our hero .
the carpenter 's helper scratched his head for a moment .
" sure he did !
he <unk> me if it was putty good walkin ' to <unk> .
i told him <unk> fair , ' and den he went on and i came here . "
" then he must have gone on to <unk> ! "
cried <name> .
" how far is that from here ? "
" about two miles and a half , " answered <name> .
he turned to the carpenter 's helper .
" much obliged to you . "
" dat 's all right .
say !
but dat <name> certainly looks like you , " the carpenter 's helper added , with a grin .
" come , we 'll follow him , " said <name> to his chum , and led the way on the run to where the horse was tied .
soon they were in the cutter once more .
<name> urged the black along at his best speed , and over the bridge they flew , and then along the road leading to the village of <unk> .
chapter vii face to face " if you catch porton , <name> , what <name> you do  turn him over to the authorities ? "
" yes , <name> . "
" is <unk> much of a place ? "
" oh , no .
there are but two stores and two churches and not over thirty or forty houses . "
" then you may have some trouble in finding an officer .
probably the village does n't boast of anything more than a constable and a justice of the peace . "
" i am not worrying about that yet , <name> , " returned our hero , grimly .
" we have got to catch porton first . "
" oh , i know that .
but if he started for <unk> on foot we ought to be able to locate him .
a stranger ca n't go through such a small place without somebody 's noticing it . "
on and on trotted the horse , past many well-kept farms , and then through a small patch of timber land .
beyond the woods they crossed a frozen creek , and then made a turn to the northward .
a short distance beyond they came in sight of the first houses that went to make up the village of <unk> .
" well , we 've not seen anything of him yet , " remarked the senator's son , as they slowed up and looked ahead and to both sides of the village street .
" no , and i do n't understand it , " returned <name> .
" from what that carpenter 's helper said , i thought we should overtake him before we got to <unk> .
either he must have left this road , or else he must be some <name> . "
" i do n't see where he could have gone if he left the road , <name> .
all we passed were lanes leading to the farms , and a path through that wood .
it is n't likely he would take to the woods in this cold weather  not unless he was going hunting , and that chap back in <name> did n't say anything about his carrying a gun . "
with the horse in a walk , they passed down the village street and back again .
as they did this they kept their eyes wide open , peering into the various yards and lanes that presented themselves .
" i 'm afraid it 's no use unless he is in one of these houses or in one of the stores , " was <name> 's comment .
" i 'll ask at the stores , " returned <name> .
the inquiries he and his chum made were productive of no results so far as locating <name> porton was concerned .
no one had seen or heard of the former moving picture actor .
" all the strangers we 've seen to-day was a cigar drummer , " said one of the shopkeepers .
" and he was a fat man and about forty years old . "
the other storekeeper had had no strangers in his place .
hardly knowing what to do next , <name> and <name> returned to the cutter .
" maybe he went farther than this , " suggested <name> .
" we might go on a mile or two and take a look . "
now that they had come so far , <name> thought this a good idea , and so they passed on for a distance of nearly two miles beyond <unk> .
here the sleighing became poor , there being but few farmhouses in that vicinity .
" it 's no use , " said <name> , finally .
" we 'll go back to <unk> , take another look around , and then return to <name> and home . "
when they arrived once more at the village <name> suggested that he and his chum separate .
" there are a number of these lanes that lead to some back roads , " said <name> .
" perhaps if we tramp around on foot and ask some of the country folks living around here we may get on the track of the fellow we are after . "
the senator 's son was willing , and he was soon walking down a <name> leading to the right while <name> went off to the left .
presently <name> came to a barn where a farmer was mending some broken harness .
" hello !
back again , are you ? "
cried the farmer , as he looked at <name> curiously .
" what brought you ?
why did n't you stop when i called to you before ? "
" i guess you 're just the man i want to see , " cried <name> , quickly .
and then , as the farmer looked at him in increasing wonder , he added : " did a young man who looks very much like me go past here to-day ? "
" look like you ? "
queried the farmer .
" why , it was you , was n't it ? "
" no .
it must have been a fellow who resembles me very closely .
i am trying to catch him . "
" well , i swan ! "
murmured the farmer , looking at <name> critically .
" that other feller looked as much like you as could be .
wot is he  your twin brother ? "
" i am thankful to say he is no relative of mine .
he is a swindler , and that is why i would like to catch him .
he has been getting goods in my name .
if he went past here perhaps you can tell me where he has gone ? "
" he walked past here less than fifteen minutes ago .
he went down that <name> , which is a short cut to the road to <unk> . "
" <unk> ! "
cried our hero .
" that 's the railroad station up this way , is n't it ? "
" yes . "
" then he must be heading for a railroad train ! "
exclaimed <name> , quickly .
" how far is it from here ? "
" <unk> is three miles by the road , but it 's less than a mile and a quarter by that short cut through <name> 's woods . "
" then i 'll go after him by that short cut , " answered <name> .
he thought for a moment .
to hunt up <name> and get him to go along might take too long .
he looked at the farmer .
" would you like to go with me ?
i'll make it worth your while , " he continued .
" sorry , but i ca n't do it , " was the reply .
" i 've got to meet the man who buys my milk down town in about fifteen minutes .
he 's a very particular customer , and if i should fail him he might get mad .
so i ca n't go . "
" all right , i 'll go after him alone , " answered our hero ; and then continued : " if you are going down town , and you chance to see a friend of mine with my black horse and cutter , <name> you kindly tell him where i have gone ? "
" sure , i <name> ; " and with this promise from the farmer <name> started on a swift walk along the short cut to <unk> which the other had pointed out .
fortunately for the youth , to keep his feet warm while riding he had donned a heavy pair of <unk> , so that walking through the rather deep snow of the path leading through the back farms and through <name> 's woods was not as uncomfortable as it might otherwise have been .
to be sure , he occasionally found himself floundering in snow that was over his <unk> , but when this happened he simply smiled grimly and made the best of it .
when at oak hall he had often taken part in track athletics , <unk> running , and occasionally in a game of hare and hounds , and consequently his wind was good and he made rapid progress without becoming too much exhausted .
he was in the depth of the woods when , at a turn in the path , he saw a figure ahead of him .
the individual wore a heavy overcoat and had a cap pulled well down over his ears and the back of his head .
" i may be mistaken , but that looks as if it might be porton , " said <name> to himself .
" however , i 'll soon know ; " and he increased his speed so that he might catch up to the other <name> .
as the ground was covered with snow our hero made but slight noise while he advanced , and as a consequence he <name> quite close to the other individual before the latter was aware of his presence .
" hi there ! "
called out <name> , when he was but a few feet behind .
the fellow had stopped and turned around , and a single glance showed our hero that it was the youth he was seeking .
" <name> <name> ! "
muttered <name> porton , as he recognized our hero .
his manner showed that he was much astonished , as well as chagrined , at this unexpected meeting .
" you did n't expect to meet me out here , did you ? "
remarked <name> , sharply , as he came up alongside the former moving-picture actor .
" why  i  er  i  ca n't  ca n't say that i did , " returned porton , lamely .
" you 've been acting in a fine way , have n't you , porton ? "
went on <name> , angrily .
" huh !
what have i done ? "
porton 's gaze was shifty .
he did not dare to look our hero in the eyes .
" you know well enough what you 've done , porton  buying a whole lot of goods in my name . "
" what are you talking about ?
i did n't do any such thing ! "
was the blustering reply .
the former moving-picture actor was recovering from his surprise .
" i can prove that you did ; and i 'm going to hold you responsible for it , " answered <name> , calmly .
" look here , <name> , i do n't want any such talk from you ! "
and now <name> porton doubled up his fists and stuck out his <name> .
" i 've stood all i am going to stand from you .
i want you to leave me alone . "
" porton , you can bluster all you please , but it wo n't do you any good , " answered <name> , and his voice had a more positive ring to it than before .
" you thought you could play this trick on me and get away with it , but i am going to show you it ca n't be done .
i am going to hand you over to the authorities and see that you go to jail . "
" if you think you can do that , <name> , you 've got another guess coming .
you clear out and let me alone or i 'll make it hot for you ; " and <name> porton shook his fist in <name> 's face .
the manner of the young man who had been obtaining goods in dave's name was so aggressive that many a youth would have been <unk> and inclined to withdraw .
but that was not our hero 's way .
he was <unk> indignant , not only because of what the rascal before him had done , but also because of his present threat .
without more ado he seized hold of porton 's upraised arm and backed the fellow against a tree .
[ illustration : he seized porton 's upraised arm and backed the fellow against a <unk>  <name> <unk> ] " now , you just listen to me , " he said sternly .
" your bluff and bluster wo n't do you any good .
i am going to hand you over to the authorities , and that is all there is to it .
you 've got to behave yourself and stop threatening me , or i 'll give you something that you wo n't want . "
" you imp , you !
let go of me ! "
roared porton , and , bringing around his disengaged hand , he struck <name> a glancing blow on the <name> .
if anything more was needed to arouse our hero 's just ire , this blow proved more than sufficient .
as much anger as he had ever felt in his life surged up in <name> 's heart .
he <name> back , letting go his hold  and the next instant his fist shot out and landed straight on <name> porton 's nose .
" ouch ! "
spluttered the former moving-picture actor , and not without reason , for the stinging blow our hero had delivered not only hurt exceedingly , but also caused the blood to flow .
" now <name> you behave yourself and come with me , or do you want some more ? "
demanded <name> .
" i 'll fix you for that !
just wait ! "
bellowed porton ; and then he made a savage rush at our hero .
the next instant they were locked in each other 's arms and swaying from side to side , each doing his utmost to gain the mastery .
chapter viii the basswood fortune over and over in the snow of the woods rolled <name> and porton , first one being on top and then the other .
each was encumbered by his heavy overcoat and his gloves , so that to send in a decisive blow was practically impossible .
the former moving-picture actor fought desperately , for he had no <name> to go to jail , and he realized that <name> meant to send him to such a place if he could possibly accomplish it .
<name> , on his part , was angered through and through , not only because of what porton had done at the stores , but also because of the way the former moving-picture actor had threatened him .
the encounter had occurred at a spot where the trees were somewhat scattered and where rocks were numerous .
as the two continued their struggle they sent the loose snow flying in all directions and often struck on some of the rocks .
at last <name> managed to get his opponent by the throat , and he forced porton 's head backward against a large stone .
in the meantime , however , the rascal managed to double up one of his legs , and he gave <name> a shove in the stomach which sent him rolling over on his side .
" now i 'll fix you ! "
panted porton , and , releasing his right hand , he picked up a loose stone which their scuffle had exposed to view .
the next instant he brought the stone up , hitting our hero on the side of the head .
it was a furious blow , and for the moment <name> was stunned .
he let go of the other 's throat , and as he did this <name> porton arose to his feet .
" now i guess you 'll let me alone ! "
he snarled ; and aimed a vicious kick at <name> 's head .
but the youth , even though somewhat bewildered , had sense enough left to dodge , and the blow landed on his shoulder .
then porton turned and dashed wildly along the woods path leading in the direction of <unk> .
it took our hero several seconds to collect himself sufficiently to arise .
his ear was ringing from the contact with the stone , which fortunately had been a smooth one , and his shoulder also ached , even though the kick had been delivered through the <unk> of his overcoat .
he gazed along the path , and was just in time to see porton disappearing around a bend .
if <name> had been thoroughly angry before , he was now even more so ; and , shaking his head to clear his <name> , he started on a run after the fugitive .
he reached the turn in the path to see porton emerging from the woods and taking to the highway leading to the railroad depot .
" he must be running to catch a train , " thought our hero .
" and if that is so i 'll have to hustle or he 'll get away . "
by the time <name> gained the highway leading to <unk> , <name> porton had reached the vicinity of the first of the houses in the village .
here he paused to glance back , and , seeing his pursuer , shook his fist at <name> .
then he went on about fifty yards farther , suddenly turning into a <name> between two of the houses .
" he 's afraid to go to the depot for fear i 'll get after him before a train comes in , " thought <name> .
" well , i 'll catch him anyway , unless he takes to the woods . "
what <name> had surmised was correct .
<name> porton had thought to get on a train that would stop at <unk> inside of the next ten minutes .
now , however , he realized that to go to the depot and <name> around until the cars took their departure would probably mean capture .
" confound the luck !
how did he manage to get on my trail so quickly ? "
muttered the former moving-picture actor to himself .
" now i 'll have to lay low and do my best to sneak off to some other place .
i wish it was n't so cold .
when i stop running i 'll be half frozen .
but , anyway , i had the satisfaction of giving him one in the ear with that rock and another in the shoulder with my foot , " and he smiled grimly , as he placed his handkerchief to his bleeding nose .
by the time <name> reached the <name> between the houses , porton was nowhere in sight .
there were a number of footprints in the snow , and following these <name> passed a barn and some <unk> .
from this point a single pair of footprints led over a short field into the very woods where the encounter had taken place .
" he 's going to hide in the woods , sure enough , " reasoned our hero .
" or else maybe he 'll try to get back to <name> , or <unk> . "
" hi !
what 's going on here ? "
cried a voice from the cow-shed , and a man showed himself , followed by two <unk> boys .
" i 'm after a fellow who just ran across that field into the woods , " explained <name> , quickly .
" he 's a thief .
i want to catch him and have him locked up . "
" oh , say !
i thought i saw somebody , " exclaimed one of the boys .
" i thought it might be <name> jones goin ' huntin ' . "
in as few words as possible <name> explained the situation to the farmer and his two sons , and they readily agreed to accompany him into the woods .
" but you 'll have a big job trying to locate that chap in those woods , " was the farmer 's comment .
" the growth back here is very thick , and my boys have been lost in it more than once . "
" huh !
we always found our way out again , " grumbled the older of the sons , who did not like this statement on his parent 's part .
" yes , <name> , but the woods are mighty thick , " returned his brother .
" if that feller do n't look out he may get lost and get froze to death to-night , unless he knows enough to make a fire . "
it was easy enough to follow the footprints to the edge of the woods .
but once there , the brushwood and rocks were so thick that to follow the marks one would have had to have the eyes of an expert <unk> .
<name> and the farmer , with the two boys , searched around for the best part of a quarter of an hour , but without success .
" he 's slipped you , i guess , " remarked the farmer , shaking his head .
" i thought he would . "
" are there any trails running through the woods in this vicinity ? "
" the only trail i know of is the one running to <unk> .
there is a woods road used by the lumbermen , but that is on the other side of the railroad tracks . "
the struggle with <name> porton , followed by the run , had put <name> into quite a perspiration , and in the depth of the woods he found it exceedingly cold .
" i 'll have to keep on the move or i may get a chill , " he told the others , after another look around .
" i guess we had better give it up . "
" goin ' to offer any reward for <unk> ' that feller ? "
questioned the older of the two boys , when the four were on their way back to the cow-shed .
" yes , i 'll give a reward , " answered our hero , promptly .
" if any of you can catch him and have him held by the authorities i 'll give you ten dollars . "
" wow !
me for the ten dollars ! "
cried the youth .
" but say !
how 'll i know that feller if i do find him ? "
he questioned suddenly .
" that 's right , <name> , you wo n't want to hold the wrong man , " put in the father , with a grin .
" if you did that , you might get into hot water , " and he chuckled .
" it <name> be easy to recognize him , " answered <name> .
" just take a good look at me .
well , unfortunately , that other fellow resembles me very closely .
in fact , that 's the reason i want to catch him .
that 's how he got those goods i said he had stolen .
it 's virtually stealing to get goods in such an underhand manner . "
" all right , i 'll know the feller if he looks like you , " said <name> .
he turned to his younger brother .
" say , <name> , what do you say if we go into the woods later on and lay low for that feller ?
maybe he 'll come out this way after he thinks the way is clear . "
" sure , i 'll go with you , " declared <name> .
" if we look around very carefully we may be able to pick up his tracks somewhere . "
it must be admitted that <name> felt much crestfallen when he bade good-bye to the farmer and his sons , after having left them his name and address .
the farmer had offered to drive him back to <unk> , but our hero had stated that he would rather walk and take the short cut through the woods .
when he arrived at the village he found <name> wondering what had become of him .
" well , did you catch porton ? "
queried the senator 's son .
" i did and i did n't , " answered <name> , with a grim sort of smile .
and he related the particulars of what had occurred .
" great <unk> , <name> !
you certainly have had an experience ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" let me look at that ear .
i declare !
it 's quite swollen .
i <name> it did n't hurt anything inside , " he added anxiously .
" it rings and aches a little , <name> ; but i do n't think it is seriously hurt . "
" how about your shoulder ? "
" that feels a little sore , but that 's all .
i 'll soon get over it . "
" and to think you got so close to capturing him and then he got away ! "
was the sad comment of the senator 's son .
" it does beat all how slippery some of those rascals are . "
" i 'm living in <name> that those farmer boys <name> locate porton , " said <name> .
" i promised them a reward of ten dollars if they did so .
that's a lot of money for lads living around here . "
now that he had rejoined <name> , and had gotten partly over the effects of his encounter with porton , <name> was rather loath to give up the hunt .
they managed to find a store where the proprietor occasionally furnished <unk> , and there procured some sandwiches and hot chocolate .
then they drove to <unk> by the regular highway , and there took another look around for the missing <unk> .
" the boys have gone down to the woods to look for him , " announced the farmer when <name> called on him once more .
" if they learn anything i'll let you know . "
that evening found <name> and <name> back in crumville , where , of course , they had to relate the details of what had happened .
" oh , <name> , you must be more careful ! "
cried <name> , after he had told of the encounter in the woods .
" that wicked fellow might kill you ! "
and she shuddered .
" yes indeed , you ought to be careful , " said <name> .
" why , he seems to be almost as bad as merwell and jasniff were ! "
" so he is , <name> .
and if i ever get the chance i 'll put him where they are  in prison , " answered the brother grimly .
as was to be expected , <name> was quite worked up over what had occurred , and that night he did not sleep very well .
both his father and his sister insisted that he go to a physician and have his ear examined .
" no damage done , so far as i can see , " said the doctor .
" but you had better bathe it with <unk> and keep it warm for a day or two . "
the next day <name> settled down to his studies as well as he was able .
he hoped that word might come in that <name> porton had been captured , but in this he was disappointed .
" i think he 'll steer clear of this neighborhood , for a while at least , " was mr. <name> 's comment .
" that 's just my idea , " added <name> 's uncle dunston .
" he must know that a great many swindled storekeepers and other people are on the watch for him . "
<name> had not seen <name> basswood for several days .
on the following evening the son of the real estate dealer came hurrying over to the wadsworth mansion .
" we 've got news about that mr. enos 's estate ! "
cried <name> , as soon as he met <name> and <name> .
" it 's the queerest thing you ever heard of .
mother does n't know what to make of it , and i do n't know what to make of it , either . "
" well , i <name> it 's a valuable estate if it is coming to your father , " said the senator 's son .
" i do n't know whether it is valuable or not , and neither does father .
he says in his telegram it is certainly worth several thousand dollars , and he does n't know but that it may be worth a hundred thousand dollars or more . "
" a hundred thousand dollars ! "
cried <name> , who had come in to hear what <name> had to tell .
" oh , <name> , that certainly is a fortune ! "
" well , what does it consist of ? "
queried <name> .
" if it may be worth all the way from two or three thousand dollars to a hundred thousand or more , it must be mining stocks or something like that . "
" no , it is n't in stocks or bonds or anything like that . "
" then what in the world does the estate consist of ? "
questioned our hero .
" miniatures , " answered <name> basswood , simply .
chapter ix something about miniatures " miniatures ? "
came from all of <name> basswood 's listeners in a chorus .
" do you mean those little paintings that are sometimes so valuable ? "
continued <name> .
" that 's it , " answered <name> .
" i do n't know much about miniatures myself , but as soon as mother and i heard about this queer fortune of ours she asked the minister .
you know he is quite interested in <name> , and he told her that most of these little miniatures , which are about the size of a silver dollar or a small saucer , are usually painted on <name> .
of course , some of them are not so valuable , but others , especially those painted by celebrated artists , are worth thousands of dollars . "
" and how many of these miniatures are there , <name> ? "
asked <name> , with increased curiosity .
" father did n't know exactly , but said they would number at least fifty , and maybe seventy-five . "
" i suppose they are paintings of celebrated individuals  kings , queens , and like that ? "
was <name> 's comment .
" no , these miniatures , so father stated , are made up almost entirely of the great fighters of the world  army and navy men , <unk> , admirals , and officers like that . "
" well , where in the world did this mr. enos get money enough to buy such things ? "
asked <name> , who had followed <name> into the room .
" that 's the queer part of it , " answered the real-estate dealer 's son .
" it seems , after mr. enos and my father gave up business and separated , enos went south  first to texas and then into mexico .
there he joined some men who were opening up a gold mine .
these men struck it <name> , and almost before he knew it mr. enos was worth quite a lot of money .
he had never been very much of a business man  being wrapped up almost entirely in <name>  and so he did not know how to handle his money .
he had always had a liking for miniatures , so my father stated , and he went in to gather this collection .
he did n't want any kings or queens or noted society women , or anything like that , but he did want every miniature ever painted of an army or a navy fighter .
of course , my father does n't know all the particulars yet , but he has learned that mr. enos put himself out a great deal to get hold of certain miniatures , hunting for them all over europe and also in this country .
he even went down to south <name> to get miniatures of some of their heroes , and also picked up several in mexico , and one or two in texas . "
" his hobby must certainly have had a strong hold on him , " was dave's comment .
" but still , that sort of thing is n't unusual .
i heard once of a <unk> collector who went all over the world collecting stamps , and finally gave up his last dollar for a rare stamp when he actually had n't enough to eat .
of course , he was a <unk> on the subject of stamp collecting . "
" well , my father has an idea that mr. enos must have been a little queer over his miniature collecting , " returned <name> .
" but even so , the fact remains that he left his collection of miniatures behind him , and that they are now the property of my father . "
" and what is your father going to do with them ? "
questioned <name> .
" he does n't know yet .
you see , the settling of the estate is in a very mixed-up condition .
he is going to stay in chicago for a week or so , and then he 'll probably bring the miniatures east with him and have some <name> expert place a <unk> on them .
after that i suppose he'll offer the miniatures for sale to <name> galleries and <name> collectors . "
this was about all <name> could tell concerning the fortune left to his parent .
the young folks talked the matter over for quite a while , and were presently joined by the older people , including caspar potts .
" miniatures , eh ? "
said the genial old professor , beaming mildly on <name> .
" very curious !
very curious indeed !
but some of them are wonderful works of <name> , and bring very good prices .
i remember , when a young man , attending a sale of <name> works , and a miniature of one of the english nobility was knocked down for a very large sum , several thousand dollars if i remember rightly . "
" well , it 's very fine to get hold of a fortune , no matter in what shape it is , " observed mr. wadsworth .
" just the same , <name> , i think your father would prefer to have it in good stocks and bonds , " and he smiled faintly .
" no doubt of that , sir , " was the prompt answer .
" but , as you say , miniatures are much better than nothing .
in fact , i 'd rather take a fortune in soft soap than not get it at all , " and at this remark there was a general laugh .
" oh , my gracious , <name> !
what would you do with a hundred thousand dollars ' worth of soft soap ? "
queried <name> , slyly .
" oh , i 'd go around and smooth down all my friends and enemies with it , " the boy returned , and this caused another laugh .
several more days passed , and during that time <name> and <name> continued to devote themselves to their studies .
mr. ramsdell , the old civil engineer , was on hand to tutor the two youths , and he declared that they were making satisfactory progress , and that he thought they would pass the coming examinations without much trouble .
" i wish i felt as confident about it as mr. ramsdell does , " observed our hero to his chum one day .
" the same here , <name> , " returned <name> .
" every time i think of that examination i fairly shake in my shoes .
passing at oak hall was n't a patch to passing as a civil engineer . "
there had been another fall of snow , and now sleighing was even better than before .
<name> and <name> went out in company with their uncle , and on their return both showed some excitement .
" oh , <name>  <name>  what do you think ! "
cried <name> .
" i 've got a letter from <name> endicott , and she is coming on from <name> ranch to spend several weeks with me , and she is going to bring along one of her old school chums , <name> <unk> .
what do you think of that ?
wo n't it be fine ? "
" it certainly <name> be , <name> , " answered her brother .
" when do you expect them to arrive ? "
" they are coming on immediately ; so i suppose they 'll be here in a day or two if they are following this letter . "
<name> looked inquiringly at <name> .
" what a pity <name> <name> is n't here , " she half whispered .
both of them knew that during the visit of the young folks to the endicott ranch the shipowner 's son and <name> endicott had become exceedingly friendly .
" well , i 've invited <name> to come here , " answered <name> .
" i guess all i 've got to do is to mention <name> to him and he 'll be on the way without delay . "
" then , by all means , send him word , " returned the sister .
" then we can make up a fine little party , for we can pair <name> <unk> off with <name> . "
a letter from <name> to <name> <name> was dispatched that evening , and the next day came a telegram from the shipowner 's son stating that he would come on that night .
" i knew the mention of <name> would fetch <name> , " remarked <name> to <name> , when they were alone .
" <name> certainly has got an eye on that girl . "
" well , you ca n't blame him , <name> .
<name> endicott is a splendid girl and comes from a splendid family .
i 'll never forget how royally they treated us when we were at <name> ranch . "
" yes , we certainly did have one grand time , in spite of what link merwell did to annoy us . "
" oh , drop link merwell ! "
<name> paused for a moment and then went on : " is n't it queer , <name> , how just as soon as you get rid of one bad egg like merwell another bobs up like this <name> porton ? "
" it is queer , <name> . "
<name> heaved a deep sigh .
" i wish i could get on the track of that rascal . "
" have n't heard a thing , have you ? "
" no . "
" well , you can be thankful that he has n't been around buying more goods in your name . "
" oh , i think i scared him pretty well when i met him in the woods .
he 'll probably lay low for a while  at least until he thinks the field is clear again .
but i 'd give a good deal if i never saw or heard of him again , " and <name> heaved another sigh .
the next day the local paper came out with a big article on the front <name> speaking about the basswood fortune .
mr. basswood had returned to town , and had been interviewed by a reporter , and the sheet gave many of the particulars regarding the wonderful miniatures left by mr. enos .
according to the paper they numbered sixty-eight all told , and were worth from a hundred dollars to five thousand dollars apiece .
it was said that they had been placed in a safe deposit vault , being packed in several <unk> cases .
the paper went on to state that mr. basswood thought something of bringing them to crumville , where they might be judged by a committee of experts in order to ascertain their real value .
the real-estate dealer was spoken of as a man well-known in the community , and the article concluded by stating that all the good people of crumville and vicinity would undoubtedly congratulate him on his good fortune .
" they certainly piled it on a little thick , " was <name> 's comment , after he and <name> had read the article .
" just the same , i agree with the paper  the <unk> richly deserve the fortune that has come to them . "
<name> had not forgotten those days , now long gone by , when he had been a boy just out of the poorhouse living with caspar potts , and how <name> basswood had been his one young friend during those trying times .
as luck would have it , all the young visitors bound for the wadsworth mansion reached crumville on the same train .
of course , the others went down to the depot to meet them , and there was a grand <unk> lasting several minutes .
" my , <name> , how you have grown ! "
declared <name> , after the numerous kisses and <unk> had come to an end .
" is n't she growing tall , <name> ? "
" she certainly is , " returned the brother .
and what they said was true  <name> endicott was now tall and <unk> , and exceedingly pretty to look at ,  so much so in fact , that <name> <name> could hardly take his eyes from her .
" it was mighty good of your folks to invite me down , " said the shipowner 's son , when the whole crowd was making its way over to where the wadsworth automobile and sleigh were standing .
" i appreciate it , i assure you . "
" oh , my !
you do n't suppose we could leave you out , <name> , with <name> here , " returned <name> , as he gave his chum a <unk> in the ribs .
" good for you , <name> ! "
<name> blushed a little , and then winked one eye .
" how are matters going between you and <name> ? "
" very well . "
" glad to hear it .
and i suppose <name> has that same old eagle eye of his on your sister <name> ? "
" well , you do n't find him talking very much to anybody else when <name> is around , " was <name> 's dry comment .
" oh , we had a perfectly splendid journey ! "
cried <name> endicott .
" and was n't it the strangest thing that we should run into <name> at the junction where we had to change cars to get here ? "
" must be some sort of mutual attraction , " cried <name> , mischievously .
and then to hide any possible confusion she added quickly to <name> <unk> : " i <name> you enjoyed the trip also . "
" yes , i had a splendid time , " answered the newcomer , a girl not quite so tall as <name> but almost equally good-looking .
" you see , this is my first trip to the east .
oh , i know i am going to have a perfectly lovely time ! "
she added enthusiastically .
the young folks piled into the sleigh and automobile , and in a very short time arrived at the wadsworth mansion .
here mrs. wadsworth was ready to receive the visitors , and her gracious manner made them feel at home immediately .
<name> , as was his custom , insisted on <unk> with <name> and <name> , while <name> endicott and her chum were made comfortable in a room next to those occupied by <name> and <name> .
" i do n't know what i 'm going to do with you boys , " said mrs. wadsworth , laughingly .
" you always bunk in as thick as fleas . "
" we got used to that at oak hall , " returned <name> .
" besides that , the room is a large one with two single beds in it , and we can easily put in a cot ; " and so it was settled .
" my , but i 'm mighty glad to be with you two fellows again ! "
declared the shipowner 's son , when the youths were left to themselves .
" it seems like a touch of old times . "
" so it does , " returned <name> , smiling broadly .
" from now on i suppose we wo n't be able to get together as much as we used to , " said <name> ; " so while we are together let us make the most of it . "
" so say we all of us ! "
cried <name> and <name> , gaily .
chapter x the big <unk> of course , even with so many visitors to entertain , <name> and <name> could not neglect their studies ; so it was arranged that every day the pair should apply themselves diligently to their books and to what their tutor had to say from eight o'clock until twelve .
then lunch would be had and the young folks could start out to enjoy themselves in one way or another .
on one occasion the three boys went hunting with dunston <name> in the woods back of crumville .
they had a most delightful time , and brought back quite a <unk> of rabbits , as well as several squirrels , and also a plump partridge , the bird being brought down by <name> .
" and it was a fine shot , davy , " remarked his uncle dunston in speaking about the partridge .
" as fine a shot on the wing as i ever saw . "
crumville boasted of a good-sized pond ; and from this the snow had been cleared , giving the young folks an opportunity for skating , which every one of them enjoyed to the utmost .
they also attended a concert given in the church one evening , and even went to a moving-picture show which had recently been opened in the town .
the moving pictures interested the two girls from the far west more than anything else , for , so far , they had had little opportunity to take in such a form of entertainment .
during those days <name> was continually on the watch for some information concerning <name> porton , but no word of any kind came in , and he finally concluded that the rascal had left that vicinity .
" most likely he thought things were growing too hot for him , " was <name> 's comment , when the boys talked the matter over .
" he probably realized that if he continued to go to the stores and get goods the way he did he would be caught sooner or later . "
<name> basswood often went out with the others , pairing off , as had been expected by <name> , with <name> <unk> .
this left <name> endicott more or less in <name> 's care , for which the shipowner 's son was grateful .
" yes , my father has brought the enos miniatures here , " answered <name> , one day , in reply to a question from <name> .
" he had them in a safe deposit vault first , but he concluded that they would probably be just as safe at our place .
you know , he has a big safe of his own in which he keeps all his real estate documents . "
mr. basswood 's office was in a wing of his house , and all the boys had visited it and knew that it contained a massive steel affair about five feet square and probably four feet deep .
" they ought to be safe there , <name> , " returned <name> .
" i do n't see what a thief could do with miniatures , and i do n't believe your father's office is liable to catch fire . "
" and that safe must be fire-proof , " put in <name> .
" i think it is fire-proof , " returned the real estate dealer 's son .
" and i guess you are right about thieves  they would rather steal money or jewelry or silverware , or something like that , every time . "
used to a life in the open air , and to riding and driving , the sleighing in and around crumville proved to be a constant delight to <name> and <name> .
as a consequence , it was arranged by the boys that the whole crowd should go out in a large sleigh , to be procured from the local livery stable and to be drawn by four reliable horses .
" we 'll put a lot of straw in the bottom of the sleigh and make it a sort of <unk> , " declared <name> .
" and just to think !
it <name> be moonlight ! "
cried his sister .
" won't that be the finest ever ! "
" it certainly <name> be ! "
came from <name> , her eyes beaming .
but then she turned suddenly to <name> , her face <unk> a little .
" who is going to drive  you ? "
" no , we 're going to have a regular man from the livery stable , " he answered .
and then as his sister turned away , he added in a low tone : " i did n't want to spend my time on the horses  i wanted to spend it on you . "
" oh , <name> ! "
murmured the girl , and blushed .
then she gave him a look that meant a great deal .
the <unk> was to start off about two o'clock the next afternoon , and did not expect to return to crumville until well towards midnight .
they were to go to the town of <name> , about seventeen miles away .
a new restaurant had been opened in this town , in connection with the hotel , and mr. and mrs. wadsworth had stopped there for a meal and had pronounced it excellent , the food being of first-class quality and an orchestra being present to <unk> matters up .
<name> had thought at first that he could not accompany the others , his father having been taken sick ; but as mr. basswood 's illness was not of a serious nature , mrs. basswood , knowing how disappointed the youth would be , urged that he go along anyhow .
" your father is resting quite comfortably , " she told <name> ; " and the doctor says he <name> be around again inside of a week , so you may as well take in this <unk> while you have the chance . "
" but there are those miniatures , mother , " returned <name> .
" was n't father going to let mr. wadsworth see them ? "
" mr. wadsworth is going to have several <name> critics at his home in a day or two , and then your father is to let all of them examine the miniatures carefully to see if he can get an idea of what they are worth .
but you need not bother your head about that .
if mr. wadsworth sends word that the critics have arrived at his house i 'll take care of the matter . "
and so this was arranged , and <name> went off to prepare for the <unk> .
at the appointed hour , the big sleigh came dashing up to the door of the wadsworth mansion .
all of the young folks , including <name> , were on hand and ready for the trip , each bundled up well for protection against the cold .
the sun had been shining in the morning , but towards noon it had gone under a heavy bank of clouds .
" looks a little to me like more snow , " observed dunston <name> , who was present to see them depart .
" i should n't be surprised to see you coming back in the midst of another fall . "
" oh , uncle dunston , do n't say that ! "
cried <name> .
" we want the moon to shine this evening . "
" well , it <name> shine , <name> , " returned the uncle , with a wink of the eye .
" it always does shine , even when we do n't see it , " and then he dodged when she laughingly picked up a chunk of snow and threw it at him .
into the big sleigh piled the girls , and the boys quickly followed .
all the back seats had been removed , and they nestled down in the thick straw and covered themselves with numerous robes .
" look out that you do n't <unk> off when you go over a bump , " cried dunston <name> to <name> and <name> , who sat at the back of the turnout .
" oh , we 'll hold on , do n't worry ! "
cried <name> .
" i 'm used to hanging on , " came from the western girl , quickly .
" riding in this sleigh wo n't be half as bad as hanging on to the back of a <unk> <unk> . "
" i guess that 's right , too , " answered <name> 's uncle .
" just the same , you take care .
i do n't want you young folks to have any accidents on this trip . "
" i trust you all have a good time , " came <unk> from old caspar potts , as he gazed at them and rubbed his hands .
" my , my !
how i used to enjoy sleighing when i was a young man !
and how many years ago that seems ! "
he added with a little sigh .
" do n't stay any later than midnight , " warned mrs. wadsworth .
" we 'll be back by that time unless something unusual turns up , " returned <name> .
he turned to the others in the sleigh .
" everybody fixed and ready ? "
" all ready ! "
came back the answering cry .
" then we 're off . "
<name> turned to the driver , a middle-aged colored man .
" let her go , wash. " " yassir , " responded washington bones , with a grin .
" <unk> ! "
he called to his horses .
and with a crack of the whip and a grand flourish the turnout left the front of the wadsworth mansion and whirled out on to the broad highway leading to <name> .
the four horses were used to working together , and they trotted along in fine style , causing many a passer-by to stop and gaze at the team and the <name> load of young people in admiration .
the horses were well equipped with bells , and each of the youths had provided himself with a good-sized horn , so that noise was not lacking as they dashed along past the stores and houses of crumville .
then they came out on the <name> road , where the sleighing was almost perfect .
" i <name> we do n't have any such adventure as we had at <unk> 's hill , " remarked <name> to <name> while they were spinning on their way .
" i do n't think these livery stable horses <name> run away , " he returned .
" they are used every day , and that makes them less frisky than our horses , which sometimes are in the stable for a week .
besides that , wash bones is one of the most careful drivers around here .
if he does anything , he 'll let the team hold back on him rather than urge them to do their best . "
on and on flew the sleigh , the young folks chatting gaily and occasionally bursting out into a verse of song .
" let 's give 'em our old oak hall song ! "
cried <name> , presently .
" that 's it ! "
came eagerly from his two chums , and a moment later they started up the old school song , which was <name> to the tune of auld <name> syne , the girls joining in : " oak hall we never shall forget , no matter where we roam ; it is the very best of schools , to us it 's just like home !
then give three cheers , and let them ring throughout this world so wide , to let the people know that we elect to here abide ! "
" say , that takes me back to the old days at oak hall , " remarked <name> , when the singing had come to an end .
" my , but those were the great days ! "
" i do n't believe we 'll ever see any better , <name> , " answered <name> .
the sleighing party had still three miles to go when suddenly <name> uttered a cry .
" it 's snowing ! "
" so it is ! "
burst out <name> .
" what a shame ! "
" maybe it wo n't amount to much , " said <name> .
" it often snows just a little , you know . "
the first flakes to fall were large , and dropped down lazily from the sky .
but soon it grew darker , and in a short time the snow was coming down so thickly that it almost blotted out the landscape on all sides .
" some fall this ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" looks now as if it were going to be a regular storm . "
" o dear !
and i wanted it to be moonlight to-night ! "
wailed <name> .
<name> was peering around and looking anxiously at the heavy , leaden sky .
" if this is going to be a heavy storm , maybe it might be as well for us to turn back , " he announced .
" turn back ? "
came from several of the others .
" yes . "
" what for , <name> ? "
questioned <name> .
" i do n't think a little snow is going to hurt us .
maybe it <name> help to keep us warm , " he added with a grin .
" we do n't want to get snowed in , <name> . "
" oh , let 's go on ! "
interposed <name> .
" even if it does keep on snowing it wo n't get very heavy in the next couple of hours .
we can hurry up with our dinner at <name> and be home again before it gets very deep . "
" all right , i 'm willing if the rest are , " returned <name> , who did not wish to throw " cold water " on their sport .
" <name> it is !
go ahead , wash , we want to get there just as soon as possible . "
on they plunged , the snow coming down thicker and thicker every minute .
then , just as the outskirts of the town were gained , they heard a curious humming sound .
" oh , <name> !
what is that ? "
queried <name> .
" it 's the wind coming up , " he answered .
" listen ! "
all did so and noted that the humming sound was increasing .
then the wind came tearing through the woods and down the highway with great force , sending the snow in driving sheets into their faces .
" my gracious , this looks as if it were going to be a blizzard ! "
gasped <name> , who had started up to see what the sound meant .
" we had better get under some kind of cover just as soon as possible . "
" we 'll be up to dat hotel in <unk> minute , " bawled washington bones , to make himself heard above the sudden fury of the elements .
" say !
dis suah is some <unk> 'm ! "
he added .
again he cracked his whip , and once more the four horses ploughed along as well as they were able .
they had to face both the wind and the snow , and these combined made progress slow .
by the time the party came into sight of the hotel with the restaurant attached , the wind was blowing almost a <name> , and the snow seemed to be coming down in driving chunks .
" drive us around to the side porch , " ordered <name> .
" it <name> be a little more sheltered there . "
" yassir , " came from the colored driver ; and soon they had come to a halt at the spot mentioned .
from under the snow and robes crawled the boys and the girls and lost no time in running into the hotel .
then the colored man drove the turnout down to the stables .
[ illustration : from under the snow and the robes crawled the boys and the girls  <name> <unk> ] " my !
did you ever see such a storm ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" and how quickly it came up ! "
" if it is n't a blizzard , it is next door to it , " returned <name> .
and then he added quickly : " it looks to me as if we were going to be snowbound ! "
chapter xi held by the blizzard " snowbound ! "
the cry came from several of the party .
" yes , snowbound , if this heavy fall continues , " answered <name> .
" just see how the chunks of snow are coming down , and how the wind is driving them along . "
it was certainly an interesting sight , and all the young people watched it for some time before they took off their wraps and prepared to sit down to the meal , which had been ordered over the telephone before leaving crumville .
" my , just listen to the wind ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" you 'd think it was a regular <unk> . "
" if it keeps on it certainly <name> be a blizzard , " put in <name> .
" in one way we can be glad we are under shelter , even though we are a good many miles from home . "
" yes .
and snow or no snow , i move that we sit down to dinner , " continued <name> .
" we ca n't go back while it is snowing and blowing like this , so we might as well make the best of our stay here . "
after having ordered a meal for the colored man , which was served in another part of the hotel , <name> joined his friends in the restaurant .
a special table had been placed in a cozy corner , and that was decorated with a large bouquet of hothouse flowers , with a smaller bouquet at each plate .
" oh , how lovely ! "
burst out <name> , when she saw the flowers .
" you folks in the east certainly know how to spread yourselves , " was <name> <unk> 's comment .
" just look at those beautiful flowers and then at the fierce snowstorm outside . "
" oh , let us forget the storm ! "
cried <name> .
" it <name> be time enough to think about that when we have to start for home . "
" that 's the truth ! "
answered her brother , gaily .
" everybody fall to and do as much damage to the <unk> as possible ; " and this remark caused a general smile .
then the first course was served and soon all of the party were eating and chatting with the greatest of satisfaction .
in the meanwhile , the blizzard  for such it really was  continued to increase in violence .
the wind tore along through the woods and down the streets of the town , bringing with it first the heavy chunks of snow and then some hard particles not unlike salt in appearance .
the fine snow seemed to creep in everywhere , and , driven by the wind , formed drifts which kept increasing in size steadily .
after the first course of raw oysters , came some cream of celery soup with <unk> , and then some roast turkey with <unk> sauce and vegetables .
after that the young folks had various kinds of dessert with hot chocolate , and then nuts with raisins .
" what a grand dinner ! "
remarked <name> , when they were finishing .
" <name> , you certainly know how to order the good things . "
" oh , i had <name> and <name> to help me on that , " returned our hero .
" trust them to order up the good things to eat . "
" and trust <name> to help us get away with them , " sang out the senator's son , gaily .
" there is only one time when those fellows ca n't eat , " retorted <name> .
" that is when they are asleep . "
at a small table not far away from where the young people were seated , sat an elderly man and a <name> .
" there is doctor renwick and his wife , " said <name> , when the meal was finished .
" they must have been sleighing , too .
i am going to speak to them . "
for dr. renwick came from crumville , and had often attended the <name> family , as well as the wadsworths .
" we are staying here for a few days , " said mrs. renwick to dave's sister , after they had shaken hands .
" you see , the proprietor of this hotel and restaurant is my cousin . "
" oh , i did n't know that , " said <name> .
" they certainly have a very nice place here , and the dinner we had was just too lovely for anything . "
" are you folks calculating to drive back to crumville now ? "
questioned dr. renwick .
" that was our expectation , " replied <name> , who had followed his sister ; " but it looks pretty fierce outside , does n't it ? "
" i should say so , <name> .
just listen to that wind , and see how it is driving the snow !
i should n't like to face it for any great distance . "
the others came up , and all the strangers were introduced to the doctor and his wife , and then the entire party left the restaurant and entered the parlor of the hotel , from the windows of which they could watch the storm .
" it certainly is fierce ! "
remarked <name> , as they gazed at the furious onslaught of the elements .
the wind was blowing as hard as ever , rattling the windows and sending the snow against the panes as if it were so much hail .
it was impossible to see across the street , and , although <name> boasted of a limited electric light service , all the lights upon the street corners were out .
" this storm is going to break down a lot of the wires , " announced <name> .
" what do you think about our trying to get back to crumville ? "
questioned <name> .
" to tell the truth , <name> , i do n't see how we are going to make it .
you do n't want to face that wind , do you ?
and going back we 'd have to head into it nearly all the way . "
" i think i 'll go outside and have a talk with the driver , " answered our hero , and went out accompanied by <name> and <name> .
" i 'd like to get home on account of my father 's being sick , " announced the real estate dealer 's son .
" otherwise i would just as lief stay here until to-morrow . "
" that 's all right enough for us boys , " put in <name> , " but how about the girls ? "
" we can leave them in mrs. renwick 's care if we have to , " announced <name> .
" <name> and <name> know her very well , and i am sure she 'll be only too glad to play the <unk> .
she 's a very nice <name> , and the doctor is a very fine man . "
they found that washington bones had had his supper and had returned to the stable to feed his horses .
when they questioned the colored man about getting back to crumville he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head .
" might try it if you say so , " he said ; " but it ai n't gwine to be no easy job , boss , and we may git stuck somewheres so as you <unk> n't git to not even a house .
then we might all be froze to death . "
" what do you think it is , wash , a blizzard ? "
questioned <name> .
" dat 's jest what dis is , boss .
and my opinion is it 's gwine to be a heap sight <unk> before it gits <unk> , " added the driver .
" i guess you 're right there , " answered <name> .
" and that 's one reason i think we ought to try to get back to crumville .
but just the same , i'd hate to get stuck somewhere along the road , as he says .
we boys might be able to get out of it along with wash , but we could n't expect the girls to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such a wind . "
there was an old-fashioned covered walk from the hotel to the stables , so that the boys in going from one place to the other had not had to expose themselves to the elements .
now , to get an idea of how bad the storm was , <name> walked out as far as the street , followed by his chums .
" great cæsar 's ghost ! "
puffed the senator 's son , as they stood where they could get the full benefit of the storm .
" this is frightful , <name> !
why , it would be nothing short of suicide to try to go anywhere ! "
" i  i  guess we <unk> better <unk> in and telephone that we <unk> come ! "
panted <name> ; and then lost no time in returning to the stable , followed by the others .
they had been outside less than five minutes , yet the fury of the blizzard had nearly taken their breath away .
" we wo n't attempt it , wash ; so you can make arrangements to stay here to-night , " announced <name> .
he turned to his chums .
" come on back to the hotel , and we <name> do what <unk> is necessary . "
they returned to the parlor , and there the situation was explained to the girls and to dr. renwick and his wife .
" oh , you must n't think of trying to get back to-night ! "
cried the doctor 's wife , quickly .
" there are plenty of vacant rooms here , and i 'll see to it that my cousin gives you good accommodations . "
" and <name> you look after the young ladies , mrs .
renwick ? "
questioned <name> .
" i certainly <name> , <name> , " she answered graciously .
" do n't let that worry you in the least .
i 'll be glad to take charge of such a nice family , " and she smiled sweetly at all the girls .
" we are going to telephone to crumville and let the folks know how matters stand , " announced <name> ; and then he and <name> hurried to where there was a telephone booth .
here , however , they met with no success so far as getting into communication with their folks at crumville was concerned .
it took a long time to get central , and then it was announced that the storm had taken down all the wires running to crumville and beyond .
one wire that was down was still connected , but , try their best , neither of the boys was able to understand anything of what was said over it .
then this line snapped ; and that ended all efforts to send any messages .
" i wish they knew we were safe , " said <name> .
" now that they do n't know it they may worry , thinking we are snowed in somewhere along the road . "
" well , we 've got to make the best of it , " answered <name> .
" i did <name> to speak to mother , to ask her how father was , and to let her know that we were all right . "
" it looks to me , <name> , as if this blizzard might last for several days or a week . "
" so it does .
but sometimes these storms clear away almost as rapidly as they come . "
the two youths returned to the others and announced the failure of their effort to get into communication with crumville .
this was disheartening to <name> and <name> , but as it could not be helped the girls said they would make the best of it .
then <name> and <name> went off with the doctor and his wife , to obtain accommodations for the whole party .
it was learned that dr. renwick had a fine apartment on the second floor , and that there were two rooms adjoining which were vacant .
these were turned over to the four girls .
the boys were accommodated with two rooms on the floor above .
" not quite as good as they might be , " observed <name> , when he and his chums inspected their rooms , which were directly under the roof of the country hotel .
" but they are much better than nothing , and , as the sailors say , 'any port in a storm . ' "
" oh , this is plenty good enough , " returned <name> .
" but i am glad the girls are on the floor below .
those rooms are much better than these . "
as the boys had no baggage , there was nothing for them to arrange in the rooms which had been assigned to them , so after a hasty look around they started to go downstairs again , to rejoin the girls in the parlor .
as the boys passed the room next to the one which <name> and <name> had elected to occupy , the door of the apartment was opened on a crack .
then , as the youths left the corridor to descend the stairs , the door was opened a little wider , and a young man peered out cautiously .
" well , what do you know about that ! "
muttered the young man to himself , after the four chums had disappeared .
" right here at this hotel , and going to occupy the room next to the one i 've got !
could you beat it ? "
the young man was <name> porton .
chapter xii <name> crapsey 's plot " who are you talking to , port ? "
questioned a man who was resting on the bed in the room which <name> porton occupied .
" did n't i tell you not to call me by that name , crapsey ? "
returned the former moving-picture actor , as he closed the door softly and locked it .
" what 's the difference when we 're alone ? "
grumbled the man called crapsey , as he shifted himself and rubbed his eyes .
" it may make a whole lot of difference , " answered porton .
" i 've just made a big discovery . "
" a discovery ? "
the man sat up on the edge of the bed .
" discovered how to git hold of some money , i <name> .
we need it . "
" you remember my telling you about that fellow who looks like me  the fellow named <name> <name> ? "
went on the former moving-picture actor .
" well , he 's here in this hotel .
and he and three of his chums have the rooms next to this one . "
" you do n't mean it ? "
and now <name> crapsey showed his interest .
" did they see you ? "
" not much !
and i do n't intend that they shall , " was the decided reply .
" did you know the other fellows ? "
" yes , they are the regular bunch <name> travels with .
i 've got to keep out of sight of all of them .
from what they said they are evidently snowbound here on account of this blizzard , so there is no telling how long they <name> stay , " added the former moving-picture actor in disgust .
" confound the luck !
i suppose i 'll have to stay in this room a prisoner and let you get my meals for me . "
" this fellow 's being here may not be such a bad thing for you , " remarked <name> crapsey .
" maybe you can <unk> him and touch the hotel clerk for a <name> of ten or twenty dollars . "
" i am not going to run too many risks  not with so many of those fellows on hand .
if i had only <name> to deal with it might be different , " returned <name> porton .
" just the same , i 'm going to keep my eyes open , and if i can get the best of him in any way you can bet your boots i 'll do it . "
in the meanwhile <name> and his chums had rejoined the girls and dr. renwick and his wife in the parlor of the hotel , and there all made themselves as much at home as possible .
there was quite a gathering of snowbound people , and a good deal of the talk was on the question of how long the blizzard might last .
" some of the people here are going to try to get over to <unk> , " said one man .
" that is only a mile and a quarter from here , and they are hoping to get the train that goes through that place about one o'clock in the morning . "
" the train may be snowbound , too , " returned another ; " and if it is those folks <name> have their hard tramp to <unk> for nothing . "
outside it was still snowing and blowing as furiously as ever .
all the street lights were out , and so were the electric lights in the hotel , so that the hostelry had to depend on its old-time lamps for its illumination .
but the lamps had been discarded only the year before so it was an easy matter to bring them into use again .
not to keep the good doctor and his wife up too long , <name> told mrs. renwick that they would retire whenever she felt like it .
about half past ten <unk> were said and the girls went upstairs with the <name> , followed presently by the doctor .
the boys remained below to take another peep out at the storm .
" it 's a regular old-fashioned blizzard , " announced <name> .
" and no telling how long we 'll be <unk> here , " added <name> .
" quite an adventure , is n't it ? "
and he smiled faintly .
" well , we can be thankful that we were n't caught somewhere along the road , " broke in <name> .
" that 's it ! "
came from <name> .
" why , if we had been caught in some out-of-the-way place , we might be frozen to death trying to find some shelter . "
the two rooms which the chums occupied on the third floor of the hotel were connected , and before they went to bed the youths all drifted into the one which was to be occupied by <name> and <name> , for here it was slightly warmer than in the other room , and the lamp gave a better light .
it seemed good to be together like this , especially on a night when the elements were raging so furiously outside .
the former school chums talked of many things  of days at oak hall , of bitter rivalries on the <name> , the gridiron , and on the boating course , and of the various friends and enemies they had made .
" the only one of our enemies who seems to have made a man of himself is <name> plum , " remarked <name> .
" he has settled down to business and i understand he is doing very well . "
" well , nat poole is doing fairly well , " returned <name> .
" i understand his father owns stock in that bank , so they 'll probably <unk> nat along as rapidly as his <unk> <name> permit . "
" nat was never the enemy that plum and jasniff and merwell were ! "
cried <name> .
" he was one of the weak-minded kind who thought it was smart to follow the others in their doings . "
" this storm is going to interfere with our studies , <name> , " announced <name> .
" not but what i 'm willing enough to take a few days ' rest , " he added with a grin .
" we 'll have to make up for it somehow , <name> , " returned our hero .
" we 've got to pass that examination with flying colors . "
" i 'm afraid this storm <name> interfere with the <name> critics who were to look at those miniatures , " put in <name> .
" oh , dear !
i wish we knew just what those little paintings were worth . "
" i <name> they prove to be worth at least a hundred thousand dollars , " said <name> .
" that <name> be a nice sum of money for you folks , <name> . "
" right you are ! "
answered the son of the real estate dealer .
the youths were tremendously interested in the miniatures , and a discussion of them ensued which lasted the best part of half an hour .
<name> described some of the pictures as well as he was able , and told of how they were packed , and of how they had been placed in the basswood safe , waiting for the critics that mr. wadsworth had promised to bring from the city to his home to inspect them .
" well , i suppose we might as well turn in , " said <name> , presently , as he gave a yawn .
" i must confess i 'm tired . "
" come ahead , i 'm willing , " announced <name> ; and then he and the senator 's son retired to the next room .
" o pshaw !
what do you suppose i did ? "
exclaimed <name> to <name> , while the pair were undressing .
" i left my overcoat and my cap on the rack in the lower hallway .
i should have brought them up here . "
" i did the same thing , " answered his chum .
" i guess they 'll be safe enough .
all the folks in this hotel seem to be pretty nice people . "
" i do n't suppose there are any blizzard pictures among those miniatures , <name> ? "
observed <name> , with a laugh just before turning in .
" there is a picture of one army officer in a big , shaggy uniform which looks as if it might be worn because of cold weather , " answered <name> ; and then , as the miniatures were very close to his heart , the youth began to talk about them again .
this discussion lasted for another quarter of an hour , after which the chums retired and were soon deep in the land of slumber .
although none of our friends knew it , every word of their conversation had been listened to eagerly by <name> porton and the man with him .
they had noted carefully all that had been said about the basswood fortune , and about the miniatures having been placed in the real estate dealer 's safe awaiting inspection by the critics who were to visit mr. wadsworth at his mansion .
both had noted also what <name> had said about leaving his overcoat and his cap on the rack on the lower floor of the hotel .
" a hundred thousand dollars ' worth of miniatures ! "
murmured <name> crapsey , after the sounds in the adjoining room had ceased .
" say , that 's some fortune , sure enough ! "
" but pictures !
humph , what good are they ? "
returned <name> porton , in disgust .
" i 'd rather have my fortune in something a little more <unk> . "
" oh , pictures are not so bad , and miniatures can be handled very easily , " answered <name> crapsey .
his small eyes began to twinkle .
" jest you let me git my hands on 'em , and i 'll show you wot i kin do .
i know a fence in new york who 'll take pictures jest as quick as anything else . "
" and what would he do with them after he got them ? "
questioned <name> porton curiously .
" oh , he 'd ship 'em 'round to different places after he got 'em doctored up , and git rid of 'em somehow to <name> dealers and collectors .
of course , he might not be able to git full value for 'em ; but if they 're worth a hundred thousand dollars he might git ten or twenty thousand , and that ai n't bad , is it ? "
and <name> crapsey looked at <name> porton suggestively .
" easy enough to talk , but how are you going to get your hands on those miniatures ? "
demanded the former moving-picture actor , speaking , however , in a low tone , so that none of those in the next room might hear him .
" i jest got an idee , " croaked <name> crapsey .
he was a man who consumed a large amount of liquor , and his voice showed it .
" did n't you hear wot that chap said about leaving his coat and hat downstairs ?
if you could fool them shopkeepers the way you did , then , if you had that <unk> hat and coat , and maybe fixed up a bit to look like that photograph you had of him , you might be able to go to the basswood house and fool the folks there . "
" i do n't quite understand ? "
" i mean this way : we could go to crumville and you could watch your chance , and when the coast was clear you could git a rig and drive over to the basswood house and go in quite excited like and tell 'em that this mr. wadsworth was <unk> ' to see them miniatures right away ,  that a very celebrated <name> critic had called on him , but could n't stay long .
wanted to ketch a train and all that .
you could tell 'em that mr. wadsworth had sent you to git the miniatures , and that he had said that he would return 'em jest as soon as the critic had looked 'em over .
do you ketch the idee ? "
and <name> crapsey looked narrowly at his companion .
" it might work , although i 'd be running a big risk , " said <name> porton , slowly .
yet his eyes gleamed in satisfaction over the thought .
" but you forgot one thing , <name> : we are snowbound here , and we ca n't get away any quicker than they can . "
" that 's where you 're mistaken , port  i mean mr. jones , " crapsey checked himself hastily .
" i heard some folks downstairs talkin ' about going over to <unk> to ketch the one o'clock train .
that goes through crumville , and if we could ketch it we 'd be in that town long before mornin ' .
we could fix up some story about the others bein ' left behind here , and <name> <name> comin ' home alone .
they ca n't send any telephone message , for the wires are down , and i do n't know of any telegraph office here where they could send a message that way . "
" if we were going to try it we 'd have to hustle , " announced <name> porton .
" and it 's a fierce risk , let me tell you that ,  first , trying to get to the railroad station , and then trying to bluff mr. and mrs. basswood into thinking i am <name> <name> .
you must remember that since i got those things in <name> 's name at those stores , the whole crowd are on their guard . "
" well , you ca n't gain anything in this world without takin ' chances , " retorted <name> crapsey .
" if i looked like that feller i 'd take the chance in a minute .
why , jest see what we could make out of it !
if you can git your hands on those miniatures , i 'll take care of the rest of it and we can split <unk> on what we git out of the deal . "
<name> porton mused for a moment while <name> crapsey eyed him closely .
then the former moving-picture actor leaped softly to his feet .
" i 'll do it , <name> ! "
he cried in a low voice .
" come ahead  let us get out of this hotel just as soon as possible .
and on the way downstairs i 'll see if i ca n't lift that cap and overcoat . "
chapter xiii what washington bones had to tell <name> was the first of the four chums to awaken in the morning .
he glanced toward the window , to find it covered with frost and snow , thus leaving the room almost dark .
the wind was still blowing furiously , and the room was quite cold .
without disturbing <name> our hero looked at his watch and found that it was almost eight o'clock .
he leaped up and commenced to dress .
" hello !
getting up already ? "
came sleepily from his <unk> , as <name> stretched himself and rubbed his eyes .
" it must be pretty early . "
" that 's where you 're mistaken , <name> , " was <name> 's answer .
" in a few minutes more it <name> be eight o'clock . "
" you do n't say so !
how dark it is !
but i suppose it 's the frost on the window makes that , " went on the real estate dealer 's son , as he , too , got up .
" phew !
but it 's some cold , is n't it ? "
and he started to dress without delay .
the noise the two boys made in moving around the room aroused the others , and soon they too were getting up .
" wow !
talk about greenland 's icy mountains ! "
commented <name> , with a shiver .
" how 'd you like to go outside , <name> , just as you are , and have a snowball fight ? "
" nothing doing ! "
retorted the senator 's son , who was getting into his clothing just as rapidly as possible .
" say , fellows , but this surely is some snowstorm ! "
he continued , as he walked to the window and scraped some frost from a pane of glass so that he could catch a glimpse of what was outside .
" it 's still snowing to beat the band ! "
he announced .
" and listen to the wind ! "
broke in <name> .
" why , sometimes it fairly rocks the building ! "
" does n't look much as if we were going to get back to-day , " said <name> .
" i suppose the roads are practically impassable . "
" they must be if it snowed all night , " answered <name> .
" let us go down and take a look around . "
" i wonder if the girls are up yet ? "
questioned <name> .
" it wo n't make much difference whether they are or not , " returned <name> .
" if we ca n't get away from here they may as well sleep as long as they please .
there certainly is n't much to do in this small hotel . "
the youths were soon washed and dressed , and then all trooped below .
they passed the rooms occupied by the girls and by dr. renwick and his wife , but heard no sounds coming from within .
" they are taking advantage of the storm to have a good rest , " commented <name> .
he gave a yawn .
" i almost wish i had remained in bed myself .
we wo n't have a thing to do here . "
" i noticed a bowling alley next door , <name> , " announced <name> .
" if we ca n't do anything else to-day we can bowl a few games .
that <name> be fine exercise . "
" do the girls know about bowling ? "
questioned <name> .
" not very much , " answered <name> .
" <name> has bowled a few games , i believe .
but it <name> be fun to teach them , if we do n't find anything better to do . "
the boys walked through the small lobby of the hotel and into the smoking room .
here several men were congregated , all talking about the storm and the prospects of getting away .
" the snow is nearly two feet deep on the level , " said one man ; " but the wind has carried it in all directions so that while the road is almost bare in some spots there are drifts six and eight feet high in others . "
" looks as if we were snowed in good and proper , " returned another man .
" i wanted to get to one of those stores across the way , and i had about all i could do to make it .
in one place i got into snow up to my waist , and it was all i could do to get out of it . "
" does n't look like much of a chance to get away from here , " observed <name> .
" we are booked to stay right where we are , " declared <name> ; " so we might as well make the best of it . "
" let us go out to the barn and see what wash bones has to say , " suggested <name> .
" he has probably been watching the storm and knows just how things are on the road . "
" all right , " returned <name> .
" but i am going to put on my cap and overcoat before i go .
it must be pretty cold out there even though they do keep the doors shut . "
" yes , i 'll get my cap and overcoat , too , " said <name> .
<name> and <name> had taken their things up to the third floor the night before , and now had their overcoats over their arms .
the large rack in the hallway of the hotel was well filled with garments of various kinds , so that <name> had to make quite a search before he found his own things .
in the meantime , <name> was also hunting , but without success .
" that 's mighty queer , " remarked the latter .
" i do n't seem to see my cap or my overcoat anywhere . "
" oh , it must be there , <name> , " cried his chum .
" just take another look .
maybe the overcoat has gotten folded under another . "
both youths made a thorough search , which lasted so long that <name> and <name> came into the hallway to ascertain what was keeping them .
" <name> ca n't find his overcoat or his cap , " explained <name> .
" we've hunted everywhere for them . "
" did n't you take them up-stairs last night ? "
questioned <name> .
" no , i left them on this rack .
and <name> left his things here , too , " replied <name> .
" i ca n't understand it at all ; " and he looked worried .
" maybe <name> saw them and took them upstairs , thinking they wouldn't be safe here , " suggested <name> .
" i hardly think that , <name> .
however , as the coat and cap are not here , maybe i 'd better ask her . "
another search for the missing things followed , <name> looking through the parlor and the other rooms on the ground floor of the hotel , and even peeping into the restaurant , where a number of folks were at breakfast .
then he went upstairs and knocked softly on the door of the room which <name> and <name> were occupying .
" who is it ? "
asked his sister , in a somewhat sleepy tone of voice .
" it 's i , <name> , " answered her brother .
" i want to know if you brought my cap and overcoat upstairs last night . "
" why , no , <name> , i did n't touch them .
what is the matter  ca n't you find them ? "
" no , and i 've hunted high and low , " he returned .
" i do n't suppose any of the other girls or the doctor touched them ? "
" i am quite sure they did not . "
<name> came to the door and peeped out at him .
" are you boys all up already ? "
" yes , we went down-stairs a little while ago .
we were going out to the barn , and that 's why i wanted my overcoat and cap .
they seem to be gone , and i do n't know what to make of it ; " and now <name> 's face showed increased anxiety .
" what 's the trouble ? "
came from <name> , and then <name> closed the door again .
<name> heard some conversation between all of the girls , and then between <name> and mrs. renwick .
then his sister came to the door once more .
" none of us touched your cap or overcoat , <name> , " she said .
" is n't it queer ?
do you suppose they have been stolen ? "
" i <name> not , <name> .
i 'm going down and see the hotel proprietor about it . "
the proprietor of the hostelry was not on hand , but his son , a young fellow of about <name> 's age , was behind the desk , and he listened with interest to what our hero had to say .
then he , too , instituted a search for the missing things .
" i ca n't understand this any more than you can , " he announced , after this additional search had proved a failure .
" i did n't know we had any thieves around here .
are you sure you left the coat and cap on this rack ? "
" yes , i am positive , " announced <name> .
" i saw him do it , when i placed my own things on the same rack , " declared <name> .
" but you found your coat and cap all right ? "
" yes . "
" it 's mighty queer , " declared the young clerk , shaking his head .
" i guess i 'd better tell my father about this . "
the hotel proprietor was called , and he at once instituted a number of inquiries concerning the missing things .
but all these proved of no avail .
no one had taken <name> 's wearing apparel , and none of the hired help had seen any one else take the things or wear them .
" you should have taken your things up to your room last night , " declared the hotel proprietor , during the course of the search .
" it's a bad idea to leave things on a rack like this , with so many strangers coming and going all the time . "
he agreed to lend <name> a coat and a hat , and , donning these , the youth walked through the little shelter leading to the stables , accompanied by his chums .
" if those things are not recovered i think you can hold the hotel man responsible , " remarked <name> .
" just what i think , " put in <name> .
" that overcoat was a pretty nice one , <name> ; and the cap was a peach . "
" i 'll see what can be done , in case the things do n't turn up , " returned our hero .
they found washington bones down among the <unk> , taking care of his horses .
" well , wash , what are the prospects for getting away this morning ? "
questioned <name> .
" ai n't no prospects , so far as i kin see , " declared the colored driver .
" this suah am one terrible <unk> 'm .
i <unk> seen the like <unk> aroun ' heah . "
" then you do n't think we 're going to get back to crumville to-day ? "
questioned <name> .
" <unk> .
why , if we was to try it we 'd suah git stuck befo ' we got out ob dis town .
some ob de drifts is right to de top of de fust story ob de houses . "
washington bones looked questioningly at <name> .
" how did you like your trip outside las ' night ? "
he queried .
" must <name> ' been some walkin ' , <unk> sech deep snow . "
" my trip outside ? "
questioned <name> , with a puzzled look .
" what do you mean , wash ?
i did n't go out last night . "
" you did n't ! "
exclaimed the colored driver in wonder .
" did n't i see you leavin ' de hotel las ' night 'bout half pas ' <unk> or a little later ? "
" you certainly did not .
i was in bed and sound asleep by half past eleven , " answered <name> .
" well now , do n't dat beat all ! "
cried the colored man , his eyes rolling in wonder .
" i went outside jest to take a las ' look <unk> befo ' turning in , and i seen a young fellow and a man leavin ' de hotel .
dey come right pas ' where a lantern was <name> up on the porch , and when dat light struck on de young fellow 's face i thought suah as you 're <unk> it was you .
why , he looked like you , and he had on de same kind of cap and overcoat dat you was <unk> ' <unk> .
i see you've got on something different to-day . "
" a fellow who looked like me and who had on my cap and my overcoat ! "
ejaculated <name> .
he turned to his chums .
" what do you make of that ? "
" maybe it was <name> porton ! "
cried <name> .
" if it was , he must have run away and taken <name> 's cap and overcoat with him , " added <name> .
chapter xiv movements of the enemy as my readers doubtless surmise , it was <name> porton who had made off with <name> 's overcoat and cap .
leaving the room which they occupied on the third floor locked , the young moving-picture actor and his disreputable companion had stolen down the two flights of stairs leading to the lower hallway .
fortunately for them , no one had been present , and it had been comparatively easy for porton to find <name> 's things and put them on .
<name> crapsey already wore his own overcoat and hat .
" we might as well provide ourselves with <unk> while we are at it , " remarked crapsey , as his gaze fell upon a number of such <unk> resting near the rack , and thereupon each donned a pair of <unk> that fitted him .
thus equipped they had stolen out of the hotel through a side hallway without any one in the building being aware of their departure .
" we 're going to have a fight of it to get to the railroad station , " muttered <name> porton , as the fury of the storm struck both of them .
" it 's lucky i know the way , " croaked <name> crapsey .
and then , as they passed over the porch in the light of the lantern by which washington bones had seen porton , the man went on : " say , what 's the matter with us <unk> ' at some drinkin ' place and gittin ' a little liquor ? "
" not now , " interposed his companion , hastily .
" we want to make our <unk> without being seen if we possibly can . "
" oh , nobody <name> know us , " grumbled crapsey , who had a great fondness for liquor , " and the stuff may prove a <unk> if we git stuck some place in the snow . "
the realization that they might become snowbound on the way to <unk> made porton pause , and in the end he agreed to visit a drinking place several blocks away , which , by the light shining dimly through the window , they could see was still open .
" but now look here , <name> , you 're not going to <unk> it , " said the former moving-picture actor , warningly .
" if we are going to pull this stunt off you are going to keep perfectly sober .
it 's one drink and no more ! "
" but i 'm goin ' to git a flask to take along , " pleaded the man .
" you can do that .
but i give you fair warning that you 've got to go slow in using the stuff .
otherwise we are going to part company .
in such a game as we are trying to put over , a man has got to have his wits about him . "
having procured a drink , and also a package of cigarettes and a flask of liquor , the two set off through the storm for the railroad station , a mile and a quarter away .
it was a hard and tiresome journey , and more than once they had to stop to rest and figure out where they were .
twice <name> crapsey insisted upon it that he must have a " <unk> " from the flask .
" i 'm froze through and through , " he declared .
" well , i 'm half frozen myself , " retorted <name> porton , and when he saw the man drinking he could not resist the temptation to take some of the liquor himself .
" we 'll be in a fine pickle if we get to <unk> and then find that the train is n't coming through , " remarked the former moving-picture actor , when about three-quarters of the journey had been covered and they were resting in the shelter of a roadside barn .
" that 's a chance we 've got to take , " returned his companion .
" but i do n't think the train <name> be <unk> .
most of the tracks through here are on an embankment , and the wind would keep them pretty clear . "
it was after one o'clock when the pair finally gained the little railroad station at <unk> .
they found over a dozen men and several women present , all resting in the <name> waiting-room , trusting that the train would soon put in an appearance .
" the wires are down so they ca n't tell exactly where the train is , " said one of the men , in reply to a question from porton .
" they are hoping , though , that it is n't many miles away . "
from time to time one of the would-be passengers would go out on the tracks to look and listen , and at last one of these announced that a train was on the way .
" but i ca n't tell whether it 's a passenger train or a freight , " he said .
" let 's git on it even if it 's a freight , " said <name> crapsey to <name> porton .
" she 'll take us to crumville jest as well . "
" all right , provided we can get aboard . "
slowly the train puffed in and proved to be a freight .
on the rear , however , was a passenger car , hooked on at the last station .
[ illustration : slowly the train puffed in , and proved to be a freight .
<name> <unk> ] " the regular passenger train is <unk> in the cut beyond <unk> , " announced the conductor of the freight , " and there 's no telling when she 'll get out .
if you folks want to risk getting through , get aboard ; " and at this invitation all those waiting at the station lost no time in boarding the mixed train .
then , with a great deal of puffing and blowing , the locomotive moved slowly away from <unk> , dragging the long line of cars , some full and some empty , behind it .
long before crumville was reached it became a question as to whether the train would get through or not .
the snow was coming down as thickly as ever , and the wind whistled with increased violence .
" i do n't believe we 'll get much farther than crumville , " announced the conductor , when he came through to collect tickets .
" we should have passed at least two trains coming the other way .
but nothing has come along , and that would seem to show that the line is blocked ahead of us . "
as a matter of fact , the mixed train did not get even as far as dave's home town .
running was all right so long as the tracks were up on the embankment , but as soon as they reached the level of the surrounding country the snow became so deep that several times the train had to be backed up so that a fresh start might be made .
then , when they came to a cut not over three feet deep , just on the outskirts of the town , the engineer found it utterly impossible to get any farther .
" we 'll have to have a <unk> to get us out , " he declared , " or otherwise we 'll have to remain here until the storm clears away . "
by listening to the conversation of some of the people in the car , porton and crapsey learned that it was only a short distance to the town , and they followed several men and a woman when they left the train to finish the journey on foot .
" i know where we are now , " said porton , presently , as he and his companion struck a well-defined road leading past the wadsworth jewelry works .
" we 'll be right in crumville in a little while more . "
<name> porton knew very well that he must not show himself in crumville any more than was necessary .
consequently , as soon as they came within sight of the town proper , he suggested that they look around for some place where they might remain until daybreak .
" right you are , " answered <name> crapsey .
and a little later , coming to a large barn , they tried the door , and , finding it unlocked , entered and proceeded to make themselves comfortable in some hay , using several horse blankets for coverings .
here both of them , being thoroughly exhausted , fell sound asleep and did not awaken until it was daylight .
" now we 've got to lay our plans with great care , " announced <name> porton .
" we ca n't go at this in any haphazard way .
even though it may prove comparatively easy to get our hands on those miniatures , it <name> be another story to get away with them in such a storm as this , with the railroad and every other means of communication tied up . "
" this storm is jest the thing that 's goin ' to help us , " answered crapsey .
" with all the telegraph and telephone wires down the authorities wo n't be able to send out any alarm .
and with the snow so deep , if we git any kind of a start at all it <name> be next to impossible for 'em to follow us up . "
a discussion of ways and means followed that lasted the best part of an hour .
then , with money provided by porton , and with many an admonition that he must not for the present drink another drop , <name> crapsey was allowed to depart for crumville .
" and you be very careful of how you go at things , " warned porton .
<name> crapsey had a delicate mission to perform .
first of all he was to size up matters around the homes of the wadsworths and the <unk> , and then he was to do what he could to hire a cutter and a fast horse at the local livery stable .
this done , he was to procure something to eat both for himself and for his companion .
as time went by <name> porton , on the alert for the possible appearance of the owner of the barn , became more and more anxious , and twice he went out in the roadway to see if his companion was anywhere in sight .
" it would be just like him to go off and get full of liquor , " muttered the young man , with a scowl .
" i really ought to part company with him .
but when he is perfectly sober he certainly is a slick one , " he continued meditatively .
to pass the time the young man made a thorough search of the overcoat which he had stolen from <name> .
he had already discovered a fine pair of gloves and had worn them .
now , in an inner pocket , he located a <unk> containing half a dozen addresses , some postage stamps , and some of <name> 's visiting cards .
there were also two cards which had been blank , and on each of these , written in <name> 's bold hand , was the following : signature of <name> <name> , <unk> " hello !
what 's this ? "
mused the former moving-picture actor , as he gazed at the written cards .
then suddenly his face brightened .
" oh , i see !
it 's one of those cards that i heard about  the kind he has been distributing among the storekeepers in an effort to catch me .
say , one of these may come in handy when i go for those miniatures ! "
he continued .
at last he heard a noise outside , and looking in that direction saw <name> crapsey approaching in a somewhat dilapidated cutter , drawn , however , by a <unk> bay horse .
" had a fierce time gittin ' this horse , " announced the man , as he came to a halt beside the barn .
" the livery stable man did n't want to let him go out , and i had to tell him a long yarn about somebody bein' sick and my havin ' to git a doctor .
and i had to offer him double price , too ! "
and at his own ruse the man chuckled hoarsely .
he had brought with him some sandwiches and doughnuts , and also a bottle of hot coffee , and on these both made a somewhat limited breakfast , the man washing the meal down with another drink from his flask .
" i kept my word  i did n't drink a drop when i was in town , " he croaked .
" but say , this is mighty dry work ! "
" you keep a clear head on your shoulders , <name> , " warned porton .
" some day , drink is going to land you in jail or in the grave . "
" not much ! "
snorted the man .
" i know when to stop . "
but porton knew that this was not true .
another conference was held , and crapsey told of having taken a look around , both at the wadsworth place and the basswood home .
" there is no one at the basswood place but mr. and mrs. basswood ; and i understand the man is sick in bed , " he said .
" all the telephone wires are out of commission , but to make sure that the <unk> could n't telephone i cut the wire that runs into his real estate office  and i also cut the wire up at the wadsworth house . "
" good for you , <name> ! "
returned <name> porton , and then he told of having found the two cards , each containing <name> 's signature .
" that 's fine ! "
cried the man .
" that ought to help you a great deal when you ask for the miniatures . "
" i <name> it does , " answered <name> porton , thoughtfully .
" now let us go ; the sooner we get at this affair the better . "
and then both left the barn , entered the cutter , and drove rather slowly in the direction of the basswood home .
chapter xv the return to crumville " if <name> porton got my cap and overcoat he must have been staying at this hotel , " said <name> , after the announcement made by <name> .
" let us interview the proprietor without delay . "
he and his chums hurried back into the hotel and there met not only the proprietor but also his son .
" see here , have you anybody staying here who looks like me ? "
demanded our hero of both of them .
" sure , we 've got a fellow who looks like you , " declared the hotel-keeper 's son before his father could speak .
" it 's a mr. jones .
he has a room up on the third floor .
he 's here with an older man named brown . "
" i wish you would take me up to their room ! "
cried <name> , quickly .
" why !
what 's the matter now ? "
" i want to find out whether that fellow is still here .
if he is i want him placed under arrest . "
and then <name> related a few of the particulars concerning <name> porton and his doings .
" that certainly is a queer story , " remarked the hotel proprietor .
" i 'll go upstairs with you . "
he led the way , followed by <name> and his chums .
the youths were much astonished to see him halt at the door next to their own .
" they do n't seem to be there , or otherwise they are sleeping pretty soundly , " remarked the hotel proprietor , after he had knocked on the door several times .
" i guess you had better unlock the door , " suggested <name> .
" i rather think you <name> find the room empty . "
a key was secured from one of the maids and the door was opened .
the proprietor gave one look into the apartment .
" gone ! "
he exclaimed .
" say !
do you think they have run away ? "
" that 's just exactly what i do think , " answered <name> .
" and that fellow who looks like me most likely took my cap and overcoat . "
" and you say his name is porton ?
he signed our register as <name> jones . "
" here 's his hat and coat , " announced <name> , opening the door to a closet .
" pretty poor clothing he left you in return for yours , <name> , " continued the shipowner 's son , after an inspection .
the hotel proprietor was very <unk> , declaring that porton and his companion owed him for three days ' board .
" they 're swindlers , that 's what they are ! "
he cried .
" just wait till i land on them !
i 'll put them in jail sure ! "
" i 'd willingly give you that board money just to get my hands on <name> porton , " announced <name> .
he turned to his chums .
" this sure is the limit !
first he goes to the stores and gets a lot of things in my name and then he steals my hat and overcoat right from under my nose ! "
" yes , and that is n't the worst of it , " declared <name> .
" there is no telling where he has gone ; and even if you knew , in this awful storm it would be next to impossible to follow him . "
all went below , and there they continued to discuss the situation .
in the midst of the talk the girls came down , accompanied by dr. renwick and his wife .
" oh , <name> !
you do n't mean to tell me that that horrid <name> porton has been at more of his tricks ! "
cried <name> .
" is n't it perfectly dreadful ! "
put in <name> .
" and to think he was right in this hotel with us and we never knew it ! "
" that 's what makes me so angry , " announced <name> .
" if only i had clapped my eyes on him ! "
he added regretfully .
" well , there 's no use of crying over spilt milk , " declared <name> .
" he is gone , and so are <name> 's overcoat and his cap , and that is all there is to it . "
" speaking of milk puts me in mind of breakfast , " put in <name> .
" now that the others are downstairs do n't you think we had better have something to eat ? "
all were agreeable , and soon they were seated at a large table in the dining room , in company with the doctor and mrs. renwick .
here , while eating their breakfast , they discussed the situation from every possible standpoint , but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion .
" porton must have seen us when we came up to the rooms , " said <name> to his chums .
" he probably heard me speak about leaving my cap and overcoat downstairs , and he just took a fiendish delight in walking off with them and leaving his old duds behind .
oh , he certainly is a peach ! "
had there been the slightest <unk> in the blizzard , <name> and his chums would have gone out on a hunt around the town for porton and his unknown companion .
but with the wind blowing almost a hurricane , and the snow coming down as thickly as ever , dr. renwick told them that they had better remain indoors .
" it is n't likely that they stayed anywhere around here , fearing detection , " said the physician .
" they probably put a good distance between themselves and this hotel .
and to go out in such a storm as this might make some of you sick . "
" oh , well , what of that ?
we have a doctor handy , " answered <name> , <unk> .
" just the same , i guess we had better remain where we are , " he added , with a deep sigh .
it was not until the following morning that the wind died down and the snow ceased to fall .
in the meantime , the young folks did what they could to entertain themselves , the girls playing on the piano in the hotel parlor , and the boys later on taking them to the bowling alleys next door and <unk> them into the mysteries of the game .
<name> was a good <unk> and so was <name> , each being able occasionally to make a score of two hundred .
but <name> and <name> could not do much better than one hundred , while none of the girls got over eighty .
" now that the snow has stopped falling , i suppose we had better try to get back to crumville , " said <name> to her brother .
" yes , we ought to get back , " put in <name> .
" i suppose our folks are dreadfully worried about us . "
" it was too bad that you could n't send some sort of word , " came from <name> .
" if you could only do that we could stay here until the roads were well broken . "
" in the west we do n't pretend to go out in such a storm , " remarked <name> <unk> .
" but , of course , our distances are greater , and we have so few landmarks that it is an easy thing to get lost . "
" i do n't think we are going to get away from here in any great hurry , " replied <name> .
" it is true the snow has stopped coming down and the sun is breaking through the clouds ; but i am quite sure the drifts on the road between here and crumville are much higher than we can manage , even with the powerful horses we have .
we 'll have to wait until the roads are more or less broken . "
our hero was right about not getting away .
they went down to the stables and interviewed washington bones and several of the other drivers present , and all agreed that it would not be possible to get very far beyond the town limits .
this news made the young folks chafe considerably , but there was nothing to be done ; so for another day they had to content themselves as best they could .
during that time the boys did their best to send some message to crumville , but without success , for all of the telephone and telegraph wires were still down and nothing had been done to mend them .
the next morning , however , things looked a little brighter .
the weather continued to improve , and several horse teams , as well as an ox team , came through on the road from the direction of crumville .
" the road ai n't none too good so far as i could see , " announced one of the drivers to <name> .
" but if you take your time and watch where you're going , maybe you can get through . "
" oh , let us try it anyway ! "
cried <name> , who was present .
" if we find we ca n't make it we can come back here , or else stop at some other place along the way . "
it was finally agreed that they should make the effort , and they started about ten o'clock .
the sun was shining with dazzling brilliancy on the snow , and with no wind blowing it was considerably warmer than it had been on the journey to <name> .
all of the young folks were in good humor , <name> for the time being dismissing from his mind the trouble occasioned by the loss of his cap and overcoat .
as they drove away from the town they could see the effects of the great wind .
in some spots the road was almost bare of snow , while in others there were drifts ten and twelve feet in height .
to drive through such drifts was , of course , impossible ; so they had to make long <unk> through the surrounding fields .
at such places the horses , of course , had to be driven with extra care , for no one wanted the sleigh to land in some hole or be overturned .
occasionally , when the turnout was on a dangerous slant , the girls would shriek and the boys would hold their breath ; but each time washington bones was equal to the occasion and brought them through safely .
by noon they had covered five miles , and then they stopped to rest at a village where all procured a good hot dinner .
then they went forward once again , this time through a long patch of timber .
" if we gits through dat , we 'll be all right , " declared the colored driver .
the snow lay deep in the woods , but the horses proved equal to the occasion , and at last the timber was left behind and they came out on a ridge road where the snow was only a few inches in depth .
here they were able to make fairly good time , so that three o'clock found them almost within sight of the outskirts of crumville .
" we 're going to make it easily , " declared <name> .
but he proved to be mistaken , for a little distance farther on they ran again into the deep snow and had to pass around one drift after another , finally going clear across several fields to another highway .
as a result it was well after dark before they gained the road leading past the wadsworth jewelry works .
" well , this looks like home , anyway , " declared <name> to <name> , as he nodded in the direction of her father 's establishment .
" yes , and i 'm glad of it , " returned the girl .
" gracious !
it seems to me that we have been on the road for a week ! "
" we can be thankful that we got through so easily , <name> .
wash is certainly some driver . "
on account of another big drift they had to pass to still another road , and this brought them finally to the street leading past the basswood home .
" if it 's all the same to you folks , i 'll get off at my place , " announced <name> .
" i suppose my father and mother are worrying about me . "
" go ahead , <name> , " returned <name> .
and then he added quickly : " i trust you find your father is better . "
with a flourish washington bones <name> up the panting horses in front of the basswood place .
just as <name> leaped from the sleigh the front door of the house opened and mrs. basswood appeared .
" <name> !
<name> !
is that you ? "
cried the youth 's parent , quickly .
" yes , mother , " he answered cheerily .
" do n't worry .
i am all right . "
forgetful that she had on only thin shoes , and no covering over her head or shoulders , mrs. basswood ran directly down to the big sleigh .
she glanced over the occupants and her eyes fastened instantly on <name> .
" <name> , have you been with <name> since you went away ? "
she queried .
" you have n't been to our house ? "
" why certainly i have n't been here , mrs. basswood , " he returned promptly .
" then it 's true !
it 's true ! "
she wailed , wringing her hands .
" what 's true , mother ? "
demanded the son .
" the miniatures !
they 're gone !
they have been stolen !
that young man who looks like <name> was here and took them away ! "
chapter xvi how the miniatures disappeared " the miniatures are gone ? "
came from <name> basswood in astonishment .
" yes , <name> , gone ! "
and the mother wrung her hands in despair .
" do you mean to say <name> porton dared to come here and <unk> me and get them ? "
cried <name> .
" it must have been that fellow , <name> .
he looked exactly like you .
that is why i just asked you if you had been to our house . "
" i have been with <name> and the others since we went on our <unk> , " said our hero .
" this is terrible !
how did it happen ? "
" come into the house and i 'll tell you all about it , " answered mrs. basswood .
her face was drawn with anxiety , and all could see that she was suffering keenly .
" and how is father ? "
questioned <name> , as the party trooped up the piazza steps and into the house .
" he is n't so well , <name> , as he was before you went away .
oh , dear !
and to think how easily i was <unk> ! "
<name> had told washington bones to wait for them , and , entering the parlor of the basswood home , the others listened to what the <name> of the house had to tell .
" your father had just had another bad turn , and the nurse and i were doing what we could for him when the door-bell rang , " she began .
" i went downstairs , and there stood somebody that i thought was <name> .
i asked him into the house and he at once wanted to know how mr. basswood was getting along . "
" when was this ? "
questioned <name> .
" this was two days ago , and just about noon time . "
" two days ago ! "
repeated <name> .
" then porton must have come here right after leaving the hotel in <name> .
how ever did he get here ? "
" maybe he took that train that got through from <unk> , " answered <name> .
" you remember we heard that quite a few people made that train . "
" let us hear about the miniatures , " broke in <name> , impatiently .
" well , he came in , as i said , and asked about mr. basswood 's health .
then he told me that he was in a great hurry  that a certain famous <name> critic had called on mr. wadsworth , and , having heard about the enos miniatures , was very anxious to see them .
he told me that the <name> critic had thought of coming over with him , but mr. wadsworth had said that it might disturb mr. basswood too much to have the miniatures examined in our house .
the <name> critic did not want to become snowbound in crumville , so he was only going to stay until the four o'clock afternoon train .
the young man said mr. wadsworth wanted to know if we would allow him to take the miniatures over to the wadsworth house , and that he would bring them back safely , either that evening or the next morning . "
" oh , mother !
did n't you suspect it might be a trick ? "
questioned <name> , anxiously .
" you knew how this <name> porton has been <unk> <name> . "
" yes , yes , <name> , i know , " answered mrs. basswood , again wringing her hands .
" and i should have been more careful .
but you know i was very much upset on account of the bad turn your father had had .
then , too , the young man threw me off my guard by asking me if i had one of those cards which <name> had distributed among the storekeepers  the one with his autograph on it .
" i said 'no , ' but told him i was very well acquainted with his handwriting .
then he said he would write out a card for me , adding , with a laugh , that he wanted me to be sure he was really <name> .
he <name> a blank card out of his pocket and turned to a table to write on it and then handed it to me .
here is the card now ; " and , going to the mantelpiece , the <name> of the house produced it .
" one of the cards that i left in the overcoat that was stolen ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" he did n't write this at all , mrs. basswood .
that rascal stole my overcoat and some of these cards were in it .
he simply pretended to write on it . "
" well , i was sure it was your handwriting , and that made me feel easy about the fellow being you . "
" but you knew i was with <name> and the others on the <unk> , " broke in <name> .
" oh , i forgot to state that when he came in he explained that you were all <unk> at the hotel in <name> and that , as the telephone and telegraph wires were all down , he had managed to get to <unk> and reach crumville on a freight train , doing this so that we and the wadsworths would not worry , thinking the <unk> had been lost somewhere on the road in this awful blizzard . "
" and then you gave him the miniatures ? "
questioned <name> .
" i did .
oh , <name> , i know now how very foolish it was !
but i was so upset !
at first i thought to ask your father about it ; but i was afraid that to disturb him would make him feel worse , and i knew he was bad enough already .
then , too , i knew that mr. wadsworth was expecting some <name> critics to look at the miniatures , so i concluded it must be all right .
i have always known the combination of your father 's safe , so it was an easy matter for me to open it and get the miniatures out .
i told the young man to be careful of them , and he told me not to worry  that the miniatures would be perfectly safe , and that mr. wadsworth had promised to get the critic to set a fair value on each of them . "
" was this <name> porton alone ? "
asked <name> .
the girls , of course , had listened with as much interest as the boys to what the <name> of the house had to relate .
" no , he came in a cutter driven by a man who was so bundled up because of the cold that i could not make out who he was .
as soon as i gave him the cases containing the miniatures the young man hurried off in the cutter , stating that the sooner the critic had a chance to see the paintings the better . "
" and what happened next ? "
questioned <name> , as mrs. basswood paused in her recital .
" i went back to assist a nurse who had come in , and all that night we had our hands full with my husband .
we had to call in the doctor , and he was really not out of danger until noon of the next day .
i had wanted to tell him about sending the miniatures over to the wadsworth house , but he was in no condition to be told anything , so i kept silent . "
" but did n't you get worried when noon came and the supposed <name> did n't return with them ? "
questioned the son .
" yes , as soon as the doctor said that your father was out of danger i began to worry over the miniatures .
i waited until the middle of the afternoon , and then , although it was snowing and blowing something awful , i hailed a passing man  old <name> patterson  and asked him if he would go on an errand to the wadsworth house .
he said he would try to make it for a dollar , and so i wrote a short note to mrs. wadsworth , knowing that she must be at home even though her husband and <name> might be away .
" old patterson delivered this message , and mrs. wadsworth sent back word that she had not seen anything of <name> since he had gone away on the <unk> , nor had she seen anything of the miniatures .
she added that her husband had gone to the jewelry works , but that she would send one of the hired men after him at once and acquaint him with the situation . "
" what did you do then ? "
went on <name> .
" i really did n't know what to do .
your father was so ill that the nurse and i had to give him every attention .
i was waiting for the doctor to come again , but he could not get here on account of the <unk> .
mr. wadsworth put in an appearance about two hours later , and then i told him just what i have told you .
he declared at once that it must be a trick , stating that <name> had not been near the house since going away with all of you young folks .
mr. wadsworth was quite put out , and wanted to know how it was that i had not been able to detect the deception . "
" well , i must say  " commenced <name> , and then stopped short , for he could see how his mother was suffering .
" oh , yes , <name> , i know what you were going to say , " she broke in quickly .
" having known <name> so many years i should have discovered the deception .
but , as i said before , i was terribly worked up over your father 's condition .
then , too , the young man came in bundled up in an overcoat and a cap that looked exactly like those <name> wears . "
" they were mine .
that fellow stole them from me , " interrupted our hero , bitterly .
" not only that , but he had a <unk> placed over his head and around his neck , and he spoke in a very hoarse voice , stating that he had caught a terrible cold while on the <unk> and while coming back to crumville on the freight train .
he spoke about mr. basswood 's real estate business , and about mr. and mrs. wadsworth and <name> , and so many other things that we are familiar with , that i was completely deceived .
then , too , his turning over that written card to me also threw me off my guard .
but i know i was very foolish , very foolish indeed ! "
and mrs. basswood 's lips trembled and she wrung her hands once again .
" what did mr. wadsworth do ? "
questioned <name> , in the midst of rather an awkward pause .
he agreed with <name> that mrs. basswood should have recognized <name> porton as an <unk> , but he did not want to say anything that might add to the <name> 's misery .
" he said he would set the authorities at work and see if he could not find porton and his confederate .
i was so bewildered that i  well , i might as well admit it  i told him that i could n't understand how i had been deceived , and that maybe <name> had gotten the miniatures after all . "
" oh , mrs. basswood , you did n't really mean that ! "
cried our hero .
" i was so bewildered i did n't know what i meant , <name> .
that young man did look so very much like you .
that 's the reason , when you folks drove up to the house , i ran out to ask if you had really been here or not . "
" have you heard anything of this <name> porton since ? "
asked <name> .
" i have n't heard anything .
whether mr. wadsworth has learned anything or not i do not know , for he has not been here and the storm has been so awful , with all the telephone wires down , that i could not send for news . "
" does father know about this now ? "
questioned <name> .
" no , <name> , i have not had the courage to tell him , " answered the mother .
" i told the doctor , and he advised that i say nothing for the present . "
" i do n't think i 'd tell him , " said <name> .
" i think the best thing we can do is to try to follow porton and this fellow with him and get back the miniatures .
then it <name> be time enough to tell mr. basswood about the affair . "
as soon as they had entered the parlor the <name> of the house had shut the door , so that none of the conversation might reach the sick chamber overhead .
in reply to numerous questions mrs. basswood gave all the details as to how the rascally porton had been able to gain possession of the miniatures .
" i think i 'll hurry up and get home , " declared <name> , presently .
" i want to hear what mr. wadsworth has to say ; and also find out what he and my folks have done towards getting on the track of porton and his confederate . "
" that 's the talk ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" say !
but this is the worst yet , is n't it ? "
he turned to the <name> of the house .
" i am awfully sorry for you , mrs .
basswood . "
" i guess we are all sorry , " broke in our hero , quickly .
" oh , i <name> they catch that porton and put him in prison ! "
cried <name> .
" that is where he belongs , " answered <name> , soberly .
chapter xvii a vain search to find out what mr. wadsworth , as well as <name> 's father and his uncle , had done , <name> accompanied the other young folks to the jewelry manufacturer 's mansion .
they found that mr. wadsworth had gone to business , but the other men were present and were much interested in what <name> and his chums had to relate .
" we 've done all we could to get the authorities on the trail of <name> porton , " announced <name> 's father ; " but we have been much hindered on account of this awful blizzard .
the telegraph and telephone wires are down in all directions , so it has been practically impossible to send word any great distance . "
" with such a storm it may be possible that porton and his confederate are still in crumville , " suggested <name> .
" i hardly think that , " said dunston <name> .
" more than likely they did everything they could to put distance between themselves and this town after they got their hands on the miniatures . "
" i suppose you know we found out that porton 's confederate managed to get a horse and cutter from <unk> 's livery stable , " said dave's father .
" no , we did n't know that ! "
cried <name> .
" well , it 's true .
the confederate , who gave his name as <name> <name> , said he wanted the turnout to go for a doctor .
he said he had been sent by mr. <name> , the minister .
of course , it was all a trick and mr. <name> knew absolutely nothing about it . "
" did they return the horse and cutter ? "
" they did not .
and <unk> is mourning the loss of a good horse .
the cutter he says did not amount to so much .
he would not have let the animal go out , only the fellow begged so hard , stating that it was practically a case of life or death  and he offered to pay double money for the horse 's use . "
" were they seen at all ? "
questioned <name> .
" oh , yes !
a number of people who were <unk> saw them pass down the street and stop at your house .
then others saw the cutter turn in the direction of <unk> . "
" of course you tried to follow ? "
queried <name> .
" i did that , " answered dunston <name> .
" it was tough work getting through as far as the mill town .
but i managed it , and made all sorts of inquiries .
two people had seen the cutter pass the mills , but no one could give me any definite information as to which way it headed after that .
you see , it was growing dark by that time , and the snow was coming down so thickly that it was next to impossible to see any great distance in any direction . "
" well , we know they went as far as <unk> , and that 's something , " returned <name> hopefully .
" yes , but it is n't much , " came in a rather hopeless tone from <name> .
" i 'm afraid they 've got away and we 'll never see them again , or the miniatures either . "
" oh , do n't say that , <name> ! "
cried <name> , sympathetically .
" pictures , you know , are not like money .
porton and that rascal with him <name> have no easy time disposing of the miniatures . "
" i 'll tell you what they may do ! "
burst out <name> , suddenly .
" they may go to some big city and then send you word that they <name> return the miniatures provided you <name> pay them a certain amount of money for so doing . "
" say !
i believe that 's just what they <name> do ! "
cried <name> .
" <name> , i think you 've struck the nail right on the head ! "
and he looked at the girl admiringly .
" i <name> they do that  if we do n't catch them , " returned <name> .
" if those miniatures are worth anything like a hundred thousand dollars , i guess my dad would be glad enough to give five or ten thousand dollars to get them back . "
" i would n't give up the hunt yet , <name> , " urged <name> .
" just as soon as this awful storm is over i 'd let the authorities in all the big cities , as well as the little ones , know about the theft , and then they can be on the watch for porton and his confederate .
by the way , i wonder who the confederate can be . "
" i 'm sure i have n't the least idea , " answered the real estate <unk> son .
with the disappearance of the basswood fortune in their minds , neither the young folks nor the grown folks could talk about much else .
<name> and <name> told the latter 's mother how they had fallen in with dr. renwick and his wife , and how the pair had looked after the girls during their stay at the <name> hotel .
" it was nice of mrs. renwick to do that , " said the <name> of the mansion ; " but it is no more than i would expect from her .
she is a very estimable woman . "
it was rather hard for <name> and <name> to settle down to their studies on the following morning , but there was nothing they could do to help along the search for those who had taken the miniatures , and , as both youths were anxious to make up for lost time , they applied themselves as diligently as possible .
mr. ramsdell had been away , but the tutor came back that afternoon , and the two students put in a full day over their books , leaving <name> , <name> and <name> to look after the visitors from the west .
the blizzard had now ceased entirely , and by the end of the week all the roads in the vicinity of crumville were fairly well broken and some of the telegraph and telephone lines had been repaired .
the newspapers came in from the larger cities , and it was found that the blizzard had covered a wide area of the country , extending practically from the mississippi river to the atlantic seaboard .
" it 's given <name> porton and his confederate a dandy chance to get away , " was <name> 's comment .
" you 're right , <name> , " answered <name> .
" and so far it would seem that they have left no trace behind them . "
from <name> it was learned that mr. basswood was slowly improving in health .
he had asked about the miniatures , and the <name> critics who were to have visited crumville on the invitation of mr. wadsworth .
" we could n't keep the news from him any longer , " said <name> .
" when he asked about the pictures my mother broke down and had to confess that she had let porton take them , thinking he was <name> .
of course , father was very much disturbed , and the doctor had to pay an extra visit and give him something to keep him quiet .
i told him that all of us were doing everything we possibly could to get on the track of the thieves , and now he is resting in the <name> that sooner or later the miniatures <name> be recovered . "
the loss of the miniatures had taken a good deal of the fun out of <name> , and when the young folks stopping at the wadsworth mansion went out sleighing again , and for some fun skating , he begged to be excused .
" i would n't take the loss too hard , <name> , " said <name> , quietly .
" remember , if the worse comes to the worst , you are just as well off as you were before you heard of this enos fortune . "
" that is true , <name> .
but it makes me mad to think that we had such a fortune as that right in our hands and then let it get away from us . "
" i suppose your mother feels dreadfully about it ? "
" she certainly does , <name> .
why , she is n't herself at all .
sometimes i think that her worrying <name> bring on a regular fit of sickness .
she , of course , thinks that it is entirely her fault that the miniatures are gone . "
" you 'll have to do all you can to cheer her up . "
" oh , i 'm doing that !
and i do what i can to cheer up my father too .
just the same , i 'm mighty blue myself at times ; " and the real estate dealer 's son heaved a deep sigh .
at last came the day when <name> and <name> must return to their homes in the west .
on the evening before , <name> and <name> gave a little party in their honor , which was attended by over a score of the boys and girls of crumville .
the young people played games , sang , and danced to their hearts ' content , and mrs. wadsworth saw to it that ample refreshments were served to all .
[ illustration : the young people played games , sang , and danced to their hearts ' <unk>  <name> <unk> ] " oh , i 've had a perfectly lovely time ! "
declared <name> , when she and the others were on their way to the depot .
" and so have i had a lovely time , " added <name> <unk> .
" but i 'm so sorry your friend lost that fortune , " she added .
<name> had said good-bye over the telephone , the wire of which was once more in working order .
" if you ever do hear of those miniatures you must let us know , " went on <name> .
" we 'll be sure to do that , " answered <name> .
and then the train came in , and , with a final handshake all around , and with several kisses exchanged between the girls , <name> and <name> climbed on board , <name> and <name> assisting them with their suitcases .
" i 'm sorry i 'm not going with you , " cried the shipowner 's son , " but i 've promised <name> and <name> to stay a few days longer . "
" be sure to send us a letter as soon as you get back home , " cried <name> .
and then the train rolled out of the station and the visitors from the west were gone .
on the night before <name> took his departure the three chums had what they called a " <unk> " in <name> 's room .
they spoke about many things  of how they had first gone to oak hall , and of various adventures that had occurred since that time .
" the oak hall boys are becoming scattered , " said <name> .
" i don't suppose they 'll ever all get together again . "
" oh , we 'll have to meet at some future graduation exercises at the hall ! "
cried <name> .
" i ca n't think of letting such fellows as shadow hamilton , <name> beggs , and <name> day drop . "
" right you are ! "
came from <name> .
" if i can get there at all you can count on my going back to oak hall whenever there are any commencement exercises . "
" i half wish i was going into this civil engineering business with you two fellows , " continued <name> .
" but i 'm afraid i 'm not cut out for that sort of thing .
i love the sea and everything connected with ships . "
" that shows you 're a chip of the old block , " announced <name> , clapping his chum on the shoulder .
" you take after your father , <name> , and i do n't think you could do better than to follow him in his shipping business . "
" if i do follow him in that business , i tell you what you 've got to do , " announced the shipowner 's son .
" some time you 've both got to take a nice big cruise with me . "
" that would suit me down to the <unk> , " returned <name> .
" it would be fine , <name> , " answered <name> .
" but just at present , <name> and i have got to bone to beat the band if we want to pass that examination .
you must remember that being away from home on account of that blizzard put us behind quite a good deal . "
" well , you wo n't have me to worry you after to-night , " grinned the chum .
" starting to-morrow morning you and <name> can put in twenty-four hours a day over your studies , as far as i am concerned . "
" wow !
listen to that !
he 's as considerate as old job haskers used to be , " exclaimed the senator 's son .
and then , picking up a pillow , he shied it at <name> 's head .
another pillow was sent at <name> in return ; and in a moment a so-called " oak hall pillow fight " was in full progress in the room , pillows , blankets , books , and various other objects flying in all directions .
then <name> got <name> down on one of the beds and was promptly hauled off by <name> , and in a moment more the three youths were rolling over and over on the floor .
suddenly there sounded a knock on the door .
" hello !
who is that ? "
cried <name> ; and at once the three youths scrambled to their feet , <unk> their clothing as they did so .
" oh , <name> , such a noise ! "
came from his sister .
" what in the world are you doing in there ? "
" we are only bidding <name> good-bye , " answered the brother , sweetly .
chapter xviii the civil engineering examination as the days went by , and <name> and <name> continued to prepare themselves for the examination which was rapidly approaching , the authorities did all they could to locate <name> porton and his confederate .
diligent inquiries were made concerning the identity of the man who had occupied the room at <name> with the former moving-picture actor , and it was finally discovered that he was <name> crapsey , a fellow already wanted by the police for several crimes .
" it 's queer that a fellow like porton should throw in his fortunes with a man like crapsey , " was <name> 's comment .
" from all accounts crapsey is a thoroughly good-for-nothing fellow with a great liking for strong drink . "
" that shows porton 's real disposition , <name> , " answered <name> .
" if he were any kind of a <unk> or decent fellow he would n't want to put up with such a vile fellow as this <name> crapsey is represented by the police to be . "
" if crapsey is already known to the police they ought to be able to locate him sooner or later . "
" those slick criminals have a way all their own for keeping out of sight of the police . "
<name> paused for a moment .
" do you know i 've been thinking of something .
maybe this fellow , crapsey , simply used porton as a tool . "
" i do n't quite understand , <name> . "
" why , in this way : when they heard about the miniatures , and crapsey heard how much porton looked like me , and how intimate i and the wadsworths were with the <unk> , it may have been crapsey who concocted the scheme for getting possession of the miniatures .
and if he did that , it is more than likely that he <name> be the one to dispose of the pictures or send in an offer to return them for a certain amount . "
" you mean and cut <name> porton out of the deal ? "
questioned the senator 's son , quickly .
" he may not cut porton out entirely .
but the chances are that he'll let porton have as little of the returns as possible .
a professional criminal like this crapsey is n't going to let an amateur like porton in on the ground floor if he can help it . "
" maybe he 'll do porton out of it entirely .
would n't that make the moving-picture actor mad ! "
and <name> grinned over the thought .
" it is no more than porton would deserve , " answered our hero .
" just the same , i <name> the authorities capture them both and return the miniatures to mr .
basswood . "
two days before the time when <name> and <name> were to undergo the much <unk> examination in civil engineering , there came news from a country town fifteen miles beyond <unk> .
a livery <unk> there sent in word that he was boarding a horse which he thought might be the one stolen from mr. <unk> .
the crumville <unk> at once notified <name> and the local police , and the boy and an officer accompanied him to <unk> .
mr. <unk> at once recognized the horse as his own , and wanted to know how the <unk> <unk> had become possessed of the animal .
" he was left here by a man i think was this <name> crapsey the paper spoke about , " announced the livery stable keeper .
" he said he was on the road to the next town , but that the storm was too much for him , and that he wanted to leave the animal with me for a few days or a week .
he said he was rather short of cash and asked me to lend him ten dollars , which , of course , i did , as i thought the horse was ample security , " went on the livery <unk> , bitterly .
" was the fellow alone ? "
was the question which <name> put .
" he came in alone , but i think after he left the stable he was joined by another fellow down on the corner . "
the <unk> livery-stable keeper had not noticed where crapsey and his companion had gone , but thought they had made their way to the railroad station .
it was learned that a train bound for new york city had left <unk> about an hour later .
all came to the conclusion that <name> porton and <name> crapsey had taken this .
the train had been <unk> some hours along the road , but had finally reached the grand central terminal of the metropolis .
" well , this proves one thing  that porton and crapsey got as far as new york city with the miniatures , " said <name> , when he heard the news .
" yes , and new york is such a large place , with so many people in it , that it <name> be almost impossible for the authorities to trace them there . "
" that 's it , <name>  especially when you remember that this happened some time ago , so that by now the thieves may be in chicago , san <name> , or in london , <name> , or some other far-away place . "
at last came the time when <name> and <name> were to go in for the examination which meant so much to them .
they had worked hard , and mr. ramsdell had assisted them in every way possible ; yet both were rather doubtful over the outcome of the affair .
" it is n't going to be like the examinations at oak hall , " said our hero .
" mr. ramsdell admitted that it would be stiff from the word go . "
" i know that , " answered the senator 's son .
" it seems that several years ago they were a little lax , and , as a consequence , some fellows slipped through that had no right to pass .
now they have <unk> the <unk> up , so that the test is likely to be fierce . "
" oh , <name> !
what are you going to do if you do n't pass ? "
cried <name> , when he was ready to leave home .
" if i do n't pass now , <name> , i 'll simply go at my studies again and keep at them until i do pass , " he answered .
the examination which was held in the city was divided into two parts , one taking place from ten to twelve in the morning , and the other from two to five in the afternoon .
there were about thirty students present , and as far as possible each was separated from any friends he might have on hand , so that <name> sat on one side of the hall in which the examination occurred and the senator 's son sat on the other .
" well , how did you make out ? "
questioned <name> of <name> , when the two went out for their midday lunch .
" i do n't know exactly , <name> , " was the reply .
" i think , however , that i answered at least seventy per cent , of the questions correctly .
how about yourself ? "
" well , i 'm hoping that i got seventy per cent .
of them right , " returned the senator 's son .
" but maybe i did n't get above fifty or sixty per cent . "
the afternoon questions seemed to be much harder than those of the morning .
the students were given until five o'clock to pass in their afternoon papers , and never did <name> and <name> work harder than they did during the final hour .
one question in particular bothered our hero a great deal .
but at almost the last minute the answer to it came like an inspiration , and he dashed it down .
this question proved a <unk> for the senator 's son , and he passed in his paper without attempting to put down a solution .
following that examination , <name> returned to crumville .
<name> journeyed to washington , where his folks were staying at a leading hotel , congress being in session and senator morr occupying his place in the senate .
there was a week of anxious waiting , and then one day <name> received an <unk> envelope which made his heart beat rapidly .
" what is it , <name> ? "
cried his sister , when she saw him with the letter in his hand .
" is it your civil engineering report ? "
" i think it is , <name> , " he answered .
" oh , <name> , how i <name> you 've passed ! "
" so do i , " put in <name> .
<name> could not give an answer to this , because , for the moment , his heart seemed to be in his throat .
passing to the desk in the library , he slit open the envelope and took out the sheet which it contained .
a single glance at it , and he gave a shout of triumph .
" i 've passed ! "
he cried .
" hurrah ! "
" oh , good ! "
came simultaneously from his sister and <name> .
and then they crowded closer to look at the sheet of paper .
" does it say what percentage you got ? "
continued his sister .
" why , as near as i can make out , i 've got a standing of <unk> per cent. , " he announced , with pardonable pride .
" is n't that fine ? "
" it 's the finest ever , <name> ! "
said his sister , fondly , as she threw her arms around his neck .
" oh , <name> , it 's just glorious ! "
exclaimed <name> , her eyes beaming .
and when he caught her and held her tight for a moment she offered no resistance .
" oh , wo n't your father and your uncle be proud when they hear of this ! "
" i 'm going to tell them right now ! "
he cried , and ran off to spread the good news .
" my boy , i 'm proud of you , " said his father .
" proud of you ! "
and he clapped <name> affectionately on the shoulder .
" i did n't expect anything different from our davy , " put in uncle dunston .
" i knew he 'd pass .
well , now you 've passed , i wish you every success in the profession you have chosen . "
" oh , i 'm not a full-fledged civil engineer yet , uncle dunston , " broke in <name> , quickly .
" i 've got a whole lot to learn yet .
remember this is only my first examination .
i 've got to study a whole lot more and have a whole lot of practice , too , before i can graduate as a real civil engineer . "
<name> lost no time in sending a telegram to <name> .
in return , a few hours later came word from the senator 's son that he , too , had passed .
" hurrah ! "
cried <name> , once more , and then could not resist the temptation to grab <name> about the waist and start on a mad dance through the library , the hallway , the dining-room , and the living room of the mansion .
mrs. wadsworth looked on and smiled <unk> .
" i suppose your heart is as light as a feather now , <name> , " she said , when the impromptu whirl came to an end .
" indeed it is , mrs. wadsworth , " he answered .
" passing that examination has lifted a tremendous weight from my shoulders . "
of course mr. ramsdell was greatly pleased to think that both of his pupils had passed .
" now i can write to my friends of the mentor construction company and see if they can give <name> and <name> an opening , " he said .
" they promised it to me some time ago in case the boys passed . "
and he set about sending off a letter without delay .
chapter xix off for texas " glorious news ! "
" oh , <name> !
have you heard from mr .
ramsdell ? "
cried his sister <name> .
" yes , here is a letter .
and it enclosed another from the mentor construction company .
they are going to give me an opening with that portion of the concern that is now operating in texas , building railroad bridges . "
" oh , <name> !
then you <name> really have to go away down there ? "
burst out <name> , her face falling a trifle .
" it 's a dreadfully long way off ! "
" well , it 's what i expected , " he answered .
" a fellow ca n't expect to become a civil engineer and work in his own <unk> , " and he grinned a trifle .
" this letter from mr. ramsdell states that <name> <name> be given an opening also . "
" with you , of course ? "
queried <name> .
" he does n't state that .
but he knew we wanted to stick together , so i suppose it 's all right . "
" when do you have to start ? "
questioned <name> .
" just as soon as we can get ready  according to mr. ramsdell 's letter .
he says he is also sending word to <name> . "
as was to be expected , the tidings quite excited our hero .
now that he had passed the preliminary examination and was to go out for actual field practice , he felt that he was really and truly on his way to becoming a civil engineer .
it was the first step towards the realization of a dream that had been his for some time .
<name> 's father and his uncle , as well as mr. and mrs. wadsworth , were greatly interested in the news .
" there is one thing about it , <name> , " said his parent ; " i have made a number of inquiries , and have learned that the mentor construction company is one of the largest and finest in this country .
they employ a number of first-class engineers ; so it is likely that you <name> receive the very best of instruction , and i sincerely <name> that you <name> make the best of your opportunities . "
" i am going to do my level best , dad , " he returned earnestly .
" i think i 'm a mighty lucky boy , " he added , with a smile .
" i think you owe mr. ramsdell a good deal , " said his uncle dunston .
" of course , we have paid him for his services , but that isn't everything . "
" i know it , " <name> returned ; " and i 'm either going to thank him in person or else send him the nicest letter that i can write . "
now that he was really going to leave home , mrs. wadsworth , as well as <name> and <name> , took it upon their shoulders to see that <name> should be properly taken care of so far as wearing apparel went .
" but oh , <name> !
it 's awful to think of your going so far away ! "
said <name> , one day , when the two were alone in the library .
" the house <name> be dreadfully lonely after you are gone . "
" it wo n't be much different from when i was at oak hall , <name> , " he answered .
" oh , yes , it <name> be , <name> .
texas is a long way off .
and my father says the construction work that the mentor company is doing is close to the mexican border .
what if you should have trouble with some of those awful mexican bandits ? "
and the girl shuddered .
" i do n't expect any trouble of that kind .
practically all the fighting that has been going on has been on mexican soil on the other side of the rio grande .
as i understand it , the nearest point that the mentor construction company reaches to mexico is some miles from the border . "
" well , that 's close enough with so much fighting going on , " <name> pouted .
" i do n't want any of those awful mexican revolutionists to fire at you . "
" do n't worry , <name> , " <name> answered ; and then caught her by both hands and <name> her closer .
" you 're going to write to me regularly , are n't you ? "
he continued , earnestly .
" of course , <name> !
and do n't you forget to answer every letter , " she replied quickly .
" oh , i 'll do that , never fear ! "
" and do you really think you are going to enjoy becoming a civil engineer ? "
" i 'm positive of it , <name> .
the more i see of the profession , the more i am in love with it .
it 's a wonderful thing .
just think of being able to plan out a great big bridge across a broad river , or some wonderful dam , or a tall <unk> , or an elevated railroad , or a tunnel under a gigantic mountain , or a tube under some river , or  " " oh , my gracious me , <name> !
are you going to do all those wonderful things ? "
gasped the girl , her eyes opening widely .
" i do n't expect i 'll ever have the chance to do all those things , <name> ; but i 'm going to try my best to do some of them .
of course , you must remember that at the present time civil engineering is divided into a great many branches .
now , for instance , i didn't mention anything about mining engineering , and that 's a wonderful profession in itself . "
" oh , <name> !
it 's wonderful  simply wonderful ! "
cried the girl .
" and you are going to be a wonderful man  i know it ! "
and she looked earnestly into his eyes .
" if i ever do get to be a wonderful man , it 's going to be on your account , <name> , " he returned in a low voice .
" you have been my inspiration .
do n't forget that ; " and he <name> her closer than before .
" oh , <name> ! "
" it 's true , <name> .
and i only <name> that i 'll make good  and that too before i am very much older .
then i think you already know what i am going to do ? "
" what ? "
she whispered , and dropped her eyes .
" i am going to ask your folks for your hand in marriage , " he continued firmly , reading his answer in her face .
word had come in from <name> that he too was getting ready to go to texas , and that both of the youths were to work together , as had been anticipated .
as the senator 's son was in washington , it was arranged that <name> was to join him in the capitol city , and then the two were to journey to texas .
<name> had heard about <name> 's proposed departure for the south , and he came over several times to see his former oak hall chum before the latter left home .
" any news regarding the miniatures ? "
questioned <name> , during the last of these visits .
" not much , " answered the real estate dealer 's son .
" the police thought they had one or two clues , but they have all turned out to be false .
they arrested one fellow in pittsburgh , thinking he was <name> crapsey , but he turned out to be somebody else . "
" then they have n't any word at all about <name> porton ? "
" no , that rascal seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth . "
" how is your father getting along , <name> ? "
" he is n't doing so well , <name> .
this loss of the miniatures was a terrible blow to him .
you see , the real estate business lately has not been quite as good as it might be .
my father went into several pretty heavy investments , and he needed a little more money to help him through .
so when he got word about this fortune in pictures , he at once thought that he could sell some of the miniatures and use the proceeds in his real estate deals .
now that end of the business is at a standstill . "
" is your father actually suffering for the want of some cash ? "
asked our hero , quickly .
" if he is , i think my father or my uncle dunston can help him out . "
" your father has already promised to assist him , and so has mr. wadsworth , <name> .
but that is n't the thing .
you know my father is an independent sort of man , and it worries him to think that he can't stand entirely on his own feet in his real estate transactions .
of course , if he were well enough to be around i suppose he could adjust matters without any special assistance .
but it 's hard lines when things go wrong and you are flat on your back in bed . "
" yes , i can understand that .
and it must worry your mother , too . "
" oh , it does !
<name> is n't the same woman .
she is awfully pale and quite thin .
the doctor told her not to worry so , or she 'd be down on her back , too . "
" well , you 'll have to do what you can to cheer up both of them . "
<name> <name> a long breath .
" i do wish somebody would catch those two rascals , not only on your account but on my account also .
i 'd like to settle matters with porton , for having <unk> me at those stores , and for taking my cap and overcoat . "
" we 've offered a reward of five thousand dollars for the return of the miniatures , and another thousand each for the capture of the thieves , " announced <name> .
" that ought to be a strong inducement for the detectives to do all they possibly can . "
" we thought you might possibly get an offer from porton or crapsey , or both of them , to return the miniatures for a certain amount , " went on <name> .
" but you say no such offer has come in ? "
" no . "
" would your father consider it if it did come in ? "
" i do n't know what he would do , <name> .
of course , he 'd hate to give up money to a thief ; but , just the same , he 'd hate it worse if he never got the miniatures back . "
at last came the time for <name> to leave home .
his trunk had been packed and shipped on ahead .
there was still considerable snow on the ground ; so he was taken to the depot in the big wadsworth sleigh , the girls and his father accompanying him .
" good-bye , davy , my boy ! "
cried his uncle dunston , when he was ready to leave the house .
" now i expect you to give a good account of yourself while with that construction company . "
" i 'll do what i can , " he answered .
" and do keep away from the mexicans , " added mrs. wadsworth with a sigh .
" you trust <name> to do the right thing , " came from old caspar potts , his mellow eyes beaming brightly .
" <name> is all right .
he 's my boy , and i 'm proud of him , " and he nodded his head over and over again .
for the girls , the drive to the depot was all too short .
<name> had so many things to say to her brother that she hardly knew what to speak of first .
as for poor <name> , she felt so bad she could scarcely speak , and when she looked at <name> there were <unk> tears in her eyes .
" now do n't look at it that way , " <name> whispered , when he caught sight of the tears .
" i 'll be back again before a great while . "
" oh , <name> , i  i  ca  ca n't help it , " she murmured .
" i  i  think so  so  much of  of  you ! "
and then , for the moment , she hid her face on his shoulder .
mr. <name> had a few words of advice to give , and he had hardly finished when the train rolled into the station .
then <name> shook hands with his father , and kissed each of the girls , and climbed on board .
" good-bye , my son ! "
called mr. <name> .
" good-bye , dad !
take care of yourself while i 'm gone , " he shouted back .
" good-bye , <name> !
good-bye , <name> ! "
" good-bye , <name> ! "
returned the sister , waving her hand .
<name> tried to speak but could not , and so she too waved a farewell .
then the train rolled from the crumville station , slowly gathering speed , and finally disappearing in the distance .
at last our hero was off to become a full-fledged civil engineer .
chapter xx in new york city " <name> <name> ! "
" <name> beggs ! "
cried our hero , his face lighting up .
" where in the world did you come from ? "
" just got off the accommodation coming the other way , " announced <name> beggs , otherwise known as <name> , a fat youth who had long been one of <name> 's oak hall classmates .
" are you alone ? "
questioned our hero .
he had just stepped from the local train to change to the express for new york city ; and he had fairly run into <name> , who was standing on the platform flanked by several suitcases .
" no , i 'm not alone , " answered the fat youth .
" shadow hamilton and <name> watson are with me . "
" you do n't say so ! "
and our hero 's face showed his pleasure .
" are you bound for new york ? "
he questioned quickly .
" yes , we are going to take the express . "
" fine !
i am going there myself . "
" got a seat in the parlor car ? "
" yes .
number twelve , car two . "
" is n't that wonderful !
we have eleven , thirteen and fourteen ! "
answered <name> beggs .
" hello there , <name> <name> ! "
shouted another youth , as he stepped out of the waiting-room of the depot .
" how are you anyway ? "
and he came up , swinging a <unk> from his right hand to his left so that he might shake hands .
<name> watson had always been one of the favorite musicians at oak hall , playing the banjo and the guitar very nicely , and singing well .
" mighty glad to see you , <name> ! "
cried <name> , and wrung the extended hand with such vigor that the former musician of oak hall winced .
then <name> looked over the other 's shoulder and saw a third lad approaching  a youth who was as thin as he was tall .
" how is our little boy , shadow , to-day ? "
he continued , as <name> hamilton came closer .
" great <name> !
am i blind or is it really <name> <name> ? "
burst out shadow hamilton .
" no , you 're not blind , shadow , and it 's really yours truly , " laughed <name> .
and then as another handshake followed he continued : " what are you going down to new york city for ?
to pick up some new stories ? "
" pick up stories ? "
queried the former story teller of oak hall , in perplexity .
" i do n't have to pick them up .
i have  " " about fourteen million stories in pickle , " broke in <name> beggs .
" fourteen million ! "
snorted <name> watson .
" you had better say about fourteen !
shadow tells the same stories over and over again . "
" say , that puts me in mind of a story ! "
cried the youth mentioned , his face lighting up .
" once on a time there was a  " " oh , my , shadow !
are you going to start right away ? "
demanded <name> , with a broad grin on his face .
" ca n't you give a fellow a chance to catch his breath ?
this is a great surprise  meeting you three on my way to the city .
and to think we are going to be together in one of the parlor cars , too ! "
" oh , you ca n't lose the oak hall boys ! "
cried <name> .
" say , let me tell you something , " he went on .
" <name> has written a song about oak hall that is about the finest thing i ever heard . "
" it ought to be if it mentions us , " answered <name> , with a boldness that took away much of the conceit .
" say , you have n't let me tell that story ! "
interrupted shadow , with a disconcerted look on his thin face .
" now , as i was saying , there was once a  " " not now , shadow ! "
" you can tell it on the way to new york ! "
" provided the conductor <name> give you written permission . "
" not much ! "
returned the would-be story-teller .
" if i ca n't tell that story now , i 'm going to be mum forever . "
he suddenly looked at <name> .
" what is taking you to new york ? "
he inquired .
" i 'm on my way to texas , " answered <name> , and then told his former classmates of how he and <name> had passed the preliminary examination as civil engineers and of how they were now going to take up field work in the lone <name> state .
" say , that 's great ! "
exclaimed <name> , in admiration .
" i wish i was going to do something like that . "
" so do i , " added <name> , while shadow nodded in assent .
the other lads had many questions to ask , and in return told <name> much about themselves .
in the midst of the conversation the express train for the metropolis rolled in and the four youths lost no time in clambering aboard .
they found their seats with ease , and quickly settled themselves .
" that 's a fierce loss that the <unk> sustained , " remarked <name> .
" i read all about it in the newspapers .
that fellow , <name> porton , must be a peach . "
" i should say he was a lemon so far as <name> was concerned , " said <name> , with a slow wink of his eye .
" speaking of peaches puts me in mind of another story , " cried shadow .
" a man had a tree in his garden and  " " oh , shadow , why this infliction ! "
" have we really got to listen ? "
" how much <name> you pay us if we keep still until you have finished ? "
" yes , you 've got to listen , and i wo n't pay you a cent for it , either , " retorted the would-be story-teller .
" this is a short one .
a man had a <unk> in his garden , and he told a friend of his that he got three kinds of fruit from it .
his friend did n't believe it , so he told his friend : 'why , it was dead easy .
i went out in the garden to pick an apple .
i picked one , and then i picked a pair .
one was no good , but another was a peach . ' "
" wow !
listen to that ! "
" shadow must have had a peach of a time getting up that story , " commented <name> , evidently feeling himself justified .
" good thing there are not a pair of them , " came from <name> .
" such stories are the fruits of idleness , " was added by <name> , solemnly .
" oh , do n't you poke fun at that joke , " retorted shadow .
" it 's a good deal better than any you could get up . "
<name> learned that <name> watson 's folks were now living in new york city , and that <name> had invited <name> and shadow to spend a week with him .
" it 's too bad you ca n't stop off , at least for a day or two , " said <name> to <name> .
" it would suit me down to the ground to have you join us . "
" and i 'd like first-rate to do it , <name> , " answered our hero .
" but i promised to be in washington by to-morrow , and that means that i've got to take the midnight train from new york city . "
" well , we 'll get down to new york by three o'clock this afternoon .
that <name> give us nine hours in which to have a good time .
you 've got to come up to our house for dinner , " continued <name> ; and so it was arranged .
" i was wondering what i would do with myself this evening , " said our hero .
" i do n't mind going around the city in the daylight , but after it is dark it is rather hard for a stranger to put in his time , unless he wants to go to some kind of show . "
" we might all go to a moving-picture show after dinner , " suggested <name> .
" i 'll blow you to front seats , " he added generously .
" you 'll have to make it a seat farther back than that for me , " put in shadow .
" a front seat at a moving-picture show is no good , " and at this there was a general snicker .
" we 'll see about the show after we have had dinner , " said <name> .
the time on the train was spent in talk about oak hall and their numerous classmates , many of them now well scattered throughout the states .
" <name> vane has gone into business , so i hear , " announced <name> .
" he's in real estate , and in spite of the fact that he 's a regular dude they tell me he is doing very well . "
" well , <name> ought to do well , " answered <name> , who had not forgotten that the student who acted so very <unk> had at graduation stood as high in his percentage as our hero himself had done .
" and they say chip macklin is doing pretty well , too , " put in <name> , referring to a small lad who had once been a toady to <name> plum , the hall bully .
" well , plum is doing well , " returned <name> .
" i 'm glad he reformed .
evidently there was much better stuff in him than there was in jasniff and merwell . "
" oh , jasniff and merwell were thoroughly bad eggs , " announced <name> .
" i 'll never forget , <name> , how jasniff once tried to <name> you with an indian club . "
" say , speaking about bad eggs , puts me in mind of another story , " cried shadow .
" a <name> went into a store and asked the <unk> clerk how much the eggs were .
the clerk  now do n't interrupt me , because this is n't a very long story , " pleaded the would-be story teller .
" the clerk was only a small boy , and he had n't been in the business very long , so he told the <name> , 'the really fresh eggs are fifty cents , and the almost fresh eggs are forty cents , and those that ai n't so fresh are thirty-five cents , and the rotten eggs are thirty cents . ' "
" oh , shadow !
what a story ! "
" have n't you got any fresher than that ? "
" you ca n't make anybody believe any such yarn as that . "
" that story is absolutely true , " returned the story teller , soberly .
" if you do n't believe it , you come down to the town of <unk> , maine , and on the principal street of the town i 'll show you the town pump where that boy used to get a drink three times a day , " and at this <name> there was a general laugh .
at last the train rolled into the grand central terminal at <unk> street , new york city , and , alighting , the lads made their way through the spacious depot to the crowded thoroughfare beyond .
here <unk> were numerous , and the youths piled into one , leaving the driver to look after their <unk> .
<name> 's trunk had been checked through to washington .
<name> 's family lived in the vicinity of central park , and it did not take the chums long to reach the home .
here they were greeted by mrs. watson , <name> 's father being away on business .
then <name> took the lads up to his own room , where all proceeded to make themselves at home .
at a little after five mr. watson came in to greet them , and about an hour later all sat down to a sumptuous dinner , to which it is needless to say each of the boys applied himself diligently .
" i see by the papers that they are showing a very fine war spectacle at one of the <unk> houses , " announced <name> .
" how would you fellows like to go and see it ? "
this was agreeable to all , and a little later the chums left the watson house to go to the theater , which was about ten blocks farther downtown .
" if we get there by half-past seven , we can take in the first show of the evening , " announced <name> .
" that <name> give us a chance to do some other things before it is time for <name> to catch his train . "
the war spectacle proved very entertaining to all the youths , and they were rather sorry when it came to an end .
then <name> proposed that they walk down the great white way , as a certain portion of broadway has been designated .
the boys had been walking for the best part of half an hour , taking in various sights , including the wonderfully illuminated signs , when suddenly , as they passed through a rather dense crowd , shadow plucked <name> by the arm .
" what is it ? "
questioned our hero , quickly , for he saw that the former story-teller of oak hall was much excited .
" that fellow we just passed , <name> ! "
cried shadow .
" what of him ? "
" why , he looked just like you ! "
" you do n't mean it ! "
gasped <name> , and came to a sudden halt .
" if he looked like me it must have been <name> porton ! "
chapter xxi <name> in washington " <name> porton ! "
exclaimed the other youths in a chorus .
" let us go after him , " went on <name> .
" shadow , which way did he go ? "
" come on , i 'll show you , " answered the story-teller , and led the way through the crowd as well as he could .
as already mentioned , the crowd at this particular spot on the great white way was dense , and the chums had all they could do to force their way along , often <unk> people in a way that was far from polite .
presently they gained a street corner where the pedestrians were being held up by the traffic flowing the other way .
" there he is ! "
exclaimed shadow , suddenly , pointing with his hand .
looking in the direction indicated , <name> saw a well-known form .
it was indeed <name> porton , still wearing the cap and overcoat he had stolen from our hero .
" hi there , porton !
stop ! "
cried <name> , and made a dash for the rascal .
as his hand fell on porton 's arm the other swung around in a startled way .
then , as he caught sight of <name> and his friends , he gave a sudden duck and crowded in between several ladies standing in front of him .
the next instant he was dashing out into the street in the midst of a perfect maze of automobiles and wagons .
[ illustration : the next instant he was dashing out into the <unk>  <name> <unk> ] " i 'm going after him ! "
cried <name> to his chums , and did his best to follow .
but an automobile got in his way , and then a large express wagon , and before our hero could get around these , porton had gained the opposite sidewalk and was darting through the crowd with great rapidity , paying scant attention to those he met and hurling one little girl off her feet and into the gutter .
" stop !
what 's the matter here ? "
cried a voice to <name> ; and the next moment a policeman came up beside him .
" that fellow ahead !
i want to catch him ! "
burst out our hero .
" he 's a thief ! "
" where ? "
" there he goes , straight into the crowd ! "
answered <name> , and then hurried on once more , with his chums trailing behind him .
the <name> so suddenly taken up did not , however , prove long .
by the time <name> and his friends reached the next corner of the crowded thoroughfare <name> porton had disappeared once more and none of the youths could tell what direction he had taken .
" i do n't know what you 're going to do , <name> , " said <name> , sympathetically .
" he may have gone ahead and then again he may have turned to the right or to the left . "
" i do n't believe you 'll be able to locate him in such a crowd as this , " put in <name> .
" what a shame that you were n't able to get your hands on him ! "
" i did have one hand on him , but he slipped away like a greased pig , " announced <name> , dolefully .
" say , speaking about greased pigs puts me in mind of a story , " put in shadow .
" once there were two boys  " and then , as his chums gave him a sudden cold look , he continued : " oh , pshaw !
what 's the use of trying to tell a story just now .
i know <name> would rather find this fellow porton . "
" you 're right there , shadow ! "
answered our hero , quickly .
" i 'd rather get my hands on him than listen to a thousand stories . "
<name> was unwilling to let the <name> end there ; so he and his friends spent the remainder of the evening walking up and down broadway , and traversing several blocks of the side streets in the vicinity where <name> porton had disappeared .
but it was all of no avail .
the rascal had made good his escape .
then all walked around to the nearest police station , and told the authorities of the affair , so that the detectives of the city might be on the watch for the criminal .
his chums insisted upon seeing <name> off on his journey to washington , and before going to the pennsylvania railroad station on seventh avenue the youths treated themselves to a lunch .
during the meal shadow was allowed to tell several of his best stories , and <name> was called on to hum over the song he had composed in honor of their days at oak hall .
" that 's a fine song , <name> , and you ought to have it published , " declared <name> , heartily .
" i believe every lad who ever went to oak hall would want a copy of it . "
it may be mentioned here that later on <name> watson did have the composition brought out by a metropolitan music publisher .
he dedicated it to the senior class of which he had been a member , and the song sold very well .
<name> had already secured his berth on the train , so that when his friends left him he lost no time in retiring .
but the novelty of the journey , and his thoughts concerning <name> porton , kept him awake for some time .
finally , however , he went sound asleep and did not awaken until some time after the capitol city was reached .
senator morr and his family were staying at the new <name> hotel in washington , and <name> soon found a street car that passed the door of that place .
when he entered the hotel , he found <name> in the lobby waiting for him .
" i thought you 'd come right up , " cried the senator 's son .
" i told the folks i 'd meet you .
of course , you have n't had any breakfast ?
the folks <name> be down in a little while and then we 'll all go to breakfast together . "
<name> was much interested to learn that <name> had met three of their old chums , and wanted to know all that had been said and done .
the fact that our hero had also seen <name> porton was a surprise .
" what a shame you did n't capture him , <name> !
maybe you might have got on the track of that basswood fortune . "
" just what i was thinking , <name> .
i did my best , but you know what a new york crowd is .
porton slipped through it and disappeared almost like magic . "
senator morr and his wife greeted <name> warmly .
the four had breakfast in a private dining-room , and during the course of the meal the senator had much to say regarding the departure of his son and <name> for texas .
" i know one or two of the men connected with the mentor construction company , " said the senator .
" they are very fine fellows , and i think they <name> see to it that you are treated rightly . "
" dad , of course , has some influence with them , " broke in <name> , " being a senator , you know . "
" i do n't use my influence that way , <name> , " answered the father , shortly .
" you must not expect special favors because i happen to be a united states senator .
i expect you to make your way on your own merit . "
" and that 's what i 'm going to do , " answered the son , promptly .
" i do <name> both of you boys keep out of trouble , " said mrs. morr .
" you are going close to the border of mexico , and there has been fighting going on along that border for many months . "
" we are not going down there to get into any fights , " answered <name> .
" we are going down there to attend strictly to business .
if the mexicans <name> only leave us alone , we 'll leave them alone . "
<name> and <name> had at first thought to go to texas by the way of new orleans and <name> , but after some thought they decided to take the journey by the way of st. <name> , kansas city and san <name> .
their train was to leave on the following morning , so that the two youths had a whole day practically to themselves .
" now i am in washington i 'd like to take a look around , " said <name> .
" i knew you 'd like to do that , so i got everything ready beforehand , " announced his chum .
" we 'll spend to-day in <unk> . "
they visited the capitol and the white house , and numerous other buildings , and almost before they were aware it was evening .
then mrs. morr insisted upon it that her son retire early , knowing what a hard journey was before him .
the senator 's son had received word that the mentor construction company had opened a temporary office at san <name> , and the two youths were to report there before proceeding farther .
the engineering corps to which they had been assigned was on the point of moving from one place to another , and they were to get definite instructions at san <name> regarding their further movements .
" well , good-bye and good luck to you ! "
said the senator , who came down to the depot with them to see them off .
" good-bye , dad , " answered <name> , shaking hands warmly .
<name> , too , shook hands with his chum 's father .
then , in a moment more , the two youths were off on their long journey to texas .
" this kind of traveling is rather different from what the pioneers put up with , " remarked <name> , as the two settled themselves in their comfortable seats , they having a whole section of the sleeper to themselves .
" think of what it must have been to travel thousands of miles in a boomer wagon behind a team of mules or oxen ! "
" yes , <name> , and think of being on the lookout constantly for unfriendly indians and wild beasts , " added <name> .
" i 'll tell you , when you come to consider the luxuries we enjoy these days we have much to be thankful for . "
the day 's run was a pleasant one , and the youths enjoyed it greatly .
they spent the time in chatting about the prospects and in gazing at the <unk> panorama to be seen from the car window .
" it 's a pity we have to sleep when there is so much to see , " was <name> 's comment , as , after having passed through cincinnati , it grew time to retire .
" i 'd like very much to see what this section of the country looks like . "
the following morning found them crossing the mississippi river .
they passed through st. <name> , and then the train headed for kansas city , where they were to change for fort worth and san <name> .
the train for san <name> proved to be much less crowded than the other had been .
as before , the youths had a section to themselves , and none of the sections near them was occupied .
but when , on the following day , the train stopped at a way station several passengers got aboard , including a man who took the section opposite to that occupied by our friends .
this man was a tall , heavy-set and red-faced individual , having reddish hair and a heavy reddish mustache .
he looked the youths over rather coldly , and then , throwing himself down in his seat , proceeded to read a newspaper .
" does n't look like a very friendly fellow , " whispered <name> to <name> .
" i was hoping we might meet somebody who would warm up a little and tell us something about this part of the country . "
" you 've got to go slow in making friends out in a strange place like this , " answered <name> .
" oh , i do n't know about that , <name> , " was the quick reply .
" my father tells me that folks in the west and southwest are usually very friendly .
we found them so on our way to <name> ranch . "
the boys continued to talk of the prospects ahead , and during the conversation the mentor construction company was mentioned several times .
then <name> noticed that the burly man opposite had dropped his newspaper and was looking at them curiously .
finally the man arose and stepped across the aisle .
" did i hear you young fellows speaking about the mentor construction company ? "
he asked , not unpleasantly .
" you did , " answered <name> .
" are you connected with that concern ? "
went on the man .
" we are going to work for them , " answered <name> .
" we have just been appointed to the engineering department . "
" you do n't say ! "
cried the man in surprise .
" i 'm with that company myself .
my name is <name> jarvey .
what is yours ? "
the boys told him , and all shook hands .
then , as <name> crossed over to sit down beside <name> , the man sank down in the seat opposite .
chapter xxii in texas at last " so you are going to join our engineering department , eh ? "
queried <name> jarvey .
" do you know anybody in that department ? "
" we do n't know any one down here , " answered <name> .
" we are utter strangers .
we obtained our positions through a mr. ramsdell , who was our tutor . "
" oh , i see . "
the man had been looking rather sharply at <name> .
" may i ask where you come from ? "
" we come from new england .
i live in a town called crumville .
my friend here is the son of united states senator morr . "
" oh , indeed ! "
<name> jarvey showed increased interest .
" the son of a united states senator , eh ?
well , that ought to help you a great deal .
the mentor construction company often has to ask the government for favors , you know , " and he laughed lightly .
" i 'm not going to trade on the fact that my father is a united states senator , " remarked <name> , somewhat shortly .
" i am going to make my own way . "
" and i guess you <name> .
you look like a pretty bright young man , " returned <name> jarvey , hastily .
" are you a civil engineer ? "
questioned <name> .
" oh , no !
no such luck for me .
i am connected with the <unk> and the <unk> department .
i wish i were a first-class civil engineer .
i might be earning a much larger salary ; " and the man <name> down his mouth as he spoke .
evidently he was a fellow who was not at all satisfied with his position in life .
" we are to report to a mr. <name> watson at san <name> , " explained <name> .
" he is to tell us where to go and what to do . "
" <name> watson , eh ? "
and the man scowled and showed his teeth in an unpleasant manner .
" what 's the matter  do n't you like mr .
watson ? "
asked <name> .
" not much .
very few of the men do .
he 's terribly sharp on watching everything a man does . "
" i sincerely <name> we do n't have any trouble with him , " was <unk> comment .
" we 'd like to start right , you know . "
" well , you 'll have to watch yourselves pretty closely , " announced <name> jarvey .
the talk then became general , and the burly man told the youths much about the work being done by the mentor construction company .
it seemed that there were four gangs in the field , two operating south of san <name> , and the others to the westward .
" it 's more than likely you 'll be sent to the west , " he said .
" i think the gangs in the south have all the helpers they need .
i am going west myself ; so if you are sent that way perhaps we 'll see more of each other . "
" perhaps , " answered <name> .
he was not particularly elated over the thought , for there was something about <name> jarvey which did not appeal to him .
the man was evidently very overbearing and had an exceedingly good opinion of himself .
" i 'm going back to have a smoke , " said the man , presently .
" <name> you come and join me ? "
" thank you , but neither of us smokes , " answered <name> .
" what !
not even cigarettes ? "
" no , " returned <name> .
" humph !
i do n't see how you can resist .
i would feel utterly lost without a cigar .
well , i 'll see you later . "
and thus speaking <name> jarvey took himself off .
" i sincerely trust the rest of the men we meet <name> be of a better sort than that fellow , " remarked <name> .
" i do n't like his make-up at all . "
" i agree with you , <name> , " answered <name> .
" he looks like a chap who would be very dictatorial if he had the chance  one of the kind who loves to ride over those under him . "
" i ca n't get over the way he kept looking at you , <name> .
he acted as if he had met you before and was trying to place you . "
" i noticed he did look at me pretty closely a number of times , " answered our hero .
" but i took it that he was only trying to size me up .
you know some strangers have that habit . "
" well , he did n't look at me that way , " continued the senator 's son .
" i believe he was doing his best to try to place you . "
" i wish i had asked him where he was from .
maybe that might have given us some sort of clue to his identity . "
" let 's ask him if we get the chance . "
on the journey to san <name> they had an opportunity to speak to <name> jarvey a number of times , and once they sat at the same table with him in the dining-car .
when asked where he came from , he replied rather <unk> that he had lived for a great number of years in the northwest , but that he had left that section of the country to try his fortunes in mexico .
" i was interested in the mines down there , and then i got mixed up in one of their revolutions and got shot in the leg , " he added .
" that was enough for me ; so i crossed the rio grande into texas , and by luck got the position i am now holding with the mentor company . "
" are the mexican revolutionists interfering at all with the work of the construction company near the border ? "
questioned <name> .
" not very much .
one gang , that was working on one of the railroad bridges not many miles from the rio grande , had a little <unk> with some raiders who came across the river to steal cattle .
they helped the ranchmen drive the raiders away , and in the fight one fellow was shot through the shoulder . "
" well , that was trouble enough ! "
cried <name> .
" it 's more than i 'd like to see . "
" that 's right , " returned <name> .
" we did n't come down to fight the mexicans .
we came down to become civil engineers . "
" oh , i do n't think you 'll run into any fighting , " answered <name> jarvey .
" but , of course , a good many of those greasers are very treacherous and there is no telling what they <name> do .
they shoot down and <name> anybody they meet in their own country , and then , when there is nothing in sight on that side of the river , they watch their chance and come over on this side .
of course , united states soldiers are on the lookout for them ; so they do n't dare to make their <unk> very public . "
it developed that <name> jarvey had been sent up to <unk> on business for the construction company .
he carried with him a heavy valise , and also a large roll of <unk> .
" i should have been back to san <name> yesterday , " he exclaimed .
" but i was delayed in <unk> .
i suppose <name> watson <name> be as mad as a hornet when i get back because i did n't make it as quick as he expected .
he expects an awful lot from those working under him . "
to this neither of the youths replied .
they had noticed that <name> jarvey smoked a great deal and that his breath smelled strongly of liquor , and they concluded that he was not a man who would be likely to kill himself with overwork .
" from what jarvey has told us of mr. watson i am inclined to think the superintendent is a <unk> sort of fellow , " remarked <name> , when he and <name> were left alone .
" and , being that kind of man , he probably ca n't stand for a fellow who wants to loaf around and drink and smoke . "
" i guess you 've sized it up about right , <name> , " answered the senator's son .
" in these days the <unk> seems to be 'keep moving ' ; and a fellow has got to 'get there ' if he wants to hold down his job . "
at last the train rolled into the city of san <name> .
before this place was reached <name> jarvey had met a number of other men who had boarded the train at a station some miles away ; and he was so interested in what the newcomers had to tell him that he seemed to forget completely the presence of <name> and <name> .
" and i 'd just as lief he would forget us , " said our hero to his chum .
" i 'd rather go to mr. watson alone than have that man introduce us . "
" exactly the way i feel about it , " returned the senator 's son .
" come on , let 's see if we ca n't slip away from him through the crowd . "
this they did easily , and soon found themselves walking along one of the quaint streets of san <name> bound for the building in which the mentor construction company had its temporary offices .
contrary to what <name> jarvey had told them , they found mr. <name> watson a very pleasant man with whom to deal .
there was little of nonsense about him , and he lost no time in finding out who the youths were and for what they had come .
but his manner was courteous , and he made both <name> and <name> feel thoroughly at home .
" i know mr. ramsdell very well .
he 's a fine fellow , " said the superintendent of the construction company .
" i had a personal letter from him in regard to you , and i 'm going to put you out under one of the best men we have down here in texas , mr. <name> obray , who is now working on the construction of the new <unk> bridge to the west of this place .
he is expecting some new helpers , and he asked me to send him the two best fellows i could find , so i am going to send you , " and mr. watson smiled slightly .
" thank you very much , mr. watson , " answered <name> .
" oh , you do n't have to thank me , <name> , " returned the superintendent , quickly .
" you just go out and make good .
that is all this company asks of any one it employs . "
" when do you want us to start , mr .
watson ? "
questioned <name> .
" you can suit yourselves about that , although the sooner you report to mr. obray the better i think he 'll be pleased . "
the superintendent walked to a back door of his office and called to some one without .
" i 'll turn you over to one of our clerks and he <name> give you all the details regarding your positions , " he explained .
the clerk proved to be a young man only a few years older than <name> and <name> , and the youths took to him at once .
he explained in detail where they were to go and what the construction camp located near the new <unk> bridge consisted of , and also told them what their work would probably be for the first few months .
" of course , you 've got to start at the bottom of the ladder , " he explained .
" but you 'll find mr. obray a splendid man to be under , and you 'll probably learn more under him than you would under any of our other head engineers . "
" in that case i 'm mighty glad mr. watson assigned us to mr. <unk> gang , " answered <name> .
it was arranged that <name> and his chum should start westward early the following morning .
this would give them a part of an afternoon and an evening in san <name> in which to look around and take in the sights of that quaint town .
during the conversation with mr. watson and the clerk , <name> had been rather surprised because <name> jarvey had not shown himself , because on the train he had said he was <unk> ; and they had naturally supposed he would come to the offices without delay .
just as they were preparing to leave they heard an angry discussion going on in mr. watson 's private office , and they heard the voices of the superintendent and the man they had met on the train .
" i gave you strict orders to come right back , jarvey , " they heard mr. watson say .
" you knew we were waiting for those <unk> . "
" i was delayed , " growled <name> jarvey in return .
" you see , there were some things about the prints  " " i do n't want any excuses , " broke in mr. watson .
" the <unk> were all right and were waiting for you .
you took a day off simply to go and have a good time .
now i want to warn you for the last time .
if such a thing happens again i 'll discharge you . "
chapter xxiii at the engineering camp " i can understand now why that man jarvey spoke against mr. watson , " remarked <name> , as he and his chum walked along the main street of san <name> .
" mr. watson evidently has no use for a fellow who doesn't attend to business . "
" i think he 's all right , <name> , " returned <name> .
" of course , he's business clean through .
but that is what you 've got to expect from a man who holds such a position . "
" exactly , <name> .
the fellow who takes his own time and does things about as he pleases has no place in the modern business world . "
the two youths had received full instructions regarding what they were to do .
they were to take a train westward early in the morning for a small place known as <unk> , situated but a short distance from the rio grande .
there they were to report to mr. <name> obray .
mr. watson had asked them regarding what they had brought along in the way of baggage , and on being questioned had advised them to purchase several other things before starting for the engineering camp .
" this is certainly an odd sort of place  quite different from a new england town , " was <name> 's comment , as he and his chum went from one shop to another in san <name> in quest of the things they wished to buy .
" seems to me that it has quite a mexican flavor to it , " remarked <name> .
" just see all the big hats and the fringed trousers . "
now that they had come so far the chums were eager to get to the camp , and they could scarcely wait until the following morning .
they found a comfortable hotel , had an early breakfast , and by seven o'clock were on their way westward .
" now we are almost on the border , " remarked <name> , as they stopped at a place called <name> rio .
he was studying a railroad map .
" at the next place , called <unk> , we <name> be on the rio grande , with mexico just across from us . "
" it is n't such a very grand river after all , " remarked <name> , when they came in sight of the stream .
" it looks more like a great big overgrown creek to me . "
" you ca n't compare these rivers with the hudson or the st. <name> , <name> .
but i suppose at certain seasons of the year this river gets to be pretty big . "
soon their train rolled into <unk> and the youths alighted .
the station was a primitive affair , consisting of a small platform and a building not over ten feet square .
word had been sent ahead that they were coming , and among the several texans and mexicans who had gathered to watch the train come in , they found a middle-aged man on a <unk> with two other <unk> standing behind .
" are you the young fellows for the mentor camp ? "
he questioned , as <name> and <name> approached him .
" we are , " returned our hero , quickly .
" did you come for us ? "
" i did .
mr. watson sent a wire that you were coming , so the boss sent me here to get you , thinking you would n't know the way .
<name> and morr , i believe  but which is which ? "
" i am <name> <name> , " answered <name> , " and this is my chum , <name> morr . "
" glad to know you .
my name is <name> andrews .
i am from <unk> , pennsylvania .
i suppose you can ride ? "
" oh , yes , " answered <name> .
" we did more or less riding when we were out on <name> ranch . "
" good enough !
some of the young fellows who come out here ca n't ride at all , and they have some trouble getting around , believe me !
this , you know , is the country of magnificent distances , " and <name> andrews laughed .
" how many have you in the camp here ? "
questioned <name> , after he and <name> had mounted the two waiting <unk> and were riding off beside the man from the engineering camp .
" there are twenty of us in the engineering gang , and i think they have about seventy to eighty men in the construction camp , with forty or fifty more on the way .
you see , they have been bothered a great deal for hired help lately on account of the trouble with the mexican bandits and revolutionists .
lots of men are afraid to come down here to work for fear some bandits <name> make a raid across the border and shoot them down . "
" have you had any trouble lately ? "
questioned <name> , quickly .
" we had trouble about two weeks ago .
a couple of dirty mexicans came into camp and were caught trying to steal away that night with some of our belongings .
one of the fellows got a crack on the head with a club , and the other we think was shot in the side .
but both of them got away in the darkness . "
" that 's interesting , to say the least , " remarked <name> , drily .
" i guess we 've got to sleep with our eyes open , as the saying is . "
" you 've certainly got to watch yourself while you 're down here , " answered <name> andrews .
" there is more talk about trouble than anything else , but the talk gets on some of the men 's nerves , and we have had one civil engineer and two helpers leave us just on that account .
they said they would prefer to work somewhere in the united states where they would n't be worried thinking the greasers might attack them . "
as the party rode along they had to cross a bridge which was comparatively new , and their guide explained that this structure was one erected by the mentor company .
then they went over a slight rise , and finally came into view of a long row of <unk> buildings with several rows of <unk> houses behind them .
" here we are at the camp ! "
announced the guide .
" the engineering gang lives and does business in these houses here , and those huts at the back are used by the construction gangs . "
[ illustration : " here we are at the camp ! "
announced the <unk>  <name> <unk> ] it was all so new and novel to <name> and <name> that they were intensely interested .
with their guide they rode up to the main building and dismounted .
in a moment more they found themselves inside and confronted by mr. <name> obray , the head of the camp .
" glad to see you , " he said , shaking hands after they had introduced themselves .
" we are rather short of helpers just now ; so you 'll find plenty to do .
i understand mr. ramsdell has given you a first-class recommendation .
i <name> that you 'll be able to live up to it , " and he smiled faintly .
" i 'm going to do what i can , mr. obray , " answered <name> .
" and so am i , " added <name> .
<name> andrews had already told them that a man with a wagon would be sent down to the station for their trunks and suitcases , all of which had been left in charge of the station-master .
the youths were taken to one of the buildings not far from the office , and there assigned to a room containing two cots .
" of course , this is n't the <unk> hotel or the <unk> <unk> , " remarked <name> andrews , with a grin .
" if you stay out here you 'll have to learn to rough it . "
" we know something about roughing it already , " answered <name> .
" if the other fellows can stand it i guess we can . "
" you wo n't find it so bad when you get used to it , " answered the man .
" of course , it 's pretty hot during the day , but the nights are quite comfortable .
we 've got a first-class colored cook , so you wo n't find yourselves cut short on meals . "
" that 's good news , " answered the senator 's son .
" i always thought that a good meal covered a multitude of sins , " and at this <unk> <name> andrews laughed heartily .
the man had already been despatched to get the baggage , and after it arrived <name> and <name> proceeded to make themselves at home , each donning such clothing as they saw the others of the engineering corps wearing .
" it 's good-bye to boiled shirts and stiff collars , " said <name> , " and i 'm not sorry for it . "
" nor am i , " returned <name> .
" i 'll feel much more like working in this comfortable outfit . "
almost before they knew it , it was noon , and presently they saw a number of men , some of them quite young , coming in to dinner .
through <name> andrews they were introduced to all the others , and then placed at one of the tables in the mess hall where a helper of <name> , the cook , served them with a meal which , if not exactly elegant , was certainly <unk> and substantial .
" i want you two young men to stay around the offices for the rest of this week , " announced mr. obray to them after the meal .
" that <name> give you a chance to <unk> yourselves with what we are doing in the way of constructions in this vicinity .
then next week you can go out with the gang and begin your regular field practice . "
the youths soon found that practical work in the office was quite different from the theoretical work done under mr. ramsdell .
still their tutor had instructed them faithfully , so that they soon " caught on , " as <name> remarked .
when they did not understand a thing they did not hesitate to ask questions , and they found the other persons present very willing to explain and to help them .
there was a spirit of comradeship throughout the whole camp that was as comforting as it was beneficial .
" it is n't everybody for himself here , " explained <name> andrews .
" it is one for all .
you are expected to do all you can for the other fellow , and in return it 's understood that he <name> do all he can for you . "
" it 's a fine method , " answered <name> ; " and i do n't wonder that the mentor construction company is making such a success of its undertakings . "
one day our hero asked <name> andrews if he knew <name> jarvey .
at the question the man <name> down the corners of his mouth and shook his head in disgust .
" yes , i know <name> , " he answered .
" he 's over in the offices at san <name> mostly , but he occasionally comes out here on business for mr. watson .
i must say i do n't like him very much , and i do n't think the other men do either .
he 's a fellow who likes to drink now and then , and i understand he often <unk> .
that is , when he has the money .
he 's usually strapped long before pay-day comes around . "
" i thought he might be that sort of fellow , " answered <name> .
" he got into a row with mr. watson while we were at san <name> , " put in <name> , and related a few of the particulars .
" if <name> does n't look out he 'll lose his job , and it <name> be too bad , " answered <name> andrews , " because he wo n't be likely to get another such easy berth in a hurry .
he gets good money for what little he does .
he hired with the company as a first-class bookkeeper , but i understand he is only ordinary when it comes to handling big masses of figures . "
" well , i did n't like him when i met him , and i 'd be just as well satisfied if we did n't meet again , " said <name> .
but <name> 's wish was not to be gratified .
he was to meet <name> jarvey in the future , and that meeting was to bring with it a great surprise .
chapter xxiv a midnight alarm " well , <name> , we have been in this camp just a month to-day .
how do you think you like it ? "
" i like it first-rate , <name>  in fact , better than i first thought i would .
all the engineers and assistants are so kind and helpful . "
" that 's what they are , " returned the senator 's son .
" and i think we are getting along <unk> .
do you know , i am actually in love with the construction of this new <unk> bridge .
i think it 's going to be a dandy when it 's completed . "
" not only a dandy , <name> , but , unless i miss my guess , it <name> be a monument to the skill and ingenuity of the mentor construction company .
i 've been reading up on all kinds of bridges , and i think the construction of this particular bridge goes ahead of most of them . "
" one thing is sure  mr. obray is very proud of the way things are going .
i heard from andrews that some of the other construction companies thought we would never be able to build this bridge the way it is going up . "
the talk between the two chums was held in the evening after work for the day had come to an end .
<name> and <name> stood on an elevation of ground surveying the unfinished bridge  or rather chain of bridges  which spanned a river and the <unk> beyond .
it had been a great engineering feat to obtain the proper foundations for the bridge where it spanned the <unk> , and make them impervious to the floods which came with great force during certain seasons of the year .
the first week at the camp had been spent in the offices , but all the other time had been put in with the engineering gang that was superintending the construction of the far end of the bridge , and also the laying out of the railroad route through the hills and cuts beyond .
the work had proved fascinating to the chums , and they were surprised to see how quickly the time passed .
<name> and <name> had made a number of friends , but none more agreeable than <name> andrews .
andrews occupied a room close to their own , and often spent an evening with them .
about the end of the second week they had received word concerning <name> jarvey .
the bookkeeper in the offices at san <name> had had a violent quarrel with mr. watson and had been discharged .
he had gone off declaring that his being treated thus was unjustifiable , and that he was going to bring the mentor construction company to account for it .
" i guess he 's nothing but a bag of wind , " was <name> 's comment , on hearing this .
" the company is probably much better off to have such a chap among the missing . "
" i do n't see what he can do to hurt the company , " had been dave's answer .
" he was probably discharged for good cause . "
although so far away from home , it must not be supposed that <name> and <name> had forgotten the folks left behind .
they had sent numerous letters telling of their various experiences and of what they hoped to do in the future .
in return <name> had received one letter from his father and another from his mother , and <name> had gotten communications from his sister <name> and from <name> , and also a long letter from <name> .
of these the letter received from <name> was to our hero the most important , and it must be confessed that he read it a number of times .
the girl was greatly interested in all that he had told her about his work , and she said she hoped he would become a great civil engineer , and that she certainly trusted he would not have any trouble with the mexicans .
the letter from <name> basswood had been rather a disheartening communication .
<name> wrote that his father did not seem to regain his health as rapidly as the doctor had anticipated , and that nothing new concerning <name> porton or <name> crapsey had been uncovered .
<name> added that he had written to the authorities in new york city concerning porton and had received word back that they had been unable to locate the former moving-picture actor .
" i believe the loss of those miniatures has had its full effect on mr. basswood , " remarked <name> , when speaking of the matter to his chum .
" i suppose it makes him feel blue , and that <unk> his recovery . "
" more than likely , " answered <name> .
" a person ca n't very well throw off a heavy spell of sickness when he is so depressed in spirits .
it's too bad !
and i suppose mrs. basswood feels dreadful to think she was the one to let the fortune slip out of their hands . "
" no doubt of it , <name> .
of course , it 's easy enough to blame her , and i suppose a great many of their neighbors do .
but , just the same , place yourself in her position  worried half to death over the sickness of her husband  and you might have done the same thing . "
it was a warm evening and the chums took their time in returning to the camp , knowing supper would not be served until a little later .
during the day several shots had been heard at a great distance to the southward , and some of the civil engineers had wondered if some sort of a scrimmage was taking place on the other side of the rio grande .
" if a fight is in progress i <name> it does n't extend to this neighborhood , " remarked one of the engineers , in speaking of the matter .
" we 've got troubles enough of our own  getting this bridge right  without having the greasers interfering with our work ; " and he gave a grim laugh .
when the chums arrived in camp they found that the day 's mail had come in .
there was a washington newspaper for <name> containing an address delivered in the senate by senator morr , and also a long letter for our hero from <name> .
" well , here is news at last ! "
cried <name> , as he scanned the communication .
" come on out here , away from the crowd , <name> , and i'll read it to you ; " and then he led the way to a corner and acquainted his chum with the contents of the letter , which was as follows : " i know you <name> be interested to learn that we have at last heard from that rascal , <name> crapsey , who , with <name> porton , got the miniatures from my mother .
crapsey sent a very badly written letter to my father , stating that he and porton had parted company , but that he had the most of the miniatures ,  in fact , all but six of them .
" crapsey wrote that he was in the city of new york , and had the miniatures in a safe place , and that he would return them to us for fifteen thousand dollars .
we were to insert a personal advertisement in one of the new york newspapers if we were willing to accept his offer , and then he would send us word how the exchange of money for the miniatures could be made .
" of course , as you know , my father is still sick .
he did n't have anything like fifteen thousand dollars in cash to offer crapsey , and besides that mr. wadsworth and your uncle dunston thought it was altogether too much money to offer a thief like that .
in fact , your uncle was of the opinion that they should only try to lead crapsey on , so that they could capture him .
but my father , backed up by mr. wadsworth , at length agreed to put up five thousand dollars in order to get the miniatures back , and an advertisement was inserted in the newspapers to that effect .
" we waited two days for a reply , and then came a scrawl on a bit of paper signed by crapsey , stating that he was having trouble of another kind and could not for the present keep on with his negotiations .
after that my father inserted another advertisement asking for more information , but up to the present time no additional word has come in .
" my father does not know what to make of it .
your folks and mr. wadsworth are of the opinion that either crapsey was trying to fool them and got scared or else that the rascal has been caught by the police for some other crime and is trying to conceal his identity .
they are divided on the question as to whether to believe crapsey when he wrote that he and porton had parted company  they are half inclined to believe that porton is still with him , and that the whole scheme was framed up by porton . "
" that is certainly interesting news , " remarked <name> , after both had perused the letter a second time .
" and it settles one thing  and that is that <name> crapsey must have been in new york with <name> porton at the time we saw the latter . "
" exactly , <name> .
and it also proves beyond a doubt that that pair were really the thieves .
previous to this we only supposed such to be the fact  we really could n't prove it . "
" oh , i was sure of it all along , <name> . "
" so was i , <name> .
but you know in a court of law it is one thing to know a thing and another to be able to prove it . "
the two young civil engineers discussed the letter all through the evening meal and even for some time later .
then , however , <name> turned to his newspaper , to read with care the address that his father had delivered .
<name> was also interested in this .
" i 'd like to be in the senate some time when your father was speaking , " he remarked to his chum .
" it must be a great sight to see such a body as that when it is in session . "
" it is , <name> , " answered his chum .
" and people come thousands of miles to see it . "
before retiring for the night <name> penned a letter to <name> , and also sent a letter to <name> , and another to his uncle dunston which was meant for the entire household .
<name> spent the time in a communication to his mother , and also in a long letter to <name> watson .
the night proved to be unusually warm , for the breeze which was usually stirring had died down completely .
<name> fell into a fitful doze , from which he awoke about midnight to find his mouth and throat quite parched .
" i guess i 'd better get up and get a drink , " he told himself , " and then i may be able to sleep better .
phew !
but the thermometer has certainly been going up the last few days . "
he arose to his feet and walked out of the room into the hallway of the building , where in one corner there was a <unk> .
he had just finished drinking a glass of water when a sound from outside reached his ears .
there was a shout from a distance , followed almost instantly by a rifle shot .
" hello !
what can that mean ? "
he cried .
a moment later came more shouts , this time a little closer to the camp .
then two more rifle shots rang out sharply through the midnight air .
" something is wrong , that 's sure ! "
exclaimed the youth .
rushing back into the bedroom he shook <name> vigorously .
at the same time he heard others getting up and calling to each other , wanting to know what the shouts and shots meant .
" what do you want , <name> ? "
asked the senator 's son , sleepily .
" get up , <name> ! "
answered our hero , quickly .
" hurry up !
there is something going on outside !
i just heard a number of yells and several rifle shots . "
" you do n't mean it , <name> ! "
and now <name> was on his feet with a bound .
" maybe it 's the greasers . "
" i do n't know what it is , <name> .
but i guess we had better slip into our clothing .
maybe somebody is  listen ! "
<name> broke off short , and both strained their ears to hear what was taking place outside .
they heard a confused shouting , followed by several yells .
and then came a volley of shots  five or six in number .
" it 's an attack !
that 's what it is ! "
cried the senator 's son .
" i'll bet some of those mexican bandits are coming over here !
oh , <name> !
what do you suppose we had better do ? "
" i do n't know , except that we had better slip on our clothing and get our pistols , " answered <name> .
" this looks as if it might be serious . "
" up , boys !
up ! "
came the cry from somebody outside .
" get your guns and your pistols !
the mexican raiders are coming this way ! "
chapter xxv the mexican raiders by the time the two chums had hastily donned their clothing and possessed themselves of the pistols they had purchased in san <name> on the advice of mr. watson , the camp was in confusion from end to end , with the various bosses shouting orders and the men themselves wanting to know what the trouble was and what they had better do .
" it 's some of those confounded greasers ! "
cried <name> andrews , as he , too , arose and armed himself .
he had a repeating rifle , and it was known to <name> and <name> that he was an exceptionally good shot .
andrews led the way from the building , followed by our hero and <name> and several others .
in the meantime , the distant shouting and shooting seemed to have moved farther westward , in the direction where the new <unk> bridge was being constructed .
" it ca n't be their intention to blow up the bridge ? "
queried <name> .
there had been talk of this several times .
" no telling what those rascals are up to , " answered <name> andrews .
" this may be only a <unk> kicked up to cover a cattle raid or something like that . "
in the midst of the excitement the telephone in the main office began to ring and was answered by one of the clerks .
a few minutes later he came rushing out to where mr. obray stood talking to his assistant and the boss of the construction camp .
" just got a telephone from the tolman ranch , " announced the clerk .
" old man tolman said they had been <unk> and that half of the raiders were coming this way .
i tried to get some details from him , but in the midst of the talk i was shut off .
i suppose somebody cut the wire . "
" i thought that might be it , " answered the head of the engineering corps .
" we ought to help tolman all we can , " announced the boss of the construction camp .
" he promised to assist us in case we had any trouble , and turn about is fair play . "
" right you are , peterson , and any man who wants to go out can do it . "
and word was passed around to this effect .
<name> and <name> listened to this talk and what followed with much interest .
in less than five minutes over thirty men from the construction camp had signified their willingness to go after the raiders , and these men were joined by <name> andrews and three other civil engineers , all well armed and mounted .
" i 'd like to join that crowd and go after those mexicans ! "
exclaimed <name> , his eyes sparkling .
" so would i ! "
returned the senator 's son , quickly .
" those fellows ca n't be anything but plain bandits and cattle thieves . "
" sure !
no regular revolutionists would come over the border and act in this fashion . "
" what do you say , <name>  shall we go ? "
" i 'm willing . "
" no , no !
you young fellows had better stay in the camp , " announced <name> obray , who overheard the talk .
" just remember that in a certain sense i am responsible for your safety while you are under me . "
" but those others are going , " returned <name> , somewhat reproachfully .
" so they are , <name> .
but they are all older than you , and most of them have had experience in this sort of thing .
i would rather that you stayed here .
maybe if those raiders come this way we 'll have our hands full defending the camp . "
<name> and <name> realized that for the head of the camp to express his <name> in this instance was equal practically to a command ; so they at once gave up the idea of following <name> andrews and the others .
the men rode off quickly , and were soon lost to sight in the darkness of the night .
an hour of intense anxiety passed .
during that time those left in the camp heard an occasional shot in the distance .
then several shots seemed much closer .
there followed some yelling , and , then about five minutes later , came a dull explosion .
" that 's at the bridge ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" they must be trying to blow it up ! "
the dull explosion was followed by a sudden rattle of rifle and pistol shots and more yelling .
once or twice some men seemed to come quite near to the construction camp , the hoof strokes of the horses being distinctly heard .
all who remained in the camp were on the lookout , and each man stood ready with his weapon to do what he could to defend the place should the occasion arise .
but with the explosion and the rattle of rifle and pistol shots that followed , the conflict seemed to die down , and presently all became utter silence ; and thus two more hours passed .
" whoever they were , they seem to have left this vicinity entirely , " said <name> .
" i wish it was morning , " put in another of the young men present .
the watching was beginning to get on his nerves .
at last , just as the first streaks of <name> were beginning to show in the eastern sky , a number of horsemen were descried approaching from the southward .
all in the camp were instantly on their guard , but it was soon seen that it was their friends who were coming back .
they came in somewhat of a horseshoe formation , driving in their midst four prisoners , one of them with his arm done up in a sling and another with his head bandaged .
" they 've got somebody ! "
exclaimed <name> , as the crowd came closer , " four greasers ! "
" three of them look like mexicans , but the other fellow looks like an american , " returned <name> , as the party came to a halt in front of the camp buildings .
those who had come in were at once surrounded by the others , who wanted to know the particulars of what had taken place .
" it was a band of about thirty greasers , and with them were two or three americans , " announced <name> andrews .
" they went down to old man tolman 's corral and tried to drive off about two hundred head of cattle .
they got away from the ranch , and then part of the gang came over this way in the vicinity of the new bridge .
we had two running fights with them , and then they let the cattle go and started for the rio grande .
but before they went one of the rascals set off a bomb near the end of the bridge and blew up a corner of the foundation . "
" why in the world did they want to blow up the bridge ? "
demanded mr. obray .
" they were n't all mexicans , mr. obray .
several of them were americans .
we 've got one of the americans right here .
and do you know who it is ?
<name> <unk> ! "
" what 's that ! "
exclaimed the head of the camp , and then he turned to the prisoners .
one man had his <unk> pulled well down over his forehead , as if somewhat ashamed of himself .
" there he is , " went on <name> andrews , pointing to this individual .
" that 's <name> <unk> , who was discharged for drinking and gambling about two months ago . "
mr. obray strode up to the prisoner and gave him a tap under the <name> , thus elevating his face .
" you 're a fine specimen of humanity , <unk> ! "
he cried sternly .
" a fine business for you to be in  joining mexican outlaws and becoming a cattle <unk> .
what have you to say for yourself ? "
" i have n't anything to say , " grumbled the prisoner .
" what 's the use ?
i was caught with the goods , was n't i ? "
he sneered .
" i 'm ashamed to think an american would go in with a bunch of mexican bandits , " said mr. obray ; and then gave directions that the prisoners should be well bound so that there would be no possibility of their escaping .
all listened with interest to the details of the cattle raid so far as the men who had gone out from the construction camp could relate .
they said that some of the fighting had been exceedingly hot , and they were satisfied that a number of the mexicans , and also one of the americans with them , had been wounded .
they themselves had not escaped unscathed , one man being hit in the shoulder and another in the leg .
fortunately , however , neither of these wounds proved serious .
the camp doctor was called in to attend them , after which he attended the wounded prisoners .
in the meantime , a message was sent to the railroad station and to san <name> , to acquaint the authorities with what had occurred .
" i was questioning <unk> on the way here , " said <name> andrews to the head of the camp .
" he would n't admit it outright , but i am strongly of the opinion that one of the other americans who was with him was <name> jarvey . "
" jarvey ! "
muttered mr. obray .
" well , it would be just like him to join a fellow like <unk> .
they were quite <unk> when they both worked for the company . "
" i 've got another idea about this affair , " went on andrews .
" do you remember how they said jarvey vowed he would get square with the company for discharging him ?
i 've got an idea that it was his scheme to attempt to blow up the bridge , and that he was the one who set off that bomb .
their idea was to get the cattle to some safe place first , and then ruin the bridge .
more than likely jarvey and <unk> made a deal with the greasers to that effect  the americans to help with the cattle and the mexicans to help destroy our work . "
" you may be right , andrews , " answered <name> obray .
" and if you are , it 's a pity that you did n't catch jarvey . "
<name> and <name> listened to this talk with interest , and also joined in the general discussion of those in the camp regarding the raid , and what would be done with the prisoners .
" i suppose they <name> turn the prisoners over to the united states authorities , " was <name> 's opinion ; and in this he was right .
some government officers appeared by noon of the next day , and after a lengthy talk with the head of the camp and a number of others , the prisoners , including <name> <unk> , were taken away .
" i wonder if old man tolman got his cattle back , " remarked <name> .
" all but three of the animals , " answered one of the men present .
" those were trampled to death during the raid .
but three are nothing alongside of two hundred . "
the raid had caused so much excitement in the camp that there was but little work done that day .
the boys went down with the others to inspect the bridge , and look curiously at the hole which had been torn in the corner of one of the foundations by the bomb .
" that was certainly a mean piece of business , " was our hero 's comment .
" it did n't do anybody a bit of good , and it 's going to make a good deal of work to repair the damage . "
several days passed , and the camp at last settled back into its usual routine .
<name> and <name> worked as hard as ever , and both were much pleased when mr. obray told them that they were doing very well .
" i am going to write a letter to mr. ramsdell , " said the head of the camp , " and tell him that i am well satisfied with his pupils , " and he smiled faintly .
a day or two later word came to the camp which interested the chums as much as it did anybody .
it seemed that <name> <unk> had been subjected to a " third degree " of questioning .
he had broken down completely and confessed that the two other americans in the raid with him had been former employees of the mentor construction company  one a fellow named packard brown , and the other <name> jarvey .
<unk> had also let fall the information that jarvey had once been an officer in the united states army , and that he was traveling under an assumed name .
" a former officer of our army and acting in that way ! "
exclaimed <name> , when he heard this report .
" i certainly do <name> they 'll catch him and punish him as he deserves ! "
" my sentiments exactly ! "
added <name> .
chapter xxvi the <name> on the bridge " my , <name> !
but it 's hot ! "
" i agree with you , <name> .
this is the hottest day we 've struck yet .
and such a hard day as it 's been too ! "
and our hero paused to wipe the perspiration from his brow .
" what do you say if we take a swim this evening ? "
went on the senator 's son .
" a plunge into the river would feel good to me . "
" i 'm with you , <name> .
let us eat a light supper and get down to the river before it grows too dark . "
four weeks had passed since the events narrated in the last chapter , and matters in and around the construction camp had once more quieted down .
work was being pushed forward rapidly , and <name> and <name> were making excellent progress in their chosen profession .
they had made a warm personal friend of <name> andrews , as well as a friend of mr. obray , and both of these individuals gave them many instructions during off hours which proved highly beneficial .
no more had been heard from the mexican raiders , and it was hoped that those bandits had departed for some other locality along the rio grande .
the prisoners taken during the raid were still in jail , awaiting trial .
down along the stream over which the new <unk> bridge was being constructed there was a favorite swimming place used by the civil engineers and their assistants , the men and boys of the construction gang using another spot farther down the stream .
" i 'll beat you getting in , <name> ! "
cried <name> , as the pair neared the bathing place that evening , and he started to take off some of his clothes .
" do n't jump in too quickly , <name> , " warned our hero .
" remember you have just been eating and you are rather warm .
better take it easy on the bank for a little while . "
" i guess you 're right , " was the reply .
" i do n't want to get a cramp or a chill , or anything like that . "
to reach the swimming spot , the chums had to pass one end of the new bridge .
as they <name> closer they saw somebody high up on the skeleton structure gazing at them curiously .
" hello !
who 's that up there ? "
remarked <name> .
" i 'm sure i do n't know , " answered <name> .
" i thought all our men were back in camp . "
as they came still closer the individual on the bridge turned to walk toward them .
suddenly , however , he stopped short and tried his best to hide himself behind some of the steel work .
" say !
that looks rather queer to me , " remarked <name> .
" he acts just as if he did n't want us to see him . "
" just what i thought , <name> . "
the senator 's son gave a sudden start .
" you do n't suppose it 's one of those mexican raiders , do you ? "
" i ca n't say anything about that .
i 'm going up there to find out who he is .
it seems to me he is acting very suspiciously .
maybe he's trying to plant some more bombs . "
<name> turned back to a point where he could get up on the bridge , and his chum followed .
from this point they could not see the person above them nor could he see them .
when they reached the flooring of the big bridge they were less than two hundred feet from where the unknown person stood .
he was leaning over the side of the structure , evidently trying to find out what had become of them .
" why , <name> , he  he  looks like you ! "
burst out the senator 's son , as both hurried in the direction of the unknown person .
" i do believe it 's <name> porton ! "
ejaculated our hero .
he began to <unk> his pace .
" yes , i 'm almost sure it 's porton , " he added , a few seconds later .
" if it 's porton what in the world tempted him to follow you to this place ? "
queried <name> .
" i do n't know .
but i do know that i 'm going to capture him if it is possible to do so , " answered <name> , with determination .
the two chums were still almost a hundred feet from the other person when the latter glanced up suddenly and discovered them .
he looked them full in the face for just an instant , and then turned and began to run away towards the opposite end of the long bridge .
" it 's porton , sure enough ! "
burst out <name> .
" hi there , porton !
stop ! "
cried <name> .
" stop , i tell you ! "
" you go on back ! "
yelled <name> porton , in an ugly voice .
" go on back , i tell you !
if you do n't it <name> be the worse for you ! "
and he shook his fist at the chums .
" you might as well stop , " continued <name> , undaunted by the threat .
" you ca n't get away from us .
if you try to jump off the unfinished end of the bridge you 'll break your neck . "
" if you fellows do n't go back i 'll shoot , " returned the fellow who resembled <name> .
" stop right where you are !
do n't dare to come a step closer ! "
" oh , <name> !
do you suppose he is armed ? "
questioned <name> , hastily and in a low tone .
" maybe he is .
but i am going to keep on after him until he shows his pistol , " was the rapid reply .
" you need not come if you do n't want to .
i 'm going to capture him and make him give up the basswood fortune . "
" if you are going after him , so am i , " returned the senator 's son , sturdily .
" maybe it was only a bluff about shooting after all . "
while running along the bridge <name> 's eyes fell on a short steel bar left there by one of the workmen .
he stopped just long enough to pick the bar up , and then went after porton with all the speed at his command .
it was a perilous <name> , for in many places the flooring of the big bridge was still missing and they had to leap from girder to girder of the steel structure .
" stop , i tell you ! "
yelled <name> porton once more , when <name> was within ten yards of him .
and then he turned squarely around and our hero and <name> saw the glint of a pistol as the rascal pointed it toward them .
" he is armed ! "
cried <name> , and now there was a note of fear in his voice , and not without reason .
" get behind the steel work , " ordered <name> , and lost no time in dodging partly out of sight .
as he moved , however , he launched forth the steel bar he had picked up .
more by good luck than anything else the bar sped true to its <name> .
it struck <name> porton in the forearm , the hand of which was holding the pistol .
in another instant the weapon was clattering down through the steel work of the bridge to the river far below .
" hurrah , <name> !
you 've disarmed him ! "
cried <name> .
for the instant <name> porton seemed dazed by the sudden turn of affairs .
evidently , however , the blow from the steel bar had not hurt him much , for , turning quickly , he continued his flight along the bridge .
<name> and <name> lost no time in following him .
it was not long before the fugitive and those behind him reached a section of the long bridge which was far from completed .
here there was practically no flooring , and <name> porton had to jump from one piece of steel work to another , while <name> and <name> , of course , had to do the same .
once those in the rear saw the rascal ahead make a <unk> and plunge downward .
but he saved himself , and , scrambling to his feet , dashed forward as madly as before .
" take care , <name> , it 's dangerous here , " gasped <name> ; and scarcely had he spoken when he himself made a <unk> and shot down below the level of the bridge flooring .
<name> was several feet in advance , but turned instantly when his chum let out a cry of alarm .
he saw <name> four or five feet below him , clinging frantically to one of the stays of the bridge .
" <unk>  help m  me ! "
panted the unfortunate youth .
" hold tight , <name> .
i 'll help you , " returned <name> , quickly .
[ illustration : " hold tight , <name> !
i 'll help you , " returned <name> , <unk>  <name> <unk> ] the stay below was so small in diameter that all <name> could do was to cling to it with both hands and one leg .
in this position he <name> until <name> let himself down several feet and managed to give him a hand .
then with extreme caution both worked their way back to the unfinished flooring of the bridge .
" oh my !
i thought sure i was a goner ! "
panted the senator 's son , when he found himself safe once more .
he had turned white and he was trembling from head to foot .
" i guess you had better not go any farther , <name> , " remarked <name> .
" this certainly is dangerous work . "
" it 's a wonder porton does n't fall , " was the other 's comment , as they both watched the fleeing rascal , who was leaping from girder to girder with a recklessness that was truly amazing .
" he 's scared stiff at the idea of being captured , " was <name> 's comment .
" if it was n't for that , i do n't believe he would take any such chance ; " and in this surmise our hero was probably correct .
<name> hated to give up the <name> , so he continued his way along the bridge , making sure , however , of every step and jump he took .
<name> remained where he was , too shaken up to proceed farther when he knew that each step would prove more hazardous than the last .
at last <name> porton gained a point where one of the foundations of the bridge rested on comparatively solid ground , with the river behind and a wide stretch of <unk> ahead .
here there was a long ladder used by the workmen , and down this the rascal went as fast as his feet could <name> him .
by the time <name> reached the top of the ladder , porton was well on his way over the solid ground .
soon the gathering darkness hid him from view .
knowing that it would be next to useless to attempt to follow the rascal now that he had left the vicinity of the bridge , <name> returned to where he had left <name> .
then the pair started slowly back to the end of the bridge from which they had come .
" i ca n't understand what brought <name> porton here , " remarked <name> , when the chums had once more gained the <unk> .
" do you suppose he knew you were in this vicinity , <name> ? "
" possibly , <name> .
but at the same time , i do n't think that would explain his presence here .
he would n't dare to <unk> me around this camp .
he 'd be sure to be caught at it sooner or later . "
" well , i do n't understand it at all . "
" neither do i. i am sorry that we did n't catch the rascal , " returned <name> , soberly .
when they went back into camp they informed <name> andrews , and also mr. obray , of what had occurred .
these men had already heard some of the particulars regarding <name> 's double and the disappearance of the basswood fortune .
" too bad you did n't get him , " said <name> andrews .
" but you be careful how you run over that unfinished bridge , unless you want to have a nasty fall and either get killed or else crippled for life . "
several days went by , including <name> , and nothing more was seen or heard of <name> porton although the lads made a thorough search for him .
<name> sent letters home and to <name> basswood , telling the folks in crumville of what had happened .
" a little <unk> to see you , <name> , " remarked one of the civil engineers as <name> was coming from an unusually difficult <unk> work .
he walked to where his fellow worker had pointed , and there saw a dirty , unkempt mexican lad standing with a letter in his hand .
the communication was addressed to <name> , and , opening it , he read the following : " i have broken with <name> crapsey and have the basswood miniatures here with me safely in mexico .
if the <unk> <name> pay me ten thousand dollars in cash they can have the pictures back .
otherwise i am going to destroy them .
i <name> give them two weeks in which to make good .
" as you are so close at hand , maybe you can transact the business for mr. basswood .
when you are ready to open negotiations , send a letter to the <unk> camp , across the border , and i <name> get it .
" <name> porton . "
chapter xxvii across the rio grande <name> read the note from <name> porton with intense interest , and then passed it over to <name> .
" what do you know about that ! "
exclaimed the senator 's son , after he had perused the communication .
" do you think porton tells the truth ? "
" i do n't know what to think , <name> .
if he does tell the truth , then it is quite likely that <name> crapsey was trying to play a double game so far as the <unk> were concerned . "
" it 's pretty clever on porton 's part , " said <name> , <unk> .
" he knows it would be very difficult for us to get hold of him while he is in mexico , with this revolution going on .
and at the same time he is close enough to keep in touch with you , knowing that you can easily transact this business for the <unk>  providing , of course , that mr. basswood is willing . "
<name> did not answer to this , for he was looking around for the mexican youth who had delivered the note .
but the boy had slipped away , and a search of the camp failed to reveal what had become of him .
" i guess he was instructed to sneak away without being seen , " was our hero 's comment .
" porton knew that i would n't be in a position to answer him at once , and he did n't want me to follow that boy . "
<name> read the note again , and then went off to consult with <name> andrews and mr. obray .
" it 's too bad you did n't capture that little <unk> , " observed the head of the civil engineers .
" we might have been able to get some information from him .
however , if he 's gone that 's the end of it .
i think the best thing you can do , <name> , is to send a night message to this mr. basswood , telling him how the note was received and repeating it word for word .
then the responsibility for what may follow <name> not rest on your shoulders . "
our hero thought this good advice , and , aided by his chum , he concocted what is familiarly known as a night letter , to be sent by telegraph to crumville .
on the following day came a surprise for our hero in the shape of a short message from <name> basswood which ran as follows : " yours regarding porton received .
crapsey makes another offer .
pair probably enemies now .
<name> write or wire instructions later . "
" this is certainly getting interesting , " remarked <name> , after having read the message .
he turned it over to <name> .
" i guess <name> is right  crapsey and porton have fallen out and each is claiming to have the miniatures . "
" well , one or the other must have them , <name> . "
" perhaps they divided them , <name> .
thieves often do that sort of thing , you know . "
" do you suppose <name> porton is really around that <unk> camp in mexico ? "
went on the senator 's son .
" probably he is hanging out somewhere in that vicinity .
i do n't think he has joined general <unk> .
he thinks too much of his own neck to become a soldier in any revolution . "
having sent his message to the <unk> and received <name> 's reply , there seemed nothing further for our hero to do but to wait .
he and <name> were very busy helping to survey the route beyond the new <unk> bridge , and in the fascination of this occupation <name> porton was , for the next few days , almost forgotten .
" if the <unk> expect you to do anything regarding that note you got from porton they had better get busy before long , " remarked <name> one evening .
" otherwise porton may do as he threatened  destroy the pictures . "
" oh , i do n't believe he 'd do anything of that sort , <name> , " answered <name> .
" what would be the use ?
i think he would prefer to hide them somewhere , thinking that some day he would be able to make money out of them . "
four days after this came a bulky letter from <name> basswood which <name> and his chum read eagerly .
it was as follows : " i write to let you know that <name> crapsey has been caught at last .
he was traced to new york and then to newark , n. j. , where the police found him in a second-rate hotel .
he had been drinking , and confessed that he had had a row with <name> porton and that one night , when he was under the influence of liquor , porton had <unk> , taking all but two of the miniatures with him .
the two miniatures had been sold to a fence in new york city for one hundred dollars , and the police think they can easily get them back .
with the hundred dollars crapsey had evidently gone on a spree , and it was during this that porton sneaked away with the other miniatures .
crapsey had an idea that porton was bound for boston , where he would take a steamer for europe .
but we know he was mistaken .
" the case being as it is , my father , as well as your folks and mr. wadsworth , thinks that porton must have the pictures with him in mexico .
that being the case , your uncle dunston says he <name> come down to texas at once to see you , and i am to come with him .
what <name> be done in the matter i do n't know , although my father would much rather give up ten thousand dollars than have the miniatures destroyed .
if you receive any further word from <name> porton tell him that i am coming down to negotiate with him .
you had better not mention your uncle 's name . "
" looks as if porton told the truth after all , " announced <name> .
" probably he watched his opportunity and the first chance he got he <unk> and left crapsey to take care of himself . "
" most likely , <name> .
i do n't believe there is any honor among thieves . "
<name> had not said how soon he and dunston <name> would arrive .
but as they would probably follow the letter the two chums looked for the pair on almost every train .
but two days passed , and neither put in an appearance .
" they must have been delayed by something , " was <name> 's comment .
" maybe they are trying to get that ten thousand dollars together , " suggested <name> .
" i do n't believe my uncle dunston <name> offer porton any such money right away , " returned our hero .
" he 'll see first if he ca n't work it so as to capture the rascal . "
on the following morning <name> was sent southward on an errand for mr. obray .
when he returned he was very much excited .
" <name> , i think i saw <name> porton again ! "
he exclaimed , as he rushed up to our hero .
" where was that ? "
questioned <name> , quickly .
" down on that road which leads to the rio grande .
there was a fellow talking to a ranchman i 've met several times , a texan named lawson .
as soon as he saw me he took to his heels .
i questioned lawson about him and he said the fellow had come across the river at a point about a quarter of a mile below here . "
<name> listened to this explanation with interest , and immediately sought out mr. obray .
the upshot of the talk was that our hero was given permission to leave the camp for the day , taking <name> with him .
the two chums went off armed with their pistols , not knowing what might happen .
they first walked to where <name> had met the ranchman , and there the senator 's son pointed out the direction that the young man who had run away had taken .
they followed this trail , and presently reached the roadway which ran in sight of the river .
there were comparatively few craft on the stream , and none of these looked as if it might be occupied by the young man they were after .
but presently they reached a small creek flowing into the rio grande , and on this saw two flat-bottomed rowboats .
" there he is now ! "
exclaimed <name> , suddenly , and pointed to the first of the rowboats , which was being sent down the creek in the direction of the river .
the sole occupant of the craft was the fellow at the oars , and the two chums readily made out that it was the former moving-picture actor .
as soon as he made certain of porton 's identity , <name> pulled <name> down in the tall grass which bordered the creek .
" there is no use in letting him see us , " explained our hero .
" do you suppose he is bound for the mexican shore ? "
questioned the senator 's son .
" more than likely , <name> . "
<name> looked questioningly at his chum .
" are you game to follow him ? "
he added .
" what do you mean ? "
" we might take that other rowboat and go after him .
i see it contains a pair of oars .
either of us ought to be able to row as well as porton , and if we can catch him before he lands maybe we 'll be able to drive him back to the united states side of the river . "
" all right , i 'll go with you , " responded <name> , quickly .
" come ahead ! "
and he started on a run for the rowboat .
the craft was tied fast to two stakes , but it was an easy matter for them to loosen the ropes .
this done , <name> took up the oars , shoved off , and started to row with all the strength at his command .
evidently <name> porton had not expected to be followed , for he was rowing leisurely , allowing his flat-bottomed boat to drift with the current .
he was much surprised when he saw the other boat come on at a good rate of speed .
" get back there ! "
he yelled , when he recognized the occupants of the second craft .
" get back , i tell you , or i 'll shoot ! "
" if you do we 'll do some shooting on our own account , porton ! "
called back <name> , and showed his pistol .
the sight of the weapon evidently frightened porton greatly .
yet he did not cease rowing , and now he headed directly for the mexican shore .
the river at this point was broad and shallow and contained numerous <unk> .
almost before they knew it the craft containing our friends ran up on one of the bars and stuck there .
in the meantime <name> porton continued his efforts to gain the shore .
" what 's the matter , <name> ? "
cried <name> , when he saw our hero stop rowing .
" we are aground , " was the answer .
" here , <name> , get to the stern of the boat with me , and we 'll see if we ca n't shove her off again . "
with the two chums in the stern of the craft , the bow came up out of the <unk> , and in a few seconds more <name> , aided by the current of the stream , managed to get the rowboat clear .
but all this had taken time , and now the two chums saw that <name> porton had beached his boat and was running across the <unk> beyond .
" i 'm afraid he is going to get away , " remarked <name> , dolefully .
" not much ! "
answered <name> .
" anyway , i 'm not going to give up yet , " and he resumed his rowing .
" here , let me take a turn at that .
you must be getting a little tired , " said <name> , and he insisted that <name> allow him to do the rowing .
soon they reached the mexican shore , at a point where there was a wide stretch of <unk> with not a building in sight .
they had gotten several glimpses of <name> porton making his way through the tall grass .
the trail was an easy one to follow .
" come on !
we 'll get him yet ! "
muttered <name> , and started off on the run with <name> behind him .
they had just reached an <unk> highway when they heard shouting in the distance .
they saw <name> porton running wildly in the direction of a set of low buildings , evidently belonging to some sort of ranch .
as the former moving-picture actor disappeared , a band of mexican cavalry swept into view .
" quick , <name> !
down in the grass ! "
cried <name> .
" we do n't want those soldiers to see us !
they may be government troops , but they look more like <unk>  like the rascals who <unk> the tolman ranch ! "
" right you are , " answered the senator 's son .
and then both lay low in the tall grass while the mexican <unk> , for they were nothing else , swept past them .
chapter xxviii a strange discovery as nearly as <name> and <name> could calculate , there were about two hundred of the mexican <unk>  dirty and <unk> individuals , led by an officer wearing an enormous hat and a long , drooping mustache .
the entire crowd looked disreputable in the extreme , and the youths could not help but shudder as they gazed at the cavalcade .
" my gracious , <name> !
do you call those revolutionists ? "
remarked <name> , after the last of the horsemen had disappeared down the roadway .
" they may be revolutionists , <name> .
but to my mind they look more like bandits than anything else .
under the pretense of aiding mexico they probably steal whenever they get the chance . "
" i 'd hate awfully to fall into their clutches .
i think they 'd <name> a fellow of every dollar he had . "
" well , never mind those mexicans , <name> , " pursued <name> .
" come on , let us see if we ca n't locate <name> porton . "
" he went over into one of yonder buildings . "
" i know it , and i 've got an idea , " answered our hero .
" let us see if we ca n't sneak across the roadway without being seen and then come up to those buildings through the thick grass and behind that <unk> .
if we expose ourselves porton <name> , of course , keep out of our sight or run away . "
with extreme caution the two chums worked their way through the tall grass to the edge of the roadway .
then , watching their chance when nobody seemed to be looking , they dashed to the other side and into the grass again .
then they began to work their way cautiously in the direction of the group of buildings into which the former moving-picture actor had disappeared .
the buildings belonged to a mexican ranch ; but the place had evidently been the scene of a fight at some time in the past , for one of the buildings was completely wrecked and several of the others much battered .
there were no horses , cattle , pigs , or chickens anywhere in sight ; and the youths came to the conclusion that the ranch had been abandoned by its owner .
" probably some of those <unk> came along and cleaned him out , " observed <name> , " and after that he did n't think it would be worth while to stay so long as the country was in a state of war . "
in a few minutes more <name> and his chum gained the first of the buildings .
here they paused to listen and to look around .
" you want to be on your guard , <name> , " whispered our hero .
" porton may be watching us and he may have some of his friends here .
for all we know this may be his <unk> . "
" i 'll be on guard , do n't fear , " answered the senator 's son , and brought forth his pistol .
" do n't use that gun unless you have to , " warned <name> , who did not favor any shooting , even in an extreme case like this .
" i 'll not give a rascal like porton the chance to shoot me first , " retorted <name> .
" that fellow ought to be in jail , and you know it . "
to this our hero did not answer .
he felt in his pocket to make sure that his own weapon was ready for use .
not a sound from the other buildings had reached them , nor did any one appear to be in sight .
" looks to me as if we were in sole possession , now that those <unk> have gone , " announced <name> .
" wow !
i <name> they do n't come back ,  at least not until we are safe on our side of the rio grande , " he added grimly .
" come on , we 'll take a look through the buildings , " answered <name> .
" do n't make any noise if you can possibly help it . "
leaving the building which they had first entered  an abandoned stable  they moved through a broken-down cow-shed to a long , low structure which had evidently been used by the helpers on the ranch .
this building was also deserted , and all that remained in it was some filthy bedding alive with vermin .
" come on , let us get out of here , " remarked <name> , as he looked with <unk> at the <unk> presented .
" how can human beings live like this , <name> ? "
" i do n't know , <name> .
this place ought to be burned down  it 's the only way to get it clean , " <name> added , shaking his head in disgust over the sight .
less than fifty feet away was the corner of the main building of the ranch .
peering out cautiously , to make sure that no one was watching them , the two chums hurried across the open space and crouched down beneath a wide-open window .
then <name> , pistol in hand , looked in through the opening .
the room beyond was deserted , and a glance around showed him that it contained little besides some heavy pieces of furniture which the <unk> had evidently been unable to remove .
on a table rested several empty liquor bottles , and also a number of cigar and cigarette <unk> .
on the floor were scattered newspapers and some playing cards .
" the fellows who were here evidently got out in a hurry , " remarked <name> .
" are you going to go in ? "
questioned <name> .
" i guess so .
what do you think about it ? "
" i 'm with you , <name> .
now we have gone so far , we might as well finish the job . "
it was an easy matter for the two chums to climb through the low window .
once in the room , they advanced toward a doorway leading to an apartment that opened on the <unk> of the ranch home  an open courtyard which had once boasted of a well-kept flower garden , but which was now neglected and overrun with weeds .
as <name> gazed out across the <unk> he saw a movement in a room on the opposite side of the ranch home .
the face of a man had appeared for a few seconds .
behind him was some one else  who , however , <name> could not make out .
" my gracious , <name> ! "
gasped our hero in a low voice .
" did you see that fellow ? "
" i saw some one . "
" it was <name> jarvey ! "
" jarvey !
are you sure ? "
" i am certain of it .
now what do you think of that ! "
" i 'm sure i do n't know what to think , <name> .
maybe he is making his headquarters here , the same as <name> porton . "
" i am going to try to find out .
come on . "
our hero made a quick mental calculation as to the ground plan of the ranch <unk> then he and <name> began to work their way from one room to another , and then through a long , narrow hallway , until they reached the other side of the building .
here they paused at the end of the hallway to listen .
from a room close at hand came a murmur of voices .
by straining his ears <name> made out the tones of <name> jarvey .
the former bookkeeper for the mentor construction company was evidently talking to another man , but what was being said was not distinguishable .
" it 's jarvey all right enough , " whispered <name> .
" yes .
but that is n't <name> porton with him , " returned <name> .
" i know it .
it 's some man . "
both continued to listen , and presently heard <name> jarvey give a sarcastic laugh .
" you 've got another guess coming , packard brown , if you think you are going to get that much out of the deal ! "
he cried .
" remember , you have n't done a thing to help us . "
" that 's all right , <name> jarvey , " retorted the man called packard brown .
" when we left the u. s. a. and came over here it was understood that we were to share and share alike in everything . "
" yes , but i did n't think this new thing was coming up , " growled jarvey .
" we were to share equal on what we happened to get out of the greasers .
this is another thing entirely . "
" i admit that .
just the same , i think i 'm entitled to my share . "
" well , you help us all you can and you 'll get a nice little wad out of it , brown . "
what more was said on this subject did not reach the ears of <name> and <name> , for just then the latter pulled our hero by the sleeve .
" somebody 's coming ! "
he whispered .
" maybe it 's porton . "
<name> did not answer .
at the end of the <unk> hallway there was a closet which in years gone by had been used for the storage of guns and clothing .
into this closet the two youths went , closing the door carefully after them .
" it 's porton all right enough , " whispered <name> , who a moment later was crouching low and looking through a large keyhole devoid of a key .
" there he goes into the room where the two men are . "
" then those two men must be in with him , " returned the senator 's son .
" say , <name> , this is certainly getting interesting ! "
" it 's going to make our job a pretty hard one , " answered our hero .
" if <name> porton was alone we might be able to capture him .
but i don't see how we are going to do it with jarvey and that man named brown present . "
" maybe if we offer jarvey and brown a large reward they <name> help us make porton a prisoner , " suggested <name> .
" more than likely jarvey is on his <unk> and <name> do anything to get a little cash . "
the two youths came out into the <unk> hallway once more , and on <unk> crept toward the door of the room occupied by <name> porton and the two men .
" i went all around the buildings , and looked up and down the roadway , but i could n't see anything of them , " the former moving-picture actor was saying .
" i guess they got cold feet when they saw those soldiers .
say , those greasers certainly were a <unk> bunch ! "
" i do n't believe they were any of general <unk> 's army , " returned <name> jarvey .
" they were probably some detachment out for whatever they could lay their hands on , " and he chuckled coarsely .
evidently he considered that such <unk> warfare under certain circumstances was perfectly justifiable .
following this there was some talk which neither of those outside the door could catch .
then came a rather loud exclamation from <name> porton which startled our friends more than anything else that could have been said .
" well , now , look here , dad ! "
cried the former moving-picture actor .
" you let me run this affair .
i started it , and i know i can put it through successfully . "
" that 's right , jarvey ! "
broke in packard brown .
" let your son go ahead and work this deal out to suit himself .
he seems to have made a success of it so far  getting the best of that fellow crapsey , " and the speaker chuckled .
<name> and <name> looked at each other knowingly .
here indeed was a revelation .
evidently <name> porton was the son of the man they knew as <name> jarvey .
" my gracious !
i remember now ! "
burst out our hero in a low tone .
" when we went to burlington to see that old man , obadiah jones , about <name> do n't you remember that he told us that <name> was the son of a good-for-nothing lieutenant in the army named jarvey porton ?
that man <unk> who was captured declared that jarvey was living under an assumed name and had been an officer in the army .
it must be true , <name> .
this fellow is really jarvey porton , and he is <name> <unk> father ! "
chapter xxix the capture what <name> said concerning the man he had known as <name> jarvey was true .
he was in reality <name> porton 's father , his full name being <name> jarvey porton .
years before , however , on entering the united states army , he had dropped the name <name> and been known only as jarvey porton .
later , on being dismissed from the army for irregularities in his accounts , he had assumed the name of <name> jarvey .
a lively discussion lasting several minutes , and which our hero and <name> failed to catch , followed the discovery of jarvey <unk> identity .
then the listeners heard the former lieutenant say : " brown , i think you had better go outside and watch to make sure that no one is coming to this place . "
" all right , just as you say , " was the other man 's answer .
evidently he understood that this was a hint that jarvey porton wished to speak to his son in private .
as packard brown placed his hand on the door leading to the <unk> hallway <name> and <name> lost no time in tiptoeing their way back to the closet in which they had before hidden .
from this place they saw brown leave the room and walk outside .
then they returned to their position at the door .
" are you sure the cases are in a safe place , <name> ? "
they heard jarvey porton ask anxiously .
" sure of it , dad .
i hid them with great care . "
" are you sure nobody saw you do it ? "
" not a soul . "
" where was the place ? "
" on a high knoll not far from where we have been tying up the boats , " answered <name> porton .
" there are a number of big rocks there , and i found a fine <unk> between them . "
" it 's rather dangerous to leave them around that way , " grumbled the man .
" maybe you would have done better if you had brought them over here . "
" i thought there would be no use in <unk> them back and forth , " returned the son .
" i wanted to have them handy , in case the <unk> met my demands . "
" well , we 'll see what comes of it , <name> .
i <name> we do get that money .
i certainly need some , " and jarvey porton heaved something of a sigh .
evidently father and son were equally unscrupulous and took no pains to disguise that fact from each other .
more talk followed , <name> telling something of the way in which the miniatures had been obtained and his father relating the particulars of his troubles with the mentor construction company .
in the midst of the latter recital <name> and <name> heard packard brown returning on the run .
" hi there ! "
called out the man in evident alarm .
and then as the two chums hid in the closet once more , he burst into the room occupied by the <unk> .
" those greasers are coming back and they are heading for this place ! "
he explained .
" in that case we had better get out , " answered jarvey porton , quickly .
" but you and brown helped them in that raid , dad , " interposed the son .
" why should you get out ? "
" we had a big quarrel after that raid , <name> , " explained the parent .
" and now those greasers have no use for us .
we 'll have to get out , and in a hurry , too . "
shouting could now be heard at a distance , and this was followed by a volley of shots which surprised all the listeners .
" i 'll tell you what it must be , " said jarvey porton , as he led the way from the deserted ranch .
" a detachment from the regular army must be after general <unk> 's crowd .
maybe they 'll have a fight right here along the border ! "
" i do n't want to get mixed up in any fight ! "
exclaimed <name> porton .
" maybe we had better get back to the united states side of the river . "
" that 's the talk ! "
put in packard brown .
" come on ! "
all left the ranch and headed directly for the river , at the point where <name> had left his flat-bottomed rowboat .
<name> and <name> followed them , but did their best to keep out of sight in the tall grass .
" oh , <name> , i <name> they do go over to the other shore ! "
exclaimed the senator 's son .
" it <name> be so much easier to capture them . "
" exactly , <name> .
and do n't you remember what <name> told his father  that he had left the miniature cases hidden on the other side ?
he said they were on a high knoll not far from where the boats had been tied up .
we ought to be able to find that <unk> . "
by the time the two chums gained the shore of the rio grande those ahead of them had already entered <name> porton 's boat .
<name> and brown each had an oar and rowed as rapidly as possible to the other side of the stream .
jarvey porton sat in the stern of the craft , and looked back from time to time , trying to catch sight of the <unk> and the other mexicans , who were still shouting and firing at a distance .
" had n't you better hold back a bit , <name> , so they do n't see you ? "
questioned <name> , as he and our hero managed to gain the rowboat they had used , which , fortunately , had been placed some distance away from the other craft .
" good advice , <name> , if it was n't for one thing .
i do n't want to give them a chance to get out of our sight .
let us tie our handkerchiefs over the lower parts of our faces .
then they wo n't be able to recognize us  at least unless we get pretty close . "
with <name> 's suggestion carried out , the chums leaped into the rowboat , and , this done , each took an oar .
they pulled hard , and as a consequence reached the mouth of the little creek on the united states side in time to see those ahead just <unk> .
" where do you suppose they are going ? "
queried the senator 's son .
" that remains to be found out , " answered <name> .
" duck now , so they wo n't see us . "
and with a quick motion of the oar he possessed he sent the flat-bottomed boat in among some tall grass which bordered the creek at this point .
<name> porton and those with him had tied up their boat and were walking to the higher ground away from the creek .
jarvey porton paused to look back along the creek and the bosom of the river beyond .
" i do n't see anything on the river just now , " he announced .
" look !
some one is coming from the other way ! "
exclaimed his son , suddenly .
" is that lawson , the ranchman ? "
questioned packard brown , anxiously .
" no , i do n't think it is , " answered <name> porton .
" they seem to be strangers , " he added , a minute later .
two men and a <unk> boy were approaching .
they came on slowly , as if looking for some one .
" i 'd like to know what those fellows want around here , " came from jarvey porton , as he gave up looking along the river to inspect the newcomers .
from their position in the tall grass bordering the creek , <name> and <name> looked from the porton party to those who were approaching .
then , of a sudden , our hero uttered a low exclamation of surprise .
" look who 's here , <name> !
<name> basswood and my uncle dunston !
and mr. andrews is with them ! "
" oh , <name> !
are you sure ? "
" of course i am !
i would know my uncle dunston as far as i could see him .
and you ought to know <name> . "
" my gracious , <name> , you 're right !
this sure is luck ! "
" i know what i 'm going to do , " decided our hero , quickly .
" i 'm going to send both of the boats adrift .
then , no matter what happens , those rascals wo n't have any easy time of it getting back to mexico . "
in feverish haste <name> sent the flat-bottomed boat out into the creek once more .
<name> assisted him , and a few strokes of the oars brought the craft alongside of that which had been used by the porton party .
then the chums leaped ashore , threw all the oars into the water , and set both of the rowboats adrift .
" hi there !
what are you fellows up to ? "
came suddenly from packard brown , who had happened to look behind him .
" see , jarvey , those two fellows have cast our boat adrift ! "
" who are they ? "
demanded jarvey porton , and looked in some bewilderment at the two figures approaching , each with a handkerchief tied over the lower portion of the face .
" uncle dunston !
<name> ! "
cried <name> at the top of his lungs , and at the same time whipped the handkerchief from his face .
" here are <name> porton and his father !
we must capture them ! "
" hurry up !
do n't let them get away ! "
put in <name> , as he , too , uncovered his face .
as he uttered the words <name> <name> his pistol , an action which was quickly followed by our hero , for both understood that the criminals before them might prove desperate .
of course dunston porton and <name> basswood , as well as <name> andrews , were greatly astonished by the calls from <name> and <name> .
but our hero 's uncle , while out hunting in various parts of the world , had been in many a tight corner , and thus learned the value of acting quickly .
he had with him his pistol , and almost instantly he <name> this weapon and came forward on the run , with <name> and <name> andrews at his heels .
" stop !
stop !
do n't shoot ! "
yelled <name> porton in alarm , as he found himself and his companions surrounded by five others , three with drawn pistols .
" we wo n't shoot , porton , if you 'll surrender , " answered <name> .
" oh , <name> !
has he got those miniatures ? "
burst out <name> .
" he sure has , <name> ! "
" good ! "
" i have n't got any miniatures , " growled the former moving-picture actor .
his father and brown looked decidedly uncomfortable .
once the former army officer made a motion as if to draw his own weapon , but dunston <name> detected the movement and instantly ordered all of the party to throw up their hands .
" oh , <name> !
are you sure he has those pictures ? "
queried <name> , and his face showed his anxiety .
" i think so , <name> .
however , we 'll find out as soon as we have made them prisoners . "
" that 's the talk ! "
put in <name> .
he turned to <name> 's uncle .
" ca n't you bind them or something , so that they ca n't get away ? "
" we 'll <unk> them , " announced <name> andrews .
" jarvey and brown are wanted for that raid on old man tolman 's ranch and for using that bomb on the bridge .
we can prove through <unk> that they were with the party . "
" that man is <name> porton 's father , " explained <name> to his uncle and <name> , while the evil-doers were being searched and disarmed one after another .
" <name> porton 's father , eh ?
well , they seem to be two of a kind , " answered <name> .
with their weapons taken from them , the prisoners could do nothing but submit .
they were questioned , but all refused to tell anything about what they had done or intended to do .
" you 'll never get anything out of me , and you 'll never get those miniatures back , " growled <name> porton , as he gazed sourly at <name> and at <name> .
" we 'll see about that , porton , " answered our hero .
and then he requested his uncle and <name> andrews to keep an eye on the prisoners while he , <name> and <name> set out for the knoll some distance away from the creek .
" <name> porton said he had hidden some cases in a <unk> between some rocks on that knoll , " explained our hero .
" by cases i think he meant those containing the miniatures . "
" oh , i <name> he did ! "
returned <name> , wistfully .
" to get those miniatures back means so much to my folks ! "
chapter xxx the fortune recovered  conclusion as <name> , <name> , and <name> tramped through the tall grass to where was located a knoll of considerable size , the son of the crumville real estate dealer related how he and dunston <name> had arrived in the construction camp and how they had gotten <name> andrews to show them in what direction our hero and the senator 's son had gone .
" we knew you were after porton , and we hoped to catch sight of that rascal , " went on <name> , " but we did n't dream that we were going to capture <name> and also those two men who are wanted for that raid on the tolman ranch .
and to think that one of the men is <name> 's father !
he certainly must be a bad egg ! "
" he is , <name> , " answered <name> .
" and <name> is a chip of the old block . "
the chums were soon ascending the knoll , containing many rocks between which were dense clumps of <unk> .
here they had to advance with care so as not to turn an ankle or get their clothing torn .
<name> had hoped that the search for the missing cases would be an easy one , but in that he was disappointed .
the three chums walked all around the knoll several times without getting anything in the way of a clue as to where porton 's <unk> was located .
" it 's a shame ! "
burst out <name> at length .
" if we could only  " he looked quickly at <name> .
" what do you see ? "
our hero did not reply .
instead he hurried forward several feet , and then gave a low cry .
" porton has been here ! "
he exclaimed , and held up a <unk> cigarette .
it was not much of a clue , but it was something ; and working on this all three of the youths searched the vicinity diligently .
they soon came upon a somewhat flat rock , and all seized hold of this to cast it to one side .
" hurrah ! "
came simultaneously from <name> and <name> , as they saw a large opening under where the stone had been placed .
<name> said nothing , but plunged his hand into the opening , to draw from it an instant later one of the cases that had contained the enos miniatures .
the other cases quickly followed .
" are the miniatures in them ? "
questioned the senator 's son .
" that 's what i 'm going to find out , " answered <name> .
the cases were fastened by several catches , but these were quickly unfastened and the lids thrown open .
" good !
good ! "
exclaimed <name> , and his face showed his intense satisfaction .
there before the eyes of the youths were nearly all of the wonderful collection of miniatures which mr. basswood had inherited .
only two were missing  those which the thieves had sold in new york .
" oh , this is simply grand ! "
cried <name> , enthusiastically .
" that 's what it is , " added <name> , and then went on quickly : " we 'll have to get these to some safe place and then make sure that they 'll never be stolen again . "
" do n't you worry about that , <name> .
i wo n't let them out of my sight until they are safe and sound , " declared the real estate <unk> son .
locking up the cases once more , the three youths carried them off the knoll and through the <unk> to where they had left dunston <name> and the others .
of course , <name> 's uncle was much gratified to learn that the miniatures had been recovered , and <name> andrews was also pleased .
jarvey porton looked downcast , and his son showed his deep disgust .
" i was a fool not to take them over into mexico , " remarked the former moving-picture actor .
" well , i told you that was what you should have done , " retorted his father .
and then he added in a low tone : " we might have purchased our freedom with those miniatures . "
while dunston <name> and <name> andrews looked after the prisoners to see that they did not get away , <name> and his chums took care of the cases containing the precious miniatures , and thus the whole party made its way to the engineering and construction camp .
there the <unk> and packard brown were handcuffed , and word was sent to the authorities to take charge of them .
" and now i 've got to send word home about this good news ! "
cried <name> , and lost no time in getting off a long telegram to his folks , and asking them to inform <name> 's father and the wadsworths by telephone of the success of the trip to texas .
" that message ought to do your father more good than a dose of medicine , " remarked <name> .
" it <name> , <name> , " answered <name> , his face beaming .
" i know father <name> recover now that he has nothing more to worry about . "
<name> was right .
the recovery of the fortune in miniatures did much toward restoring the real estate dealer to his former good health .
in the camp it was remarked by a number of men how much <name> porton resembled <name> .
but no one at that time dreamed that this resemblance was shortly to come to an end .
yet such was a fact .
when being transferred from texas to the state in which his crimes had been committed , <name> porton attempted to make his escape by leaping from a rapidly moving railroad train .
as a consequence he broke not only both of his legs , but also his nose , and cut his right cheek most frightfully .
as a result , when he was <unk> he had to remain in the hospital for a long time , and when he came out his face was much disfigured and he walked with a decided limp .
" it 's too bad , but he brought it on himself , " was <name> 's comment , when he heard of this .
" it 's a good thing in one respect , " was <name> 's reply .
" with his nose broken and his cheek disfigured and with such a limp , no one <name> ever take <name> porton for you again . "
it may be mentioned here that when the proper time came <name> porton and <name> crapsey were brought to trial and each was given a long term of imprisonment .
<name> 's father and the other men who had participated in the attack on the tolman ranch and on the bridge and had been captured were also severely punished .
the <unk> and the hotel-keeper who suffered through <name> porton 's <unk> could get nothing from the young culprit , but they had the satisfaction of knowing that he had now been put where it would be impossible for him to dupe others .
<name> basswood remained at the camp but a few days , and then he and dunston <name> started northward .
the miniatures had been boxed up and shipped by express , insured for their full value .
it may be stated here that they arrived safely at their destination .
those which had been disposed of in new york city were recovered , and in the end mr. basswood disposed of the entire collection to the museums in four of our large cities for the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars .
with part of this money he went into several heavy real estate deals , taking <name> in with him , and father and son did very well .
" i think the getting back of those miniatures was entirely your work , <name> , " declared <name> , one day .
" i do n't know about that , " answered our hero , modestly .
" i think you had a hand in it . "
" i had a hand in catching <name> porton , but you were the one to spot that <unk> and locate the basswood fortune . "
* * * * * and now let me add a few words more and then bring to an end this story of " <name> <name> and his double . "
a number of years have passed since <name> graduated from oak hall and took up the profession of a civil engineer .
both he and <name> learned rapidly , and at the end of the required time both passed their final examinations with flying colors .
they remained with the mentor construction company , journeying all over the united states , and also going down into mexico and into central and south <unk> .
they , of course , met with numerous adventures , some of which i may relate to you at a future time .
they returned to crumville a number of times , and during those visits <name> was more attentive to <name> than ever , while <name> spent nearly all his time at <name> 's side .
" they 'll make a fine pair of married couples , " declared <name> 's uncle dunston .
" well , i <name> they 'll be happy , " answered <name> 's father .
" they certainly deserve to be . "
" you are right .
but i guess they had better wait awhile yet . "
" of course .
they are young , and <name> and <name> want to get a good foothold in their profession . "
" those boys have had some strenuous doings , " continued the uncle .
" i wonder what <name> happen next ? "
" something , that 's certain , " answered <name> 's father ; and he was right , as <name> be related in my next volume , to be entitled , " <name> <unk> great search ; or , the perils of a young civil engineer . "
in that book we <name> meet all our young friends again , and learn the particulars of <name> wadsworth 's strange disappearance .
" great days , those  on the rio grande , <name> ! "
remarked <name> , one day , when the two had been discussing what had taken place in the past .
" yes , <name> , they certainly were great days , " answered our hero .
" no matter what exciting times may come in the future , i 'll never forget how i helped to capture my double . "
" and how we managed to become full-fledged civil engineers , <name> . "
" yes , that was just as good as getting back the basswood miniatures , if not better , " answered <name> .
here , at the height of his success in his chosen profession , we <name> wish <name> <name> well , and say good-bye .

preface " <name> <name> and his rivals " is a complete story in itself , but forms the seventh volume in a line issued under the general title of " <name> <name> series . "
when i brought out the first volume of this series , entitled " <name> <name> at oak hall , " i trusted that the story would please the young people for whom it was written , but i did not imagine that so many thousands of boys and girls all over our broad land would take to <name> as they have , and would insist upon knowing more about him .
my opening tale was one of boarding school life , and this was followed by " <name> <name> in the south seas , " whither our hero had gone in search of his father , and then by " <name> <name> 's return to school , " in which book <name> met all of his friends again and likewise a few of his enemies .
so far our hero had heard about his father , but had not yet seen his parent , and the next volume , " <name> <name> in the far north , " related the particulars of a trip to norway , where the youth had some stirring adventures amid snow and ice in the land of the midnight sun .
coming back to <name> , the lad was sent again to oak hall , as set down in the next volume , called " <name> <name> and his classmates . "
during that term at school many complications arose , and our hero did something for the honor of oak hall that was a great credit to him .
<name> 's father was now with him , but his sister <name> was in the far west , and upon her return he received an invitation to visit a large ranch , and how he went , and what strenuous times he had , were related in " <name> <name> at <name> ranch . "
as soon as his western outing was at an end , <name> returned home , and then betook himself once more to oak hall .
here , to his surprise , he found an unusual state of affairs , the particulars of which are given in the pages that follow .

another victory  conclusion <name> <name> and his rivals chapter i an automobile ride " everybody ready ? "
" yes , <name> ; let her go ! "
cried <name> <name> .
" how about you folks in the other auto ? "
queried <name> <name> , as he let off the hand brake and advanced the spark and lever of the machine he was about to run .
" we are all ready , " responded <name> morr .
" been ready for an hour , " added <name> basswood , who sat beside <name> .
" oh , <name> , not quite as long as that ! "
burst out <name> <name> , who was one of three girls in the tonneau of the second car .
" well , make it fifty-eight minutes then ; i 'm not particular , " responded <name> , calmly .
" are the lunch <unk> in ? "
asked <name> wadsworth , anxiously .
" mamma said we mus n't forget anything . "
" trust <name> and <name> to look after the food , " burst out <name> <name> .
" likewise mr. <name> <name> , " added <name> .
" just wait till it comes lunch time , and you 'll see <name> stow away about fifteen chicken sandwiches , ten slices of cake , three pickles , five olives   " " stop !
i draw the line on olives , <name> ! "
cried <name> , making a wry face .
" oh , olives are fine ; i love them ! "
cried <name> endicott .
" then all that are coming to me are yours , " returned <name> , quickly .
" but start her up , fellows , if we are going ! "
he added , and then , putting a big horn to his lips , he blew a loud blast .
" take good care of yourselves ! "
cried a voice from the veranda of the mansion in front of which the two automobiles were standing , and mrs. wadsworth waved a hand to the young people .
" we 'll try to , " answered <name> , and then he threw in the clutch on low gear , and the big touring car moved gently away , out of the grounds of the wadsworth mansion and into the main highway leading from crumville to shady <name> falls .
the second car speedily followed .
it was a late summer day , with a clear blue sky overhead and just enough breeze blowing to <unk> the air .
a shower of rain the day previous had laid the dust of the road and added to the freshness of fields and woods .
the boys and girls had planned this outing for several days .
all of the youths were to return to oak hall school the following week , and they wished to do something for the girls to remember them by , as <name> expressed it .
" might have a party , " <name> had suggested .
" no good , unless it was a lawn party , " <name> had answered .
" it 's too stuffy in the house , these warm days . "
" we might take a couple of autos and go for a day 's outing up the river road , " <name> had suggested , and this proposition had been accepted immediately .
it was decided that <name> should run the wadsworth machine , he having learned to do so some time before , and <name> was to run a car hired at the new crumville garage .
each car had a capacity of five passengers , including the driver , and the party consisted of ten young people , five boys and five girls .
" now , <name> , do n't let her out for more than fifty miles an hour , " remarked <name> day , who sat in the back of the leading auto , between two of the young ladies .
" fifty miles an hour ! "
shrieked <name> wadsworth .
" what an idea !
<name> , do n't you dare ! "
" oh , lazy is only fooling , <name> , " answered <name> .
" he would n't want to ride at that rate of speed himself . "
" twenty miles an hour is fast enough , " said <name> endicott .
" i want to view the scenery .
it is lovely around crumville  so different from around the ranch . "
" yes , the scenery is fine , even though we have n't such big mountains as you have out west , " answered <name> .
" and shady <name> falls is an ideal spot for a picnic , " said <name> .
" papa took us there last summer . "
" you 've got to make the most of the falls this summer , " went on <name> .
" i heard in town last week that next year a paper company is going to put a mill there . "
" oh , <name> , is that the eureka paper company ? "
questioned <name> .
" yes .
what do you know about them ? "
" why , i heard papa and your uncle talking about it .
it is a company in which mr. <name> poole holds a big interest . "
" <name> poole ! "
murmured the youthful driver of the automobile , and his face grew serious , as he remembered the trouble he had had with that mean individual .
" yes .
papa heard nat bragging down at the post-office , about what great things his father was going to do , when the paper company got started . "
" that 's just like nat poole , " was <name> <name> 's comment .
" if nat could n't brag about something he 'd die . "
" by the way , where does nat keep himself ? "
questioned <name> day .
" i have n't met him since i came to crumville . "
" he has been keeping shady  since our little affair at niagara falls , " explained <name> .
" is he going to return to oak hall ? "
" i presume so .
he left his motor-boat and some other things up there , so i heard . "
" we can get along without nat poole , <name> . "
" right you are , lazy , " put in <name> <name> .
" but maybe , with link merwell gone , he wo n't be quite so bad as he was . "
" oh , that horrid link merwell ! "
cried <name> .
" i trust we never see or hear of him again ! "
" well , one thing is certain , merwell <name> never get back to oak hall , " said <name> .
" he got his walking papers and that settled it .
he is out for good , the same as <name> jasniff . "
" <name> , have you heard anything about jasniff lately ? "
questioned <name> .
" one of the boys wrote that he had heard <name> had returned to the united states .
personally , i have n't seen or heard from him since we met in europe  and i do n't want to see him , " added <name> , earnestly .
toot !
toot !
came from behind the leading automobile , and a moment later the second car ranged up alongside .
" guess you folks are doing more talking than running ! "
cried <name> , with a grin .
" here is where we show you the road ! "
and in a twinkling the second car shot ahead , and was " hitting her up , " as <name> expressed it , at thirty miles an hour .
<name> immediately turned on more speed likewise , and over the smooth , straight road both machines spun .
" oh , <name> , is it safe ? "
asked <name> , with a little gasp , as the speed increased .
" yes ,  as long as we are on the straight road , " he answered .
" we 'll have to slow down at the turn . "
" i like to ride fast  but not too fast , " said <name> basswood , <unk> cousin , the other girl in the car .
the turn in the road was almost gained , and both machines had slowed down once more , when there came a shrill , screeching whistle from behind , and a racing car shot into sight , moving along with a great noise , for the <unk> had been cut out .
all of the girls screamed in fright , and instinctively <name> and <name> ran their cars as close to the right side of the road as possible .
then , with a roar , the racing car shot past , sending up a cloud of dust , and a shower of small stones , one of which hit <name> <name> in the cheek , and another striking <name> in the ear .
" fellows that run that way ought to be arrested , " was <name> 's comment .
" oh , i was so afraid we should be struck ! "
gasped <name> , sinking back into her seat with a white face .
" did you recognize them ? "
asked <name> endicott .
" i did n't have time to look , " answered <name> .
" i was busy getting out of the way . "
" just what i was doing , " added <name> .
" i did n't want them to take off the <unk> , or a wheel . "
" i caught sight of one of the fellows , " said <name> basswood .
" he looked right at me as he passed . "
" who was it ? "
questioned several eagerly .
" nat poole . "
" nat poole ! "
cried <name> .
" surely , he was n't driving that racing car . "
" no , he was in the rear , with another chap ,  and two were on the front seat .
but i did n't recognize any of the others . "
" i saw that machine in crumville last week , " said <name> .
" i believe it belongs in <unk> . "
" i <name> those fellows are not bound for shady <name> falls , " said <name> .
" it would quite spoil our outing , to have such persons around . "
" a picnic like ours would be dead slow for that crowd , " remarked <name> .
" if they stop anywhere , it <name> be most likely at some <unk> , where they can drink and smoke , and play pool and cards . "
the racing car had long since disappeared in the distance , and now the other automobiles proceeded on their way .
the girls were very nervous , and the boys did all in their power to remove the strain .
but the girls declared that they had had a narrow escape from a serious accident , and it put much of a damper on the trip .
" if ever i meet the driver of that car i 'll give him a piece of my mind , " said <name> .
" it 's against the law to run at such high speed . "
the distance to shady <name> falls from crumville was thirty-five miles .
the last half of the journey was over a winding dirt road , and the boys had calculated that it would take them two hours to reach the picnic grounds .
" we 'll go by way of <name> 's corners , and come back by way of <unk> , " said <name> .
" that <name> give us a sort of round trip . "
and so it was decided .
<name> 's corners was but five miles from the falls .
it was only a small settlement , boasting of a tavern , a blacksmith shop , a church , and two stores .
as they came in sight of the place <name> uttered a cry : " there is that racing car now ! "
<name> was right , the car stood in front of the tavern , the engine still running and letting out short puffs of smoke .
" where are the fellows who were in it ? "
questioned <name> .
" must have gone inside for a drink , " answered <name> .
" here come two of them now , " said <name> , in a low voice , as the tavern door swung open and two young men appeared , each wearing a linen duster and a touring cap .
" it 's nat poole ! "
cried <name> .
" i know that driver , " said <name> .
" he is <name> barnaby , a sport from <unk> .
he used to follow the horse races before <unk> became popular .
he once tried to sell caspar potts a horse , but we found out the animal was doctored up and worthless , and we did n't take him .
barnaby was furious when the deal fell through . "
" i 've heard of him , " said <name> .
" he wanted to sell my father a horse , but father would n't have anything to do with him . "
while the boys were talking the tavern door had swung open again , and now two other persons stepped forth .
they , too , wore linen <unk> and touring caps , and one carried a basket containing something to eat and to drink .
" <name> ! "
cried <name> , in astonishment .
" look who they are ! "
" link merwell and <name> jasniff ! "
murmured <name> .
" how in the world did they get here , and what underhanded work are they up to now ? "
chapter ii <name> and his past <name> <name> had good reasons for looking upon link merwell and <name> jasniff with suspicion .
in the past these two <unk> had caused <name> a good deal of trouble , and when exposed each had vowed that sooner or later he would " square accounts " with the youth who had gotten the better of him .
<name> had hoped he had seen the last of them , but here they were , eyeing him closely , each with a face that plainly showed his envy and his hatred .
to those of you who have read the preceding volumes of this series <name> <name> and his friends and enemies <name> need no special introduction .
for the benefit of others let me explain that <name> had once upon a time been a homeless child , having been found wandering along the railroad tracks near crumville .
he was placed in the local poorhouse , and later on bound out to a broken-down college professor named caspar potts , who had taken to farming for his health .
professor potts could not make farming pay , and was in danger of being sold out by <name> poole , the father of nat poole , already introduced , when a most unexpected happening changed the whole current of events .
in the town lived mr. <name> wadsworth , a <name> manufacturer .
he had a young daughter named <name> , and one day , when this miss was waiting for an automobile ride , the gasoline tank of the machine took fire , and <name> was in danger of being burned to death when <name> rushed in and rescued her .
" a boy who <name> do such a brave deed deserves to be assisted , " said mr. wadsworth , and he talked to the boy , and learned that caspar potts had once been one of his own college professors .
arrangements were at once made for the professor and <name> to move to the wadsworth mansion , and then <name> was sent to boarding school , as related in detail in my first volume , entitled " <name> <name> at oak hall . "
with <name> went <name> basswood , his one chum in crumville .
at the school <name> made a number of friends , including <name> morr , who was the son of a united states senator ; <name> <name> , the offspring of a wealthy shipowner ; <name> day , usually called lazy , because of a habit he had of taking his time , and others whom we shall meet in the near future .
in those days , <name> 's greatest trouble was the cloud over his parentage , and when he got what he thought was a clew to his identity he promptly followed it up by taking a trip far across the ocean , as related in " <name> <name> in the south seas . "
after some stirring happenings , on <unk> and among the natives , he located his uncle , dunston <name> , and learned much concerning his father , <name> <unk> <name> , and his sister <name> , then traveling in europe .
after his trip to the south sea islands , the lad returned to oak hall , as related in the third volume , called " <name> <name> 's return to school . "
here he was warmly received by his many friends , and became more popular than ever , much to the disgust of link merwell , <name> jasniff , and also nat poole , who had followed him to oak hall from crumville .
" <name> <name> puts up a big front , but i 'll take him down a <name> or two , " said <name> jasniff , and he forced a fight with the crumville lad .
much to his surprise he was knocked down and badly whipped , and then , in a sudden brutal rage , he snatched up an indian club and might have inflicted serious injury to <name> had not the latter seized him , while others forced the weapon from his grasp .
then , in alarm , jasniff ran away from oak hall , and having gotten himself mixed up with some men who were wanted for a robbery , he left the country .
during this term at the school <name> was anxiously awaiting to hear from his father and his sister .
then came word , through jasniff , who tried to <unk> <name> , that mr. <name> and <name> were in europe , and the youth determined to go in search of them .
<name> accompanied him , and what befell the pair was related in detail in " <name> <name> in the far north . "
in england <name> ran across <name> jasniff , and compelled the fellow to tell what he knew of mr. <name> , and then <name> followed his parent to the upper part of norway , where father and son at last met , under conditions far out of the ordinary .
<name> <name> , not knowing anything of <name> 's existence , had gone from europe to the ranch home of her friends , the <unk> .
she returned to crumville , to meet her long-lost brother , and then <name> again returned to oak hall , as told of in " <name> <name> and his classmates . "
jasniff was gone , but link merwell and nat poole remained , and both did what they could to dim <name> 's popularity .
link merwell was particularly obnoxious , and in the end <name> took matters in his own hands and gave the bully the thrashing he richly deserved .
then some of the fellow 's <unk> reached the ears of the master of the school , and he was ordered to pack his trunk and leave , which he did in a great rage .
" it is all <name> <name> 's doings ! "
said link merwell , bitterly .
" but wait  i 'll square up with him , see if i do n't ! "
<name> <name> and <name> endicott were great friends , and through the latter <name> and her brother received an invitation to visit the endicott ranch in the far west , and this they did , as related in the volume entitled " <name> <name> at <name> ranch . "
they took with them <name> wadsworth and also <name> and <name> .
on the way they met nat poole at niagara falls , and poole attempted to play a mean trick on <name> .
but the latter turned the tables on the money-lender 's son , and the latter went back home a wiser if not a better boy .
the endicott ranch was located next to one owned by link <unk> father , and , as was to be expected , it was not long before there was a clash between <name> and his party on one side and merwell and his followers on the other .
link merwell , as usual , did all in his power to injure <name> , and make the outing for the others a failure , but he was caught in his own trap , and it was proved that he had , to a certain extent , aided some horse-thieves in their nefarious work .
mr. merwell had to pay mr. endicott for the animals that were missing , and , in order to hush the matter up , he agreed to sell his ranch and move to some other part of the country .
" well , i <name> that is the last of link merwell , so far as we are concerned , " said <name> at the time .
" we can do very well without such chaps as merwell and <name> jasniff , " <name> had added , with a grim smile .
" yes , and without such fellows as nat poole , too , " <name> had put in .
" although i must say i do n't think nat is as bad as link and <name> . "
" nat is too much of a dude to be real bad , " said <name> .
" nat lacks backbone , " explained <name> .
" he usually does what the others tell him to .
but jasniff and merwell are both wicked fellows , and jasniff is brutal . "
the home-coming from the ranch had been a <name> occasion at the wadsworth mansion , and the young people had been warmly welcomed by <unk> parents and by mr. <name> and caspar potts .
<name> basswood had come over from his home to greet them , and he brought with him <name> day , who was paying him a visit .
" i suppose you are all going back to oak hall , " remarked <name> to the boys .
" of course , " answered <name> .
" you are going back , are n't you ? "
" sure thing  and so are all of the others of our old crowd . "
" we must make the best of what vacation is left before we get down to the grind again , " remarked the senator 's son , and the next day the matter was talked over , with the result that the automobile trip to shady <name> falls was proposed and decided upon .
all had started out in the best of spirits , never dreaming of the trouble that was in store for them .
" <name> , what are you going to do ? "
whispered <name> , as he , too , recognized the crowd coming toward the racing car .
before <name> could answer , nat poole strode forward with a sickly smile on his face .
" hello , there ! "
he cried , and nodded curtly to the girls .
" out for a ride , i see . "
" nat , who was driving your car ? "
asked <name> , sharply .
" what business is that of yours , <name> <name> ? "
questioned the dudish youth , quickly .
" you came pretty close to running us down .
you were speeding altogether too fast . "
" ho !
ho !
we scared you , did we ? "
returned nat .
" sorry for the girls , i'm sure , " and his face took on a mean little grin .
" what are you finding fault about , <name> <name> ? "
demanded <name> barnaby , the owner of the racing car , coming closer .
his nose was very red , and his breath smelt strongly of liquor .
" i am finding fault with the way your car was run , if you want to know it , " answered <name> , stoutly .
" we are not asking you for advice . "
" perhaps not , but if you try any such trick again , <name> barnaby , you may get yourself into trouble . "
" you were exceeding the speed limit , " put in <name> .
" and you came close to running us down , " added <name> .
" oh , you boys are a timid bunch , " grumbled the owner of the racing car .
" i did n't come within ten feet of touching you . "
" of course they are a timid crowd , " said <name> jasniff , loudly .
" if they had any sand they would n't say anything about it . "
" you 're a nice one to talk about <unk> , ' after what <name> did to you at the school <unk> , " was <name> 's sarcastic comment .
" look here , <name> <name> , i do n't want any of your hot air ! "
cried <name> jasniff , in a sudden rage .
" you keep your mouth shut . "
" it 's a wonder you did n't stay in europe , jasniff , " said <name> .
" i didn't think you 'd dare to come back to the united states . "
" say , you need n't   " began jasniff , and then <name> back , looking much disturbed .
" you  er  you need n't rake up old times .
those things are all settled , and i 've got as much right to be here as you have . "
" well , you wo n't come back to oak hall , " said <name> .
" do n't want to come back .
i 'm going to a better school . "
" and so am i , " said link merwell , as if he was anxious to make the fact known to his former schoolmates .
" i do n't care where you go , so long as you do n't bother us any more , " rejoined <name> .
" oh , you have n't seen the end of us yet , has he , <name> ? "
said link merwell , appealing to his crony .
" not much he has n't , " retorted <name> jasniff .
" we are going to rockville military academy , " continued link merwell , mentioning a school which , as my old readers know , was located not a great distance from oak hall .
in the past there had been many contests between the students of the two seats of learning , and the rivalry was very bitter .
" rockville ! "
cried the senator 's son .
" i should n't think they 'd want you there . "
" say , you take that back , or i 'll  i 'll   " blustered merwell , and then stopped , not knowing how to proceed .
" oh , say , come on , you fellows , " broke in nat poole , who was growing scared , thinking there might be a fight .
" you can talk this over some other time .
just remember what we started out to do .
hurry up , let 's do it , " and he motioned his companions towards the racing car .
" i 'm ready to go ahead , " answered <name> barnaby , climbing into the driver 's seat .
" come on , pile in , if you 're going . "
" i do n't want <name> <name> and his crowd to think i am afraid of them , " growled link merwell .
" we 'll meet you after you get back to oak hall , " sang out <name> jasniff .
" and we 'll settle old scores . "
" well , you look out that you do n't get your fingers burnt trying to do it ! "
retorted <name> .
and then the racing car started off and was speedily lost to view around a turn of the road .
chapter iii what happened at the falls " what horrid young fellows ! "
was <name> 's comment .
she was trembling from head to foot and her face was pale .
" do n't mind what they say , " answered <name> , kindly .
he thought a great deal of the girl , and it distressed him greatly to see her so worried .
" i should n't think they 'd want jasniff and merwell at rockville , " was the comment of the senator 's son .
" everybody in that town knows how jasniff was mixed up in that railroad station affair . "
he referred to a robbery committed by some men , the particulars of which were recorded in " <name> <name> 's return to school . "
<name> jasniff had been in company with the evil-doers , but his share in the transaction had been smoothed over and hushed up by his family .
" well , i heard that the military academy was rather hard up for pupils this term , " answered <name> .
" about a dozen of the sophs and juniors left , and the <unk> of freshmen was rather slim .
i suppose on that account the authorities ca n't be <unk> particular as to who they take in . "
" and of course merwell and jasniff had their sides of their stories to tell , " said <name> .
" you can be sure they did n't tell matters as doctor <name> would have done . "
" or as we might have done  had we been asked , " broke in <name> .
" well , i <name> you boys keep away from them when you get to school , " said <name> .
" what do you suppose they are up to now , <name> ? "
asked the shipowner's son .
" i do n't know , <name> ; but from the look on nat poole 's face i should think   " and then <name> stopped short .
" what ? "
" well , never mind now .
i may be wrong , and there is no use of worrying .
come on , let us get to the falls ,  and try to forget that crowd . "
and so speaking , <name> started up the touring car he was running , and followed in the direction <name> barnaby had taken , and <name> came after him .
the meeting at the tavern had disturbed all of the girls , and the boys had hard work trying to cheer them up and make them forget the unpleasant encounter .
everybody felt that there was " something in the air , " but each person hated to mention it to the others .
presently <name> reached the point where they would have to take to a side road that was deep with dust and hemmed in on both sides by rocks and bushes .
here , in the dust , could plainly be seen the marks of another automobile .
" think they came this way , <name> ? "
questioned <name> .
" yes ,  although some other folks may be at the falls on an outing . "
" oh , i <name> we do n't meet them again ! "
said <name> endicott .
the two machines were running slowly and close together .
they passed on around a long curve , and over a small hill , and then came in sight of the river , glistening in the <name> between the trees .
from a distance came the roar of the falls , where a fairly large body of water rushed steadily over the rocks .
" is n't it a shame that they are going to use the falls for a mill ! "
said one of the girls .
" well , this is a commercial age , and so one must expect those things , " answered <name> .
" but i shall hate to see the falls used for business .
they are so pretty . "
there was another turn just ahead , and it was lucky for <name> that he was running slowly , for there , across the road , were placed several logs and dead limbs of trees .
as it was , he ran directly on top of some of the tree limbs before he could come to a stop , and <name> , so close behind , had to turn into some bushes to avoid <unk> the car in front .
" well , of all things ! "
burst out <name> , while several of the girls screamed in fright .
" who did this ? "
demanded the senator 's son .
" it is easy to see who did it , " answered <name> .
" see the sign ? "
and he pointed to a big white card , tacked to a post propped up among the logs and tree limbs .
on the card was painted , in red , the following : this road closed by order of <name> poole <unk> .
eureka paper co. " this is some of nat 's work ! "
burst out <name> .
" that is why he was in such a hurry to get ahead of us . "
" i believe you , " answered <name> .
" i was afraid he was up to some trick , but i did n't want to say anything about it until i was sure . "
" but if nat is guilty , how did he know we were coming here ? "
asked <name> .
" i guess i can explain that , " said <name> .
" i was talking to my cousin about it , down at the drug store .
just as we were coming out , after having some soda , i saw nat behind one of the partitions .
he must have heard all we said , and i suppose it made him mad to think we were going to have a good time , and that he would n't be in it . "
" exactly , " returned <name> .
" just as he was mad when he was n't invited to the party , and tried to spoil the ice-cream . "
" do you suppose they have a right to close the road ? "
questioned <name> .
" i do n't know .
i always thought this was a public highway . "
" so it is , " added <name> .
" the paper company bought the ground on one side of the road but not on the other .
i do n't think they can stop us from going through , even though they may stop us from going down to the falls . "
" but if we ca n't go to the falls , what is the use of keeping on this road ? "
asked <name> .
" we can go above the falls , <name> , " answered her brother .
" there is a beautiful spot there called lookout point , where you can look out all over the valley . "
the matter was talked over for a few minutes , and the boys decided to go ahead , to show that they considered that they had a right to use the road , even if they did not go down to the falls .
the roadway was cleared sufficiently to let the cars pass , and the power was turned on once again .
" be careful , <name> , that you do n't run into more trouble ! "
sang out <name> .
" i 'll be on the lookout ! "
was the answer .
" and you be prepared to stop quick , too , so as not to run into me . "
" i 'll drop back to a place of safety , " returned the senator 's son .
" there is no use of keeping so close together , anyway . "
the road wound in and out among the trees , and in some spots was so narrow that the boys had to run with great care , for fear of bumping into the stump of a tree or on the rocks , or switching into some <unk> branch .
<name> had his foot on the brake , ready to stop quickly , should it become necessary to do so .
" hi , there !
stop !
do n't you dare to come any further ! "
the call was an unexpected one , coming just as the leading automobile hove in sight of the falls .
<name> saw nat poole hurrying towards him , followed by merwell and jasniff .
<name> barnaby was nowhere in sight , and the marks on the narrow road told that his racing car had gone on ahead .
" what do you want , nat ? "
asked <name> , as coolly as he could , having brought his machine to a standstill .
" ca n't you read , <name> <name> ? "
fumed the son of the crumville money-lender .
" certainly i can read . "
" well , then , what are you doing on this road ?
you know it is closed .
you have n't any right on it at all  you or anybody else .
you turn around and go back , just as quick as you can . "
" this is a public road , nat poole ! "
cried <name> .
" you had n't any right to put up that sign . "
" humph !
a lot you know about it , <name> basswood !
this is my father 's land , and i reckon he knows his rights .
you are not going down to the falls to-day to have your picnic . "
and nat 's small eyes gleamed maliciously .
" we do n't intend to go down to the falls ,  now that we know how matters stand , " said <name> .
" but we are going through on this road . "
" not much you ai n't  not another step ! "
roared nat .
" that 's right , nat , make 'em keep off your property , " put in link merwell .
" show 'em that you wo n't allow a poorhouse nobody to dictate to you , " added <name> jasniff , but in such a low voice that <name> did not catch all he said .
" i said we were going through on this road  and we are , " answered <name> , calmly , and he started to turn on the power again .
as he did this nat poole leaped to the road directly in front of the touring car , and jasniff and merwell followed suit .
" stop !
do n't you dare to touch me , or i 'll have the law on you ! "
screamed the money-lender 's son .
" we 'll fix 'em for you , nat ! "
cried <name> jasniff .
" come on , link , get to work ! "
and leaping to one side of the roadway he dragged forth the dead limb of a tree and dropped it in front of the first car .
quick to understand , merwell followed with another dead limb , and then with some stones .
" that 's the stuff ! "
cried nat poole , his face brightening .
" pile it up , fellows ! "
and he , too , ran for some sticks and stones , with which to make the barrier in the narrow roadway more complete .
had <name> elected so to do he might have gone ahead when first this work was done by the enemy .
but there was danger of injury both to the big touring car and to those in the roadway , and he did not wish to take the risk .
besides , there was no telling if <name> could get through , and he would not leave the crowd in the second automobile in the lurch .
" now , i reckon you 'll have to turn back ! "
cried nat poole , in triumph , after so much had been piled in the roadway that passing was totally out of the question .
" nat poole , i believe you are the meanest boy in the whole world ! "
cried <name> , and there was a suspicion of tears in her eyes as she spoke .
" humph !
you people need n't think that you are going to have the best of me all the time , " growled nat .
" we are not doing this against any of the young ladies , " said link merwell , with a smirk at <name> that made <name> 's sister turn away in disdain .
" we are only doing it to square accounts with <name> <name> and his cronies .
we owe them a good deal ,  and this is the first <unk> . "
" with a good deal more to follow ! "
added <name> jasniff , with a wicked chuckle .
" to the best of my knowledge and belief , this is a public highway , " said <name> , as calmly as he could .
" you have no right to block the road , and i want you to clear that stuff away just as fast as you put it there . "
" hear him talk ! "
cried link merwell .
" you 'd think he was governor of the state , would n't you ? "
" do n't you mind what he says , nat , " said jasniff .
" if they start to take the stuff away we 'll put it back . "
and then , looking around , he picked up a heavy stick which might be used for a club .
he was spoiling for a fight , and only the presence of the girls , and the fact that he and his cohorts were but three against five , kept him from attacking <name> .
" oh , <name> , what shall we do ? "
whispered <name> .
she was becoming more frightened every minute .
" i do n't see how we are going to turn around , " said one of the other girls .
" the trees are too close to the sides of the road . "
" we are not going to turn around , " answered <name> , and his face took on a stern look .
he turned to his chums .
" how about it ? "
" i 'll fight them before i turn back ! "
answered <name> .
" so <name> i , " added <name> .
" i do n't believe they have any more right to this road than we have . "
" oh , you must n't fight , " cried <name> .
" do you want to let that crowd crow over us , <name> ? "
asked <name> , flatly .
" no , no , <name> !
but  but   " and then <name> stopped short , not knowing what to say .
she did not wish to see an encounter , nor did she wish her brother and his chums to give in to those who were so unjustly opposing them .
chapter iv an unexpected arrival " this is the time we get the best of <name> <name> ! "
whispered link merwell to his cronies .
" i guess we have spoiled their picnic . "
" i  i  do n't think th  they 'll fight , " faltered nat , as <name> leaped to the ground , followed by his chums .
" better arm yourselves with clubs , " suggested <name> jasniff .
" remember , we are only three to five . "
" maybe we had better  er  go away , " returned the money-lender 's son , hesitatingly .
" no , i am going to see the thing out , " answered jasniff .
" so am i , " added merwell .
" do n't go , nat  they wo n't dare to fight  with the girls looking on . "
" whoa , there !
whoa ! "
came a cry from behind the two touring cars , and looking back the boys and girls saw a man drive up on a buckboard drawn by a spirited horse .
" why , if it is n't <name> sully ! "
cried <name> .
" who is he ? "
questioned <name> .
" sort of a <unk> in these parts .
i suppose he is going around , inspecting the roads and bridges . "
" then he ought to be able to tell us about this road ! "
put in <name> , quickly .
" hello !
what 's the meaning of this ? "
demanded <name> sully , after alighting .
and he strode forward and confronted the boys .
" how are you , mr .
sully ? "
said <name> , for he had met the <unk> before .
" oh , so it 's you , <name> !
blocked up , eh ? "
and the <unk> looked first at <name> and his chums and then at those standing on the other side of the barrier .
" who did this ? "
" they did , " answered <name> , and pointed to the other crowd .
" what for ? "
and the <unk> 's voice grew a bit hard .
" nat poole , there , claims that his father has a right to close this road , " explained <name> .
" he put up a barrier some distance back , but we passed it .
now he and his friends have put up this . "
" and we want to know if they have a right to do it , " added <name> .
" i had an idea the new paper company bought only one side of the road . "
" so it did , " answered <name> sully .
" and even if it bought both sides it could n't close off this road , which is a public highway . "
he turned to nat .
" are you <name> poole 's son ? "
" <unk> , " faltered the youth addressed , and he commenced to look worried .
" did your father give you orders to close off this road ? "
" why  er  he  that is , " stammered nat .
" what business is it of yours , anyway ? "
he cried .
" it is a good deal of my business , " responded <name> sully , warmly .
" i am the <unk> for this district , and i wo n't allow you or anybody else to close off this road , or any other , without special permission .
you had no right to put those logs across the road away back , and put up that sign , and i want you to take 'em away as soon as you can . "
" well , my father bought this land , and   " " no , he did n't buy it ; the paper company bought it , " corrected <name> sully .
" but that gave 'em no right to close the road .
you take that stuff out of the way , and at once , or i 'll have you locked up . "
and walking around the barrier he caught nat by the arm .
" let go  do n't you touch me ! "
screamed the money-lender 's son , trying to jerk away .
" you let my friend alone , " broke in <name> jasniff , and made a motion as if to use his club .
" here , none of that  or i 'll have you all in the lock-up in jig time , " said the <unk> , so sternly that jasniff allowed the club to drop to his side .
he turned again to <name> and his friends .
" did you see these chaps put this stuff here ? "
" yes , " replied the others .
" then get to work and clear it away instantly , or i 'll lock you all up , and these fellows can testify against you , " continued the <unk> , to nat and his cronies .
" good !
that 's the way to talk to 'em ! "
cried <name> , in a low voice .
" i guess nat did n't expect to meet the <unk> , " returned <name> .
the money-lender 's son and his cronies tried to argue the matter , but <name> sully would not listen to them .
he knew <name> poole , and had no love for the man who had on more than one occasion <unk> a mortgage , and driven people out of house and home .
" i 'll give you ten minutes to clear the road , " he said , taking out a big silver watch .
" if it ai n't cleared by that time i 'll take you over to <unk> and lock you up . "
" i wo n't touch a stick ! "
cried jasniff , defiantly .
" nor i , " added merwell .
" oh , but  er  i do n't want to be locked up ! "
whined nat .
" you said your dad had a right to the road , " said jasniff , in disgust .
" i thought he did have , but  er  i guess i was mistaken .
oh , come on and help me ! "
pleaded nat , and set to work without further delay , to clear the road .
jasniff and merwell were very angry , but they did not care to let their crony do all the work , and they were a bit afraid of <name> sully , so presently they took hold and aided the money-lender 's son in clearing the highway .
" as soon as you 've finished here you 'll come back with me and clear the other spot , " said the <unk> .
" and you can tear up that sign , for it is no good . "
" i 'm going to put it up near the falls , " answered nat .
" nobody can come down there any more . "
" then you 'd better put up a fence to keep 'em out , " was the <unk> comment .
" you do n't want us to come back with you , do you ? "
asked <name> , in a whisper .
" we are off for a picnic and it is getting late . "
" no , you can go on if you want to , " answered <name> sully .
" i can manage them , i reckon .
if they give me any trouble i 'll put 'em in the lock-up and get you to testify to what they did on the road . "
" oh , <name> , let us go on ! "
cried <name> .
" i do n't want to stay here another minute . "
the others were all anxious to depart , and as soon as the road was entirely clear the two touring cars were started up .
" <name> you have a nice time clearing away that other stuff , " remarked <name> to nat poole and his cronies , as the machine passed on .
" do n't you crow ,  we are not done with you yet ! "
shouted merwell , and jasniff shook his fist at the departing cars .
nat poole felt so humiliated he turned his gaze in another direction .
" it was a lucky thing that that <unk> came along when he did , " remarked <name> , when the scene of the encounter had been left behind .
" if he had n't showed up i do n't know what we should have done . "
" maybe we would have had a fight , " returned <name> .
" oh , i am glad it did n't come to that ! "
cried <name> , and her face showed her relief .
" wonder what became of the racing car and <name> barnaby ? "
questioned the shipowner 's son .
" perhaps barnaby went ahead to make more trouble for us ! "
said <name> .
" we had better be on our guard , " he called to <name> .
" i 'll follow you at a safe distance , as i did before , " answered the senator 's son .
the falls were passed , and then they commenced to ascend a long hill , leading to lookout point .
just before the spot was reached they took to another side road , and were glad to see that no other automobile had passed that way .
" we 'll have the lookout all to ourselves , " said <name> .
" and that is just what we want . "
" maybe i 'm not getting hungry ! "
cried <name> .
" i really believe i could choke down a chicken sandwich , if i was forced to do it ! "
" <unk> ' is good ! "
answered <name> .
" girls , be sure to keep the hamper away from <name> , or he wo n't leave enough behind to feed a canary , " and this remark brought forth the first laugh since the trouble on the road .
they drove as close to lookout point as the road allowed , and then placed the two cars in a safe place under the trees .
" we must keep our eyes open , " whispered <name> to the other boys .
" that other crowd may sneak up and try to damage the machines , so as to make us walk from here . "
" we 'll watch out , " answered <name> ; and the others said the same .
while the boys started a campfire over which to boil some coffee , and obtained a bucket of fresh drinking water from a nearby spring , the girls spread a tablecloth over some flat rocks and set around the dishes and the things to eat .
there was more than enough of everything to go around , and it was particularly appetizing after that long ride in the fresh air .
" i tell you , this is something like , " cried <name> , munching on a sandwich and a stalk of celery .
" i should n't mind having a picnic like this once a week regularly . "
" make it twice a week , " returned <name> , who was eating a sandwich from one hand and a hard-boiled egg from the other .
" who 'll have some coffee ? "
cried <name> , coming up with a pot of the steaming beverage .
" i 've got to strain it through the corner of a napkin , but i guess that wo n't hurt it . "
" napkin , indeed ! "
cried <name> .
" there is a <unk> in the spout . "
" oh , is there ?
i did n't look in to see .
well , here goes !
coffee !
ten cents a cup , or two cups for a nickel !
good for the complexion and warranted to cure the blues ! "
cried the shipowner 's son gayly , and swung the pot around over his head .
" hi !
look out there ! "
roared <name> , clapping his hand to his ear .
" i like coffee , but i do n't drink it that way ! "
and he wiped off a few drops that had reached him .
" <name> is fined one horseshoe nail for spilling the coffee , " cried <name> .
" do n't nail me so soon ! "
answered the shipowner 's son gayly .
" shoo !
just to hear that ! "
murmured <name> .
" i 'm too hoarse to answer to that ! "
said <name> .
" say , do you know why a lawyer likes to drink coffee ? "
asked <name> .
" why ? "
asked the girls , in a chorus .
" because there is always a fee in it for him , " was the answer .
and then the joker had to dodge an <name> and a pickle that <name> and <name> hurled at him , while all the girls giggled .
an hour was spent over the lunch , the boys doing their best to entertain the girls and succeeding admirably .
of course a good many of the things that were said were silly , but everybody was in good humor and out for a good time , so what did it matter ?
in their high spirits they forgot all about the unfortunate occurrence of the morning .
after the lunch the boys helped the girls clean up and put away what was left , and then all strolled about , first to the edge of the lookout , to view the scenery , and then to the woods and the <name> beyond .
<name> naturally paired off with <name> , while <name> went with <name> , and <name> with <name> .
" well , it wo n't be long now before i 'll be off again for oak hall , " said <name> , as he and <name> stood where the <name> tumbled over a series of rocks , making a murmur pleasant to hear .
" yes , <name> , and i  i shall be sorry to have you go , " said <name> , looking him full in the eyes .
" you 'll write to me often , wo n't you , <name> ? "
he asked , in a lower voice .
" i 'll answer every letter you send , <name> , " and now she cast down her eyes for a moment .
" i always do . "
" i know it  and you ca n't imagine how much i treasure those letters , " he went on .
" well , i  i think a lot of your letters , too , " she whispered .
" then you want me to write very often ? "
" yes . "
" all right , i <name> .
and , <name>   " continued <name> , but just then a shout from <name> interrupted him .
chapter v the boys and a bull " wonder what <name> wants ? "
said <name> , as the shouting continued .
" i guess i 'll have to go and see . "
he ran over the rocks in the direction of the cries , and soon came in sight of his chum .
" hurry up ! "
cried <name> .
" i want you ! "
" what is it , <name> ? "
questioned <name> .
" we are going to have trouble . "
" what , have jasniff and those others come here ? "
" no , but maybe it 's just as bad , <name> .
just look toward the autos . "
<name> did as requested , and his face became a study .
he was half inclined to laugh , yet , having been brought up in the country , he well knew the seriousness of the situation .
the two automobiles stood side by side , about three yards apart .
between them was a big and <unk> bull , tramping the ground and snorting viciously .
the bull had a chain around his neck , and to the end of this was a <unk> tree stump , which the animal had evidently pulled from the ground in his endeavor to get away from his pasture .
the tree stump had become entangled in the wheel of one of the automobiles , and the bull was giving vicious jerks , first one way and then another , causing the machine to " slew around " in an alarming fashion .
" <name> , we 'll have to get him out of there ! "
cried <name> .
" if we do n't he may break that wheel  or do worse . "
" i 'm afraid he 'll run off with the car ! "
gasped <name> .
he was almost out of breath from running and calling .
by this time the others were coming up .
at the sight of the savage bull several of the girls commenced to scream .
" oh , we 'll be killed ! "
" ca n't somebody drive him away ! "
" look !
look !
he is dragging one machine into the other ! "
" you girls had better keep back , " warned <name> .
" if he breaks loose he may come for you . "
" oh , <name> , do be careful ! "
cried <name> .
" yes , yes , do n't go too close , " added his sister .
" what do you suppose we can do ? "
questioned the senator 's son , as the boys gathered in a group at a little distance , and the girls got behind them .
" if i had a hooked pole i 'd soon fix him , " answered <name> .
" how ? "
asked <name> , who knew little or nothing about bulls .
" see that ring in his nose ?
i 'd hook him in that and then keep him at the end of the pole .
that always brings 'em to terms . "
" but we have n't got any hook , " said <name> .
" we might make one , though , " he added .
a small hatchet had been brought along  with which to chop firewood  and securing this the boys quickly cut two slender but strong saplings , and trimmed them of their branches .
" there is a hook in our car , " said <name> .
" if you could only get that ! "
" do n't you try it , " said <name> .
" i 've known a bull to leap into a wagon , and this one might leap right into the auto and wreck everything  and hurt you in the bargain . "
" i 'll use a tree root for a hook , " said <name> , and quickly found what he wanted , and bound it fast to one of the poles by means of a fishing line he happened to be carrying .
" now , <name> , you stand by to prod him , if he gets too <unk> , " went on <name> , as he handed the second pole to his chum .
" all right , " answered <name> .
he , too , had been brought up on a farm , and knew a little about bulls .
the animal had quieted down for a moment , and was grazing on some grass between the automobiles .
but , as the lads approached , he raised his head , pawed with his hoof , and gave a vicious snort .
" he means to fight , <name> ! "
cried <name> .
" we 've got to be on our guard . "
" oh , do be careful ! "
cried <name> .
to her this beast of the farm looked more terrifying than those she had seen on the ranch .
with great caution <name> approached the bull from one side while <name> approached from the other .
the animal snorted again , and lowered his horns .
all the girls began to scream .
" better be quiet , " called out <name> .
" you 'll only excite him more . "
" oh , be careful ! "
answered <name> , in a horrified whisper .
at that moment the bull backed up against one of the automobiles , and then moved forward again .
this action released the tree stump , so that the beast was now free to go where he pleased .
he started straight for <name> .
" prod him ! "
yelled <name> , and <name> promptly did as requested , catching the bull in the mouth with his stick .
then , as the animal turned aside , <name> jumped closer , put out his stick , and caught the improvised hook in the nose ring .
" good !
you 've got him ! "
shouted <name> .
" can we help you any ? "
" i do n't think so  keep quiet , " was the reply .
the bull snorted wildly for a moment , and <name> had all he could do to keep the animal at the pole 's length .
but he knew how to twist the ring , and this speedily brought the beast to terms .
the snorting ceased , and the bull stood still , glaring viciously at his <unk> , but not daring to attempt an attack .
" come , gee <unk> ! "
cried <name> , presently ; and with caution commenced to pull on the pole .
slowly the bull stepped after him , dragging the chain and stump behind him .
" what are you going to do with him ? "
called out <name> .
" tangle him up in the bushes  if i can , " was the answer , and <name> turned in the direction of the brushwood lining the watercourse .
at this point there were a good many sharp rocks and twisted roots of bushes and trees , and it was not long before the loose stump caught on them .
" come on , we 'll fasten him good and hard ! "
cried <name> , dashing up behind the bull , and as quickly as it could be done he and the others piled some loose rocks against the tree stump , so that it would be next to impossible for the bull to work it free .
" now you can let him go , <name> , " said <name> , who had stood guard with his pole .
" we 've got him as fast as he ever was . "
and then <name> let loose from the ring , much to the animal 's relief , for he chanced to have a tender nose , and the twisting of the ring hurt him a good deal .
" are you sure he wo n't get away and come for us ? "
questioned <name> , as all <name> to a safe distance .
" he wo n't get away very soon , " answered <name> .
" but we ought to notify his owner of what we have done . "
" whose bull is it ? "
asked one of the girls .
" i give up  i never saw him before . "
" i think the bull belongs to the hook stock farm , " said <name> , mentioning a farm located about a mile away .
" i do n't know of anybody else around here who would own a bull .
when we go home we can stop at the farm and tell them of what has happened . "
leaving the animal quietly grazing among the bushes , the boys and girls walked over to the automobiles , to learn if any damage had been done .
in his movements the bull had scratched some paint from the wheels and the <unk> , but that was all , for which they were thankful .
" well , it 's about time to start for home , " said <name> , consulting his watch .
" remember , we are to go the long way around ,  and stop at the hook place in the bargain . "
" i 'm ready to go , " answered <name> .
the presence of the bull still disturbed her .
yet it was some little time before they started , for the things had to be packed , and several of the boys and girls wanted to get photographs of the picnic party .
then <name> <unk> up , and <name> did the same .
all piled in , and the start for home was begun .
" i 'll wager that nat poole , link merwell , and <name> jasniff are the maddest boys in this state , " was <name> 's comment , as the first car rolled on , with he and <name> on the front seat .
" i believe you , <name> , " answered the driver of the machine .
" and if jasniff and merwell really do go to rockville academy you can make up your mind that they <name> cause us all the trouble possible . "
" i do n't believe the better class of fellows at the military academy <name> take to those chaps . "
" neither do i .
but there are some mean boys at that school  you remember them  and merwell and jasniff <name> flock with that bunch .
oh , they'll try their best to down us , you see if they do n't ! "
declared <name> .
on the road beyond the picnic ground they came to a spot where some rocks and logs had been piled up and then taken away again .
all gazed at the spot with interest .
" i guess <name> barnaby did this  under directions from nat poole , " said <name> .
" yes , and <name> sully made him , or the poole crowd , clear it away again , " answered <name> .
" they 'll not close this road as long as sully is <unk> . "
" be on your guard , <name> ! "
sang out <name> .
" those rascals <name> play some trick on us , if they can . "
" i 'm on the watch ! "
answered <name> .
as they bowled along all kept their eyes on the alert , and it was well that they did so , for at a turn they suddenly came upon some broken bottles thrown down just where the machines had to pass .
<name> gave a yell of warning , and turned off the power and applied the brakes just in time , and , as before , <name> had to turn into the bushes , to avoid striking the turnout ahead .
" they thought they 'd make us cut our tires , " said <name> .
" right you are , " answered <name> .
" phew !
if we had gone over that glass we might have had some nasty <unk> or <unk> . "
" they ought to be arrested for this ! "
said <name> , wrathfully .
" it's against the law to put glass on a public highway . "
" we ca n't prove they did it , " answered <name> .
" if we accused them , of course they would deny it .
but it shows their meanness . "
the boys got out and picked up some of the glass , and swept the rest aside as well as they could .
then the machines were started up once more , and soon they came in sight of the hook stock farm , and <name> beckoned to a man who stood near the gateway .
" have you lost one of your bulls ? "
he asked .
" we sure have ! "
answered the man , quickly .
" what do you know about him ? "
" we know he tried to run off with our autos , " returned <name> , with a grin , and then told the man the story , and described where the animal could be found .
while he was speaking two other stock farm hands came up .
they had been looking for the bull since early morning .
" he 's a valuable beast , " said one of the men .
" i <name> he ai n't hurt none . "
" he is n't hurt  and we are mighty glad he did n't hurt us , " said <name> .
" oh , he wo n't hurt nobody  if he 's left alone , " said the man .
" how can he hurt anybody , if he is left alone ? "
was <name> 's dry query .
but the man was too dull to see the joke .
from the stock farm hands , the boys found out which were the best roads to take , and then passed on again , up hill and down <name> for a distance of six miles , when they came out on a broad and well-kept highway .
" good !
this is what i like ! "
cried <name> , and turned on the power until the touring car was moving along at a lively rate .
<name> " hit her up , " as he called it , also , and before long they had covered an additional ten miles .
then they had to go over a hill , beyond which lay the village of <name> .
" let us stop at <name> for some ice-cream soda , " whispered <name> to <name> , and the latter agreed .
at the foot of the hill there was a turn , and <name> slowed up to make this , and <name> did likewise .
then , as they passed a deep and muddy ditch , <name> gave a cry and came to a stop .
" look there ! "
he called out , pointing down into the ditch .
all gazed to where he pointed .
there , in the water and mud , rested the racing car belonging to <name> barnaby .
and standing in the mud up to his knees was the <unk> man himself , looking the picture of <unk> despair .
chapter <name> a talk with <name> poole as the boys halted their touring cars and gazed at the racing car and its owner , they could not help but smile , and <name> laughed outright .
" how did it happen ? "
asked <name> , in as kindly a tone as he could assume , for he saw that <name> barnaby was in serious trouble .
the turnout had landed in a particularly soft spot , and was settling deeper and deeper every minute .
" none of your business ! "
growled the <unk> man , wrathfully .
" oh , all right ! "
returned <name> , coldly .
" i thought maybe you would want us to help you . "
" precious little help i 'd get from you chaps ! "
grumbled <name> barnaby .
" you might get some if you would act half civil , " answered <name> .
" humph !
i suppose you want me to ask you to help me , so that you can have the pleasure of refusing me , eh ? "
" no , if i can aid you i <name> , " answered <name> , promptly .
" he does n't deserve any help , " whispered <name> .
" i know that , <name> , " answered <name> .
" but i 'd hate to leave him in the lurch .
why , that machine may sink so deep nobody could get it out . "
" if you 'll haul me out i 'll pay you for your trouble , " said <name> barnaby , gruffly .
" it 's an easy way to earn ten dollars . "
" i do n't want your money , " replied <name> .
" i 'll do what i can . "
" so <name> i , " added <name> .
" the two machines together ought to be able to do the trick . "
" do you really mean it ? "
asked the <unk> man , and now his voice had a ring of <name> in it .
" yes , " said the senator 's son , and <name> nodded .
the boys got out , and from the three cars ropes were produced and tied together , and the two touring cars were hooked one in front of the other , and then made fast to the racing car .
" do n't haul too hard at the start , " begged <name> barnaby .
" if you do you may pull my car apart . "
" we 'll be careful , " answered <name> .
he turned to his chum .
" remember , <name> , we 've got eighty <unk> hooked up here . "
" i 'll be on my guard , " answered the senator 's son .
" but remember , " he added to <name> barnaby , " we are not to be responsible if the hauling breaks your car . "
" i 'll run that risk  only go slow , " answered the man in trouble .
the rope had been made as long as possible , so that the <unk> car could be drawn out of the ditch <unk> instead of sidewise .
the two cars in the road started up on low speed , and gradually the rope grew taut .
" look out , everybody , in case that rope <unk> ! "
cried <name> .
" i once heard of a rope like that snapping and killing a <unk> . "
" you are cheerful , i must say , " was <name> 's dry comment .
nevertheless , all were on their guard as the rope grew as tight as a string on a bow .
" she ai n't moving yet ! "
cried <name> barnaby .
he stood by the side of his machine watching the rope closely .
hardly had he spoken when there came a slow , sucking sound , as the wheels left their bed of soft mud .
then the racing machine moved forward slowly .
" hurrah !
she 's coming ! "
cried <name> .
" put on a little more steam and you 'll have her ! "
<name> and <name> turned on more power , and the racing machine continued to move .
soon it was at the edge of the ditch , and then , with something of a jerk , it came up on the roadway , leaving a trail of dirty water and slimy mud behind it .
" say , you did it all right enough ! "
cried <name> barnaby , in delight .
" i was afraid she was too deep down to budge . "
" she would have been too deep if you had left her there very much longer , " answered <name> .
" now , if you 'll untie those ropes and clean them off for us , we 'll be on our way again . "
" sure , i 'll clean them off . "
and the <unk> man set to work with alacrity .
" say , do n't you really want me to pay you for this ? "
and he made a move as if to draw a roll of bills from his pocket .
" i do n't want a cent , " answered <name> .
" it 's all right , " added <name> ; " only , mr. barnaby , i 'd advise you after this not to stand in with nat poole and his crowd . "
" i 'm sorry i did , now ; honest i am , " was the <unk> man 's answer .
" i  er  i only did it as a favor for nat , because his father is holding one of my notes .
how did you make out after i went away ?
i see you must have got through . "
" we did , " replied <name> , and then mentioned how <name> sully had come to their aid .
at this news <name> barnaby began to grin .
" it was sure a neat way of turning the trick , " he said , " and seeing how you young gentlemen have helped me , i 'm glad you did it .
you can be sure i 'll never lay a straw in your way again , never ! "
and then , the ropes having been put away , the two touring cars proceeded on their way once more , leaving <name> barnaby to clean up his machine and put it in running order again .
" <name> , that was a real nice thing to do ! "
declared <name> , and gave him a bright look .
" he must have felt awfully small , for you to be so generous after the way he acted , " was <name> 's comment .
" maybe it <name> be a lesson to him , to do what is square in the future , " said <name> .
they were soon in the town of <name> , and there stopped at the main drug store , where the boys treated the girls to ice-cream " <unk> , " as they are sometimes called .
then they took a <unk> way back to crumville , arriving there at sundown .
" oh , what a nice day we have had , in spite of the drawbacks ! "
cried <name> , dancing into the mansion .
" drawbacks ? "
queried her mother .
" did you get a <unk> , or a breakdown ? "
" oh , no ; nothing happened to the cars , " answered the <unk> miss .
and then she turned to the boys , to let them tell the story .
while they were doing this , mr. wadsworth came in , followed by <name> 's father and his uncle , and caspar potts .
" that is just on a par with <name> poole 's actions in general , " said mr. wadsworth .
" he would claim the earth , if he dared .
i think the other property owners along that road <name> have something to say if he tries to close it up . "
" i heard about the new paper company this morning , " said <name> 's father .
" some of the stockholders are not in sympathy with the way mr. poole is managing affairs , and they talk of putting him out . "
" i <name> they do put him out ! "
cried <name> .
" he tries to <name> things with too high a hand altogether . "
" i am glad people are finding out what sort of folks the <unk> are , " said caspar potts .
he had not forgotten how in the past <name> poole had driven him to the wall , and tried to get his little farm away from him .
after the automobile outing , <name> , <name> , and <name> left crumville to pay their folks a brief visit before departing for oak hall .
this left <name> and <name> to get ready by themselves , and to take out the girls , which they did on several occasions .
they thought they might meet <name> jasniff and link merwell , but did not do so , and later on heard that the pair had departed for rockville military academy .
they saw nat poole , but he kept out of speaking distance .
" i wish nat was going to rockville , too , " said <name> .
" he 'd never be missed at oak hall . "
" oh , i would n't say that , <name> , " returned <name> .
" nat spends considerable money  although how he gets it from that miserly father of his i don't know  and that makes him some friends .
but i , too , wish he was n't going back to our school . "
" do you suppose he 'll take the same train we take ? "
" perhaps , although i <name> not . "
on the day before departing for oak hall , <name> and <name> went down to the railroad station to purchase their tickets .
there they saw nat , with a new dress-suit case and a new fall overcoat , talking to his father .
" he must be going to take the train this afternoon , " said <name> , and he was right .
when the train came in nat got aboard , along with a number of other passengers .
as he did this , he espied the others , and spoke a few words to his father in a whisper .
then the train rolled away , and <name> poole strode over to where <name> and <name> were standing .
" see here , young man , i want to talk to you ! "
cried the money-lender , gazing sourly at <name> .
" what do you want , mr .
poole ? "
asked <name> , as calmly as he could .
" you tried your best to get my son into trouble the other day . "
" no , i did n't  nat got himself into trouble . "
" bah !
you need n't try to tell me !
i know all about it . "
" i do n't care to discuss the question , " went on <name> , a trifle sharply .
" nat was to blame  if you do n't believe it , ask mr. sully , the <unk> , " put in <name> .
" do n't you try to tell me ! "
fumed <name> poole .
" i know both of you boys only too well !
you did your best to get my son and his friends into trouble .
now , i want to warn you about something .
i understand both of you are going back to oak hall .
nat is going there , too , and i give you fair warning that you must treat him fairly .
if you do n't i 'll come to the school and have it out with doctor <name> , understand that ? "
and the money-lender shook his long finger into the faces of the boys .
" mr. poole , just let me tell you something , " answered <name> .
" it is something you ought to know , and i feel it is my duty to tell you , even though you are not treating us as you should .
come out of the crowd , please . "
" i do n't want to listen to your talk . "
" well , you had better ,  unless you want a lot of trouble later on . "
" what do you want ? "
and rather unwillingly the money-lender followed <name> and <name> to a secluded corner of the railroad station .
" i want to warn you about the company nat is keeping .
the two boys he is going with , <name> jasniff and link merwell , are bad characters .
you do n't have to take my word for it  write to doctor <name> and see what he says .
<name> jasniff ran away from school and he got hold of some money that did n't belong to him and used it .
link merwell got mixed up with some horse-thieves , on his father 's ranch out west , and his father had to foot the <name> to hush the matter up .
i feel it my duty to tell you this , so that you can warn nat .
that 's all . "
and <name> caught <name> by the arm and started to walk away .
" humph !
so that is your game , eh ?
trying to <unk> other <unk> characters ! "
sneered <name> poole .
" well , it wo n't work with me , for i know you too well , <name> <name> .
do n't i know where you came from  the crumville poorhouse ?
i guess i can trust my son to pick out the right kind of friends .
you are jealous of him , because those other boys won't go with the like of you !
do n't talk to me !
only   " and <name> poole raised his forefinger again .
" remember my warning , when you get to oak hall ! "
and then he strode away , his thin lips tightly drawn , and his sharp <name> held high in the air .
" well , would n't that make you groan ! "
was <name> 's comment , after the man had disappeared .
" <name> , you had your trouble for your pains . "
" i do n't care , <name>  i just felt i had to tell him .
it 's a shame to let nat cotton to fellows like jasniff and merwell .
they <name> drag him down as sure as fate . "
" i believe you there .
but if nat 's father wo n't listen  why , i 'd drop the matter .
besides , you must remember that those fellows are going to another school , situated quite some distance from oak hall .
nat won't see them , excepting on special occasions . "
" he can meet them whenever he goes to rockville  the town i mean  and jasniff and merwell <name> get him to drink and smoke , and maybe gamble , and worse .
nat is easily led at times . "
" yes , i know that . "
<name> <name> a long breath .
" well , let 's drop the subject , <name> .
we have our own battles to fight . "
and then the boys separated , each to finish the preparations for his departure .
chapter vii on the way to oak hall swiftly the hours rolled away until it was time for <name> to bid his family and his friends good-by and leave for oak hall .
the evening before his departure he took a walk with <name> , to the end of the wadsworth garden , but what was said between the pair was never known to anybody but themselves .
when they came back he was holding her hand , and both of them looked as if they understood each other perfectly and were correspondingly happy .
all of the girls , as well as <name> 's father , went to the depot to see him off , and there they met <name> and some of his folks .
then the train came in , and the youths climbed on board , dress-suit cases in hand .
the girls waved their handkerchiefs .
" have a good time ! "
cried <name> , gayly .
" take good care of yourself , <name> ! "
added <name> .
" do n't forget to write , " supplemented <name> .
" we 'll do everything you want us to do ! "
shouted <name> , with a smile , and then he and <name> waved their caps from the car window as the train rolled forward , and crumville was left behind .
" well , we are off at last , " observed <name> , as he and <name> settled back in the seat for the run to the junction , where they would have to change cars for oakdale , the town nearest to the school .
" and i am not sorry , are you ? "
" not at all , <name> .
when it comes time to go to oak hall i am always glad to go and meet the other fellows ; when the term is over i am equally glad to get home and see the folks .
it is like the seasons  at the end of the summer i am glad <name> is coming , and at the end of <name> i am just as pleased that summer is at hand . "
" it 's the change , i suppose . "
<name> stretched out and <name> his knees high up in front of him .
" my , but when you come to look at it , what changes have taken place at oak hall since we first went there !
do n't you remember what a bully <name> plum used to be , and how chip macklin used to toady to him !
now plum has reformed completely , and chip is as manly a little chap as any of 'em . "
" it 's a pity that nat poole ca n't take a leaf from <name> 's notebook and reform , too , " answered <name> .
" maybe he <name>  after he sees the error of his ways .
but , <name> , what of athletics this season ?
are you going in for them ? "
" i am  but not too strongly , <name> .
i want to get all the education i can . "
" want to get through and leave oak hall ? "
" i do n't want to be a schoolboy all my life .
i want to get out in the world and make something of myself . "
" what are you going to become after you leave school ? "
" i do n't know yet .
i was talking it over with father and my uncle , but i have n't reached any decision . "
at the junction the boys had to wait about half an hour for the train to oakdale .
<name> suggested that they walk over to a <name> store and have some soda water .
" may meet some of the other fellows there , " he added .
" the train from the other way came in quarter of an hour ago , and i saw a lot of dress-suit cases in the baggage room . "
as the two youths entered the <name> store a shout went up from three boys who were drinking soda .
" there are <name> <name> and <name> basswood ! "
" hello , <name> , old man ; how are you ? "
" my , look at <name> 's new suit !
it 's almost loud enough to talk ! "
" hello , fellows ! "
answered <name> , and striding forward he shook hands with the crowd , one after the other .
" got any of those mountain lions with you ? "
queried <name> beggs , a <unk> , fat lad .
" heard you brought down about a dozen while you were on the ranch . "
" yes , <name> , i 've got three in my trunk , " answered <name> , gayly .
" want me to let 'em loose ! "
" heard you did up link merwell , " said <name> watson , another lad , who was well liked because of his singing and playing abilities .
" i was glad to hear it . "
" so were all of us , " broke in the third boy , a tall , slim youth , <name> hamilton by name .
" but speaking of mountain lions puts me in mind of a story .
once three men   " " the same old shadow ! "
interrupted <name> , grabbing his hand and giving it a squeeze that made the story-teller of the school wince .
" shadow , i believe you 'd try to spin a yarn when you were proposing to your best girl . "
" that sure would be a yarn , " cried <name> , as he , too , shook hands .
" i have n't any best girl and you know it , " retorted shadow .
" but i say , " he continued , closing one eye tightly .
" how is miss <name> wadsworth , <name> ? "
" very well , " was the answer , and <name> turned a bit red .
" let us have something , " he added , hastily , to the clerk behind the soda fountain counter .
" what shall it be , <name> ? "
" make it a true love <unk> , " sang out <name> beggs , with a broad grin .
" but do n't forget to put some <name> in it , " added shadow hamilton .
" my love , how can i leave thee !
one parting hug i give thee !
and now when oak hall calls me , i go , <unk> <unk> me ! "
sang <name> watson , and put up his hands as if playing an imaginary guitar .
" say , does n't anybody want to hear that story about the mountain lions ? "
queried shadow , reproachfully .
<unk> was his hobby , and it had often been said by his friends that he would rather spin a yarn than eat .
" some other time , shadow , " answered <name> .
" we want to hear about <name> 's trip west , and about what he did to link merwell . "
" before i tell you about that , let me give you a piece of news , " said <name> .
and then he related how he and the others had met merwell and jasniff with nat poole , and how the two former youths were going to rockville military academy .
as he had anticipated , this created quite a sensation , and a lively discussion followed , which was kept up even after the crowd got aboard the train which would <name> them to oakdale .
" well , if rockville wants such fellows it can have 'em , " was <name> beggs 's comment .
" i , for one , am glad they are out of oak hall . "
" i know one fellow who <name> be glad they are gone , " said shadow .
" that is <name> plum . "
" yes , indeed , " answered <name> , for he well remembered what influence merwell and even jasniff had exercised over plum when the youth had found his appetite for liquor almost too strong for him .
of course <name> had to go over many of his western adventures , and the others listened with keen interest to all he had to tell .
when he mentioned the theft of the horses at the ranch , and how link merwell had been mixed up with the thieves , more than one shook his head .
" according to that , link and <name> are a team , " said <name> watson .
" <name> , you had better be on your guard .
they wo n't hesitate to play you some foul trick . "
oakdale , a small but prosperous town , was reached at last , and the schoolboys piled out of the train , along with a few other passengers .
" hello , there is <name> vane ! "
cried <name> , catching sight of a slender lad with a girlish face .
" how are you , <name> ? "
" oh , it 's <name> <name> ! "
answered <name> vane , in a low but pleased voice .
he held out his slender hand .
" i am delighted to see you back !
how tanned you are , and how <unk> ! "
" it was the mountain air did it , <name> .
by the way , is horsehair around ? "
he continued , with a glance beyond the depot platform .
" oh , yes !
here he comes now ! "
and as <name> spoke the big carryall of the school swung into view , with <name> <unk> , commonly called " horsehair , " on the driver 's seat .
the boys made a rush for the carryall , throwing their <unk> in the rack on top , and piling inside one over the other .
" horsehair , you 're looking fine ! "
" how 's the widow , horsehair ?
heard you were going to marry a widow with eight children . "
" nine children , <name> ,  do n't drop any of the family like that . "
" nothing like getting a ready-made family while you are at it , horsehair . "
" i heard the widow was a <unk> , horsehair .
is that right ? "
" if she 's that , horsehair , she 'll make you mind the children and wash dishes  better beware ! "
" oh , do n't worry about that .
horsehair is an expert at washing dishes , and at minding babies he once took first prize at a county fair ; didn't you , horsehair ? "
" say , you ! "
roared the carryall driver , his face as red as a beet .
" you quit your <unk> ' !
i ai n't gittin ' married to no widder , nor nobody else !
an ' i ai n't <unk> ' dishes an ' <unk> ' babies nuther !
such boys ! "
and with a crack of his whip he started up the turnout so suddenly that half the lads were pitched into the laps of the other half .
it was certainly a jolly crowd that rolled over the well-kept highway toward oak hall .
they knew that many hard lessons awaited them , and that , once school opened , discipline would be strict , but just now all were in high spirits .
to the tune of " auld <name> syne " <name> watson started up the school song , and the others joined in lustily : " oak hall we never shall forget , no matter where we roam , it is the very best of schools , to us it 's just like home !
then give three cheers , and let them ring throughout this world so wide , to let the people know that we elect to here abide ! "
" that 's the stuff ! "
cried <name> , <unk> .
" now , then , for the field cry , " and then came the oak hall cheer : " baseball !
football !
oak hall has the call !
<unk> !
boom !
bang !
whoop ! "
" i think we ought to display the school colors ! "
cried <name> .
" anybody got a flag ? "
" here is one , " answered <name> vane , from his seat in front , beside the driver .
" but i have n't got a stick for it . "
" never mind , shadow 's fishing <name> <name> do , " answered <name> .
" shadow , hand it over . "
" all right , but do n't break the <name> , " said shadow .
" it cost me four bones . "
the <name> was put together , and the school colors fastened to the top .
then the <name> was thrust out of a side window of the carryall and waved in the air , first by one student and then another .
" look out , that you do n't hit nobody with that <unk> ' pole ! "
warned the carryall driver , as the turnout swung around a bend of the road .
he had scarcely spoken when a buggy came into view , driven by a tall , <unk> individual , wearing a high silk hat .
the buggy swung forward quickly , directly in line with the fishing <name> , and before the boys could haul the colors in the <name> hit the silk hat , sending it whirling into the bushes beside the roadway .
chapter viii about some new students " hi !
hi !
what 's the meaning of this outrage ! "
roared the individual in the buggy , as he brought his horse to a standstill .
" do you want to kill me ? "
" who is it ?
is he hurt ? "
questioned <name> , quickly .
" i do n't know , " answered <name> .
" the <name> took off his hat , but whether it struck his head or not remains to be seen . "
" wot 's the trouble back there ? "
demanded <name> <unk> , as he succeeded in bringing his team to a halt .
" trouble is , we hit that man with the <name> , " answered <name> .
" humph !
i told you to be careful , " grumbled the carryall driver .
" it do n't pay to act like a <unk> o ' wildcats , nohow ! "
" it 's too bad it happened , " said <name> , and leaped to the ground and ran back to where the buggy stood , with the driver glaring at them savagely .
the other students followed .
" are you hurt ? "
asked <name> , anxiously .
the man in the buggy was a total stranger to him .
" hurt ?
i do n't know whether i am or not .
what do you mean by knocking off my hat with that stick ? "
" it was an accident , sir .
we had our school colors on the fishing <name> and were waving them in the air .
we did n't expect to hit anybody . "
" bah !
you are a lot of rowdies ! "
growled the man .
" give me my hat ! "
and he pointed to where the head covering rested on some bushes .
" there you are , " said <name> , restoring the hat to its owner .
" but we are not rowdies  it was purely an accident , " he added , with a little flash out of his clear eyes .
" bah , i know schoolboys !
they think it smart to be tough ! "
the man looked his silk hat over .
" i ought to make you buy me a new hat . "
" that does n't seem to be damaged any , " said <name> , as he looked the tile over .
" if it is , of course we 'll make it right , " he added , hastily .
he and <name> were holding the fishing <name> at the time of the accident .
" do you boys belong at oak hall ? "
demanded the man , smoothing down the <unk> silk hat with his forearm .
" yes , " answered <name> .
" i thought so .
well , if this hat is cracked or anything like that i'll notify the master of the school , and make you get me a new hat .
maybe it <name> be a lesson to you , to be more careful . "
" let me see the hat , please , " said <name> .
" what for ? "
" i wish to see if it is really damaged . "
" if it is , i 'll let you know quick enough , do n't fear . "
" i want to see it now .
i am not going to pay for a new hat if this one is all right . "
" <name> !
so you do n't want to take my word for it , eh ? "
roared the man .
" i want to look the hat over , " answered <name> , stubbornly .
" so do i , " added <name> .
" i 'll not give you the hat  to play more tricks with .
i shall take it to a hat dealer , and if he says it is injured , i 'll call at the school about it . "
and having thus delivered himself the man in the buggy put the silk hat on his head , spoke to his horse , and whirled on down the road in the direction of rockville .
" talk about a <unk> individual ! "
cried <name> .
" he certainly is one . "
" i do n't think the hat was damaged at all , " said <name> .
" it <name> simply be a <unk>  if he tries to get a new one out of us .
that hat is quite old and <unk> . "
" he was a <unk> fellow all the way through , " commented <name> .
" wonder who he is ? "
" he 's some kind of a doctor , " answered the carryall driver , who had left his turnout to join the boys .
" he came to oakdale and rockville this summer , and he gives lectures on how to git well and strong , an ' then he sells medicine .
i know a feller got a bottle from him , but it did n't do him no good .
he calls himself doctor montgomery ,  but i reckon he ain't no real doctor at all . "
" must be one of these <unk> who go around the country trying to rope people in , " said <name> .
" if he is , he ought to be run out of the neighborhood . "
" maybe we 'll never hear from him again , " said <name> .
but the boys were destined to hear from hooker montgomery again , and in a manner to surprise them .
returning to the carryall , the boys took in the colors , so that they might do no further damage , and then the journey to oak hall was resumed .
the encounter on the road had sobered them a little , and this did not wear away until they came in sight of the school buildings .
" hurrah !
i see <name> and <name> ! "
cried <name> , as the carryall swung in between the large oak trees that gave the place its name .
" hello ! "
he shouted .
" here we are again ! "
" <name> ! "
returned the senator 's son , running forward , while <name> did the same .
" how are you all ? "
he added , waving his hand to the crowd in general .
a number of other boys were present , and soon <name> was surrounded by his old friends , all eager to shake hands .
they wanted to know all about his trip , and he in return wanted to know what they had been doing .
so there was a perfect babble of voices as the crowd walked into the main school building , where good old doctor <unk> <name> , the head of the institution , stood to welcome each new arrival .
" glad to see you back , <name> , " he said , kindly .
" and i must thank you in person for the skin you sent from the ranch .
we have placed it on the floor of the reception room .
i am quite proud to think one of my pupils is such a good shot . "
" <name> and <name> are good shots , too , " answered <name> , anxious that his chums should have all the credit due them .
" so i understand . "
doctor <name> paused for a moment .
" i believe you met <name> merwell out west . "
he eyed <name> curiously as he mentioned the fact .
" yes , i met him  and we had some trouble  but it is all over now .
but , doctor <name>   " <name> motioned the master of the school to one side and lowered his voice .
" do you know that merwell and <name> jasniff are going to rockville military academy ? "
" is it possible ! "
" that is what they say .
it seems to me that the authorities of rockville ought to know what sort they are . "
" that is true , <name> , but  ahem !  i do n't know what i can do .
you see , to tell you the truth , the management of the military academy has changed hands , and the new master and i are not on speaking terms .
he wished to obtain certain pupils , and they came to this school instead , and that made him very angry .
he claimed that i treated him unfairly , but i did not .
even if i were to warn him against jasniff and merwell it is not likely that he would take the warning in good part .
besides , the military academy is not in a prosperous condition financially , and i rather think the owners <name> take almost any pupils they can get . "
" i see , sir .
well , if that 's the case , why we might as well drop the matter , " answered <name> .
" i <name> think it over , and perhaps i 'll send a letter to the master of rockville , " returned doctor <name> , seriously .
" i do n't want even an enemy to harbor such lads as jasniff and merwell without knowing what they are , although it would be to rockville 's credit if it took those boys and made real men out of them . "
as my old readers know , oak hall was a large building of brick and stone , shaped in the form of a cross , with the classrooms , the private office , the dining-room , and the kitchen on the ground floor .
on the second floor were the majority of the school dormitories , furnished to accommodate from four to eight pupils each .
the school was surrounded by a broad campus , sloping in the rear to the <unk> river , on the bank of which was located the school boathouse .
at one side of the campus was a neat gymnasium , and at the other were some stables and sheds , and also a <unk> garage for automobiles and <unk> .
<name> and his chums had their quarters in dormitories nos .
11 and 12 , two large and <unk> apartments , having a connecting door between .
not far away was dormitory no .
13 , occupied by nat poole and his cronies .
merwell and jasniff had had beds in that room , but now those places were given to others .
<name> and <name> had arrived the day before , and were already settled , and now they did what they could to make <name> at home , assisting him in <unk> his trunk and his suit-case , and putting the things away in the bureau and the clothes closet .
of course <name> had brought along some pictures and banners , and these were <name> up or set on the bureau  that is , all but one photograph  one of <name> she had given him the day before .
that he kept to himself , in his private drawer with a few other treasures , under lock and key .
" hello , <name> ; can i help you ? "
came a voice from the doorway , and <name> plum appeared .
the former bully of the hall was a trifle thin and pale , but his eyes were clear and his voice pleasant to hear .
" why , <name> , how are you ! "
cried <name> , and shook hands warmly .
" did you have a good time this summer ? "
" quite good , " answered plum .
" you know i went up to maine with mr. <name> .
he took up half a dozen fellows , and we went in for botany and geology while we were camping out . "
" well , i guess mr. <name> is good company , " answered <name> .
he referred to <name> <name> , the first assistant teacher of the school , a man well beloved by nearly all the students .
every summer this teacher took out some of the boys , and there was always a rivalry as to who should go along .
" it was better than just  er  knocking around , " stammered <name> plum .
he meant carousing around with fellows of the merwell and jasniff sort , and <name> understood .
he hesitated for a moment and looked around , to see if anybody but <name> and <name> were in the rooms .
" of course , you know nat poole is back , " he continued , in a low voice .
" yes ,  i saw him leave crumville . "
" <name> , you want to beware of him . "
<name> plum uttered the words very earnestly .
" oh , i am not afraid of nat  never was . "
" yes , but this is different , <name> .
i suppose you know there are a lot of new fellows at oak hall this year . "
" there are new fellows every year  the seniors go and the <unk> come in . "
" yes , but this year we have more new fellows than ever .
a school in <unk> broke up , and sixteen of the students were transferred to oak hall  sophs , juniors , and seniors .
so those fellows , added to the <unk> , make quite a bunch . "
" what has that got to do with poole and me ? "
" nat poole and one of the fellows from <unk> , a chap named <name> frapley , are very good friends  in fact , i think they are related .
this frapley was a sort of leader at <unk> , and he has got a number of the other newcomers under his thumb .
last night i was down by the boathouse , and i heard nat and frapley talking about you .
nat was very anxious to do something to 'make you take a back seat , ' as he termed it , and after a while frapley consented to take the matter up with him . "
" what do you suppose they 'll do ? "
questioned <name> , who had listened to plum 's words with interest .
" i do n't know exactly , but they 'll do something , you can be sure of that .
more than likely it <name> be something underhanded . "
" i am not afraid of nat poole  nor of this <name> frapley , either , " said <name> .
" <name> has so many friends here , why should he be afraid ? "
asked <name> .
" well , i only thought i 'd warn you , that 's all , " answered the former bully , meekly .
" i do n't want <name> to have any more trouble if i can help it . "
" it 's kind of you , <name> , to tell me of this , " answered <name> , heartily .
" and i 'll be on my guard .
but i really do n't think nat poole <name> cut much of a figure during this term of school .
he has lost too many of his old friends . "
but , for once , <name> was mistaken .
nat poole did " cut a figure , " although not quite in the manner expected , and what he and his cronies did caused <name> not a little trouble .
chapter ix the football meeting in a few days <name> felt as much at home as ever .
nearly all of his old friends had returned to oak hall , and dormitories nos .
11 and 12 were filled with as bright a crowd of lads as could well be found anywhere .
in the number were <name> plum and chip macklin , but the former was no longer the bully as of old , and the latter had lost his <unk> manner , and was quite manly , and the other students treated them as if all had always been the best of friends .
it did <name> 's heart good to see the change in plum , and he was likewise pleased over the different way in which macklin acted .
" i never thought it was in <name> and chip , " he said , privately , to <name> .
" it shows what a fellow can do if he sets his mind to it . "
" it 's to your credit as much as to their own , " declared the senator's son .
" i do n't believe <name> would have reformed if you had n't braced him up . "
" i wish i could reform nat poole . "
" you 'll never do it , <name>  but you may scare him into behaving himself . "
" have you met <name> frapley , <name>  i mean to talk to ? "
" yes , in the <unk> , where <name> and i were practicing with the indian clubs . "
" what do you think of him ? "
" i think he is fairly aching to become the leader of the school .
he was leader at <unk> , and it breaks his heart to play second fiddle to anybody here .
he and nat are as thick as two peas .
they tell me he is a great football player , so i suppose he <name> try to run the eleven  if the fellows <name> let him . "
" i do n't think the old players <name> let a new crowd run our team . "
" the trouble is , some of the old players are gone , and the new crowd may count up the largest number of votes .
in that case they 'll be able to run things to suit themselves . "
<name> had settled down to his studies in <name> , for that <name> he wished to make an extra good record for himself .
he loved sports , but as he grew older he realized that he was at oak hall more for a mental than a physical training .
" when my time comes , i shall have a good many business interests to look after , " was the way he expressed himself to <name> , who joked him about " <unk> like a cart horse , " " and i know if i have n't the education i'll be at the <name> of anybody who wishes to take advantage of my ignorance . "
" well , you are not going to give up football , are you , <name> ? "
questioned the shipowner 's son .
" not if they want me on the eleven . "
" well , that depends .
we have a meeting monday afternoon , in the gym . "
<name> had noticed a good many whispered conversations taking place between some of the old students and all of the new ones , and he had wondered what was going on .
a hint was dropped that the football meeting would " wake things up , " whatever that might mean .
" i think i know what is in the wind , " said <name> plum to <name> during a recess on monday .
" nat poole and <name> frapley came to me last night and they wanted me to pledge myself to support frapley for captain of the eleven . "
" well , they had a right to do that , <name> . "
" i told them i would n't do it .
they said if i did n't i 'd get left .
i told 'em that would n't hurt me very much , because i did n't care for playing anyway . "
" i see , " answered <name> , thoughtfully .
he at once sought out <name> , <name> , and <name> day ,  those who had loved to play football in the past , and who had hoped to be on the eleven the present season  and talked the matter over with them .
then the shipowner 's son made a quiet canvass among all those interested in football .
" plum is right , " he declared later .
" frapley , aided by nat poole and his cronies , is going to <name> matters with a high hand . "
" it 's an outrage ! "
cried <name> .
" a stranger running the oak hall eleven !
i shall protest ! "
" it wo n't do any good  if frapley gets the votes , " answered <name> .
" especially if he is a good player , and they say he is . "
the news that there was going to be a lively time <name> a large crowd to the meeting in the gymnasium .
this was called to order by the former manager of the eleven , and a call was issued for <unk> for a new manager .
" i nominate <name> rand ! "
cried nat poole , mentioning one of the students from <unk> .
" second the nomination ! "
added <name> frapley , promptly .
" i nominate <name> fordham , " said <name> , putting up one of the old students , who did not play , but who was a good general manager , and a youth well liked by his classmates .
<name> seconded <name> 's nomination , and as there were no other names submitted , the <unk> were declared closed .
" mr. chairman , i 'd like to say a few words before we hold an election  i mean , before we vote , " said <name> day , mounting a chair .
" oh , dry up , and let us cast our ballots ! "
muttered nat poole .
" i wish to speak in favor of <name> fordham , whom all old students of oak hall know so well , " continued <name> .
" he knows   " " vote !
vote !
let us vote ! "
called out several new students loudly , and it was seen that they were urged on by <name> frapley .
in a moment half a dozen students were speaking at once , and it took several minutes for the chairman of the meeting to restore silence .
then <name> was allowed to make a short speech and he was followed by <name> , both speaking in favor of fordham .
then a new student spoke in favor of rand , and then the voting began .
the result was a painful surprise for fordham , and equally painful to <name> and his chums .
so well had nat poole , <name> frapley , and their cohorts laid their plans that <name> rand was elected manager of the coming eleven by a majority of five votes .
" it is all up with our crowd ! "
murmured <name> to <name> , when the result was announced .
" that crowd has got votes enough to ride over us <unk> , and it is going to do it . "
and the senator 's son was right , as later events speedily proved .
the new football team , made up of a regular eleven and five substitutes , counted but six old oak hall players .
<name> , <name> , <name> , and their close chums were utterly ignored .
<name> frapley was chosen captain and <unk> , and nat poole was made <unk> .
it is needless to say that some of the old players , who had worked so hard in the past to make oak hall victorious , left the meeting in disgust .
" this is the worst i was ever up against ! "
murmured <name> .
" talk about ingratitude !
and just think that once <name> nearly lost his life to help us win ! "
" and think of how hard <name> and you worked , " put in a <unk> .
" it's a burning shame , that 's what it is . "
" well , there is one satisfaction , " said <name> , as calmly as he could , although he was as depressed as any one .
" it is on their shoulders now to make good .
we have n't anything on that score to worry about . "
" i 'll tell you what let 's do ! "
cried <name> .
" we 'll organize a scrub eleven , and wax 'em out of their shoes ! "
" i do n't believe they 'll play you  they are afraid , " said <name> .
" never mind , then we 'll play somebody else .
we can challenge them , anyway .
if they are afraid of us we want the whole school to know it . "
<name> 's idea met with considerable favor , and he easily persuaded <name> , <name> , <name> , <name> plum , and a number of others to join his scrub eleven , which was named the old guard .
<name> was manager as well as captain , and played right <unk> , while <name> was <unk> , and <name> was center .
the eleven went into practice with as much vigor as if they were training for some championship games .
as had been anticipated , the regular eleven tried to ignore the old guard .
when a challenge to play was issued , <name> rand sent back word that he could fix up his own scrub eleven without any help from outsiders .
his scrub was made up of freshmen and , of course , the regular team beat them with ease .
" never mind  they are afraid of us  and we 'll let everybody know it , " declared <name> .
and then the challenge from the old guard to the regular eleven was posted up in the gymnasium , where all might see it .
it was torn down over night , but a new copy was put up by the following noon .
as was to be expected , the challenge created much talk , and <name> and frapley almost came to blows about it .
<name> and his chums were accused of trying to break up the good feeling of the school in general , and , in return , the shipowner 's son very bluntly told the new captain of the school eleven that he would lead oak hall to defeat .
" it 's time enough to talk like that after we are beaten , " declared <name> frapley , grimly .
then it was announced that the regular oak hall football eleven would play the opening game of the season against an eleven from lemington on a saturday afternoon , the contest to take place on the lemington athletic grounds .
" they ought to be waxed good and proper ! "
said chip macklin .
" who ? "
asked <name> .
" our eleven , <name> .
oh , i know what you <name> say  that that is n't the true school spirit and all that  but just the same , poole and frapley and that bunch do n't deserve to win . "
" i 've got half a notion not to go to the game , " declared <name> .
" i am going , " answered <name> .
" i do n't like that crowd , and i do n't think we were treated fairly .
just the same , for the honor of oak hall , i am going to the game and root for our side . "
" the same old <name> ! "
murmured <name> , in admiration .
" well , if you're going i am going too . "
lemington was situated several miles up the river , and while some of the boys decided to go to that town by the carryall and on their bicycles and <unk> , others decided to go up in boats .
as my old readers know , nat poole was the owner of a good-sized motor-boat , a craft he had had stored in the boathouse since the last summer .
in this boat the dudish student frequently went for a cruise up and down the river , taking his cronies along .
the fact that he owned the craft and could give them a ride , made nat quite popular with some of the students .
" i 'll take the eleven up to lemington in my motor-boat , " said nat to the manager .
" it <name> be a fine sail , if the weather is good . "
and so it was arranged .
as the weather remained warm , <name> and his chums often went out on the river for a row , and one afternoon they rowed as far as bush island , about two miles away .
on the island were some chestnut trees , and the boys walked over to see if the nuts were fit to gather .
" i see some other fellows here ! "
cried <name> , and pointed to some boys in military uniforms some distance away .
" they must be fellows from rockville academy , " answered <name> .
" i didn't think they 'd come as far as this after school hours . "
" well , i suppose they have as much right here as we have , " was <unk> comment .
they passed on , and presently lost sight of the other crowd .
then , quarter of an hour later , they came out on the island shore , to see the other lads in a rowboat , just getting ready to leave the place .
" why , there are link merwell and <name> jasniff ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" right you are , " answered <name> .
then he gave another look .
" where is our boat ? "
he questioned , quickly .
all looked around and saw that their rowboat was missing .
" they must have taken it , " cried <name> .
he raised his voice : " i say , merwell !
jasniff !
stop , i want to talk to you ! "
" not much ! "
called back <name> jasniff .
" we do n't want to talk to you , " answered link merwell .
" what have you done with out boat ? "
questioned <name> .
" that 's for you to find out ! "
returned <name> jasniff .
" <name> <name> !
<name> you have a nice time getting back to oak hall ! "
and then he and link merwell and their companions took up their oars and rowed swiftly away from bush island .
chapter x looking for a missing rowboat " we are certainly in a pickle , " remarked <name> , as the rockville cadets rounded a point of the island and disappeared from view .
" i wonder what they did with our boat , " said <name> .
" i do n't see it anywhere on the water . "
" perhaps they took it to the other side of the island , " suggested <name> .
" would they have time to do that ? "
" i do n't know .
this is a total surprise to me , <name> . "
" they did the trick on the impulse of the moment , " went on <name> .
" for they did n't know we were coming here . "
" and we did n't know they were here , " added <name> .
" let us take a look around and see if we can spot the boat . "
" all right , i 'll go down the shore and you can go up , " cried <name> , and set off at as rapid a gait as the nature of the ground permitted .
a hasty search did not bring the rowboat to light .
the boys met on the other side of the island , and stared wonderingly at each other .
" see anything ? "
" not a thing . "
" the boat must be somewhere . "
" maybe they sunk her ! "
cried the senator 's son .
" merwell and jasniff are just unprincipled enough to do it . "
" if they did that , they must have done it close to where we tied her up .
they would n't have time to take her away , " returned <name> .
" let us go back and see if we can find any trail in the mud and sand . "
they crossed the island , passing the chestnut trees as they did so .
under one of the trees <name> picked up a letter .
it was addressed to <name> jasniff , general delivery , rockville .
" jasniff must have dropped this when he was <unk> , " said <name> , as he and the others looked at the address .
" what is in it ? "
asked <name> .
" it 's open ; read it . "
" would that be fair , <name> ? "
" i think so .
jasniff is an enemy , not a friend .
it may contain some clew to his doings , and if there is anything underhanded going on we can let the authorities know . "
<name> took out the single sheet that the envelope contained .
on it was written , in a sprawling , heavy hand , the following : " my dear jasniff : " i got your <unk> and i <unk> do all i can to help you <unk> you <unk> help me on that <unk> i <unk> to you .
i know we both can make money and hardly <unk> risks .
<unk> not come to the office but meet me at <unk> on the river .
" yours <unk> , " dr. h .
montgomery . "
" why , this letter was written by that doctor hooker montgomery , the man whose silk hat we knocked off ! "
cried <name> .
" his education seems to be extremely limited , " observed <name> .
" he'd never stand at the top of the spelling class , would he ? "
" i was asking about him , and he 's a regular fakir , " said <name> .
" he is n't a doctor at all , although he calls himself one .
he puts up a number of medicines and calls them <unk> 's wonderful cures . '
i was told that he used to do quite a business among the ignorant country folks , but lately hardly anybody <unk> him . "
" and that is why he is willing to aid jasniff in some scheme , i suppose , " said <name> .
" i 'll wager it is something underhanded .
when are they to meet ? "
" it does n't say , " answered <name> .
" but the <unk> is a week old , so i presume the meeting is a thing of the past .
i guess i 'll not keep the letter , " he concluded , and cast it on the ground where he had found it .
arriving at where the rowboat had been tied up , the three chums looked around carefully , and soon saw footprints leading to a little cove , shaded by tall <unk> bushes .
pushing some of the bushes aside , <name> looked into the water and gave a cry : " here she is , fellows ! "
" have you really found the boat , <name> ? "
questioned <name> .
" yes .
she 's at the bottom of the cove .
they piled her full of stones and sunk her .
they must have had quite a job doing it . "
" and here are the oars ! "
exclaimed <name> , dragging them from the bushes .
" say , it 's going to be cold work getting that boat into shape for use , " he added , for the sun was going down and the air was keen .
" i 'll do it , if you do n't care to , " answered <name> .
" a cold plunge <name> do me good . "
" i 'll help , if you say so ? "
volunteered <name> .
" never mind , <name> ; i think i can do it alone .
no use in more than one undressing . "
the rowboat had been sunk in water three feet deep .
taking off most of his clothing , and also his shoes and socks , <name> waded into the cove and set to work taking the stones out of the craft .
it was certainly cold , and only the heavy labor served to keep his blood in circulation .
" they did n't pound a hole in her , did they ? "
asked the senator 's son , anxiously .
" i do n't see any hole , " answered <name> .
" i 'll soon know .
there aren't many more stones left . "
he had great difficulty in <unk> the bottom stone , the largest of the lot .
but , once this was removed , the boat was quite buoyant and came close to the surface .
then <name> shoved the craft close to shore , and turned it over to empty it .
" as good as ever ! "
cried <name> , and his tones showed his relief .
" now , <name> , get into your clothes again , and <name> and i <name> row you back to the hall .
we 'll be late  and you know what that means , if job haskers catches us . "
" we 've got a good excuse , " said <name> .
" but maybe haskers wo n't accept it , " he added , remembering only too well how harsh and unreasonable the second assistant teacher could be at times .
" i think i 'll do some of the rowing myself , just to get warm , " said <name> , when they got into the craft , and he took an oar ; and soon bush island was left behind .
" this is another <name> against merwell and jasniff , " said the shipowner's son , as they pulled in the direction of the school .
" i suppose they thought we 'd have to stay on the island all night . "
" yes , and maybe longer , " said <name> .
" i fancy they would n't care if we had to remain there until we were almost starved . "
" we 'll have to get back at them somehow , " came from <name> .
it was quite dark when they reached the boathouse at oak hall .
no students were in sight , all having gone in to supper .
<name> looked at his watch .
" supper is almost over ! "
he cried .
" we had better hurry if we want anything to eat ! "
" eat ?
rather !
i am as hungry as a bear ! "
cried <name> .
" so am i , " added the senator 's son .
putting the rowboat away , the three boys started in the direction of the big school building .
as they did this they saw somebody approaching them from an <name> of the east wing .
" it 's haskers ! "
whispered <name> .
" he is coming this way ! "
" let 's run for it ! "
cried <name> .
" we can get in on the other side !
quick ! "
" boys !
boys !
stop ! "
called out job haskers , as they started to run .
" i know you , <name> !
morr !
<name> !
stop , i say ! "
and he came running after them .
" it 's no use , he recognizes us ! "
groaned <name> , and came to a halt , and so did the others .
" what is the meaning of this ?
i demand to know where you have been ? "
cried job haskers , sourly , as he came up , puffing from his unusual exertions .
" we are sorry , mr. haskers , but we were out rowing , and we were detained at bush island , " explained <name> .
" did you have permission to stay away during the supper hour ? "
" no , sir .
we did n't intend to do so .
we were   " " humph !
that is no excuse , young man , no excuse whatever !
you know the rule .
go to your rooms at once  and stay there until to-morrow morning . "
and job haskers glared coldly at the three students .
he seemed always to take special delight in catching a student at some <unk> of the rules , and in <unk> out punishment .
" we have n't had any supper yet , " said <name> .
" that is not my fault , morr .
the dining-room is now about to close , and you can not go in .
it <name> be a lesson to you to be on hand promptly in the future . "
" we have got to have something to eat ! "
declared <name> , stubbornly .
" <name> !
do n't you dare to talk back to me , <name> !
if you do it again , i 'll give you some extra lessons to learn . "
" mr. haskers , wo n't you listen to us ? "
asked <name> , in a steady voice .
" we have a good excuse to offer for being late . "
" i do n't want any excuses .
it was your duty to return to the hall in time for supper . "
" we simply could n't get here .
we were on bush island , and our boat was taken away from us . "
" i saw you come back here in a boat . "
" we found our boat after a while ,  after we had lost a good hour looking for it .
then we rowed back as fast as we could . "
" pooh !
the usual story !
i want no such lame excuses !
some teachers might accept them , but not i !
go to your rooms , and at once ,  and do n't dare to come downstairs until to-morrow morning  or i 'll cut off all your holidays until christmas ! "
and job haskers folded his arms and stood like a judge before the boys .
an angry remark arose to <name> 's lips .
but he checked it and turned toward the school building , and <name> and <name> followed .
job haskers marched after them .
" go upstairs at once ! "
he ordered .
" no lingering in the lower hall ! "
for he was afraid the lads might slip him and try to get something to eat on the sly .
" mr. haskers , i wish to talk to doctor <name> , " said <name> .
" doctor <name> has nothing to do with this affair !
i am in charge here for the present . "
" do you mean to say that i ca n't see the doctor ? "
" doctor <name> is away on business .
you may see him in the morning if you wish . "
" i do n't think he 'd send us to bed <unk> . "
" it is your own fault .
you boys have got to learn to obey the rules of this institution .
perhaps it <name> be a lesson well learned . "
" i think it 's an outrage ! "
muttered <name> .
" what is that , <name> ? "
cried the teacher , harshly .
but <name> did not repeat his statement .
there seemed to be no help for it , and slowly the three students passed up the stairs and entered their dormitory .
job haskers watched them out of sight , and then stalked away , his face as grim and hard as ever .
" well , does n't this beat the nation ! "
groaned <name> , as he <unk> down on one of the beds .
" evidently old haskers has n't forgotten what happened last term , " was <name> 's comment .
" he is going to make it just as hard as he can for us . "
" i 'm as hungry as can be .
i did n't have much dinner .
<name> , are you going to stand for this ? "
" what do you mean , <name>  staying in the room until to-morrow ? "
" that and going without supper . "
" i do n't care so much about staying in the room , " was the reply .
" but i can assure you of one thing ,  i am not going without my supper . "
" how are you going to get it ? "
" i do n't know yet .
but i am going to get it somehow , " replied <name> , and his tone of voice showed that he meant what he said .
chapter xi a midnight feast while the three students were discussing the situation the door of the dormitory opened , and <name> day and shadow hamilton entered .
" hello , why were n't you down to supper ? "
asked <name> .
" we did n't get here in time , " answered <name> .
and then he related what had occurred on bush island .
" it was just like jasniff and merwell , " said shadow .
" and like old haskers , too !
i suppose he is laughing to himself now because he made you go without your supper . "
" but i am not going without it , " said <name> .
" that is , not if you fellows <name> do me a favor . "
" want me to get something from the pantry for you ? "
queried <name> , quickly .
" i 'll do it  if it can be done . "
" you ca n't get in the pantry any more , " said <name> , with a wry face .
" since <name> and i did the trick some time ago they keep the doors locked . "
" and that puts me in mind of a story ! "
cried shadow .
" once a little boy   " " quit it , shadow ! "
interrupted <name> .
" you do n't expect <name> and <name> and <name> to listen to your yarns when they are starving , do you ?
tell the story after they have filled up . "
" well , it was only a short yarn , " pleaded the story-teller of the school .
" but , of course , if we can do anything   " " you can  i think , " said <name> .
" but you must act quickly . "
" what 's to be done ? "
" since i have been here i have noticed a wagon going through on the main road every evening about this time .
it belongs to <unk> , the <unk> man of rockville .
i wish you 'd stop him and see what you can buy for us . "
and as he finished <name> took a <unk> <name> from his pocket and held it out .
" by <unk> !
i 'll do it ! "
cried <name> , readily .
" come on , shadow !
maybe we can get enough to have a little feast to-night ! "
" not on two dollars , " answered <name> .
" here 's another fifty cents . "
" oh , i 've got a little money of my own , " returned <name> .
" so have i  thirty-five cents , " added shadow .
" my allowance is behind time .
and that puts me in mind of another story .
two men were   oh , but i forgot , you are too hungry to listen to yarns .
well , i 'll tell it some other time , " and away he went after <name> , out into the hallway and down the broad stairs .
" if only they get there before that wagon passes ! "
sighed the senator's son .
" maybe the driver wo n't have anything to sell .
he may be sold out , " came from <name> .
" let us <name> for the best , " answered <name> , cheerfully .
" he ca n't be sold out of everything .
even a loaf of bread and some sardines would n't go bad . "
" or some <unk> , " added <name> .
a few minutes passed , and <name> came up to the room , and the story of the adventure on the island and with job haskers had to be told again .
<name> was as indignant as <name> and shadow had been .
" i would n't stand for it ! "
he cried .
" why do n't you report to doctor <name> ? "
" because he is away , " answered <name> .
" but i may report to him to-morrow , " he continued , thoughtfully .
a half-hour passed  to the hungry boys it seemed a long time  and then came a clatter of footsteps in the hallway .
the door was banged open , and in came <name> and shadow , followed by <name> plum and <name> watson , and each carrying a fair-sized bundle under his coat .
" we got there just in the <name> of time ! "
panted <name> , for he was somewhat out of breath .
" fact is , i had to run after the wagon to stop it . "
" and we got a dandy lot of stuff , " continued shadow .
" <name> and <name> helped us to buy it . "
" we are in for a spread to-night , " explained <name> plum .
" but you fellows can eat all you wish right now . "
the door was closed and locked , and one after another the bundles were opened .
the boys who had done the purchasing had certainly " spread themselves , " as <name> said .
they had obtained some fresh rolls and cake , an apple and a pumpkin pie , some cheese , and some cold ham and tongue , a bottle of pickles , and five different kinds of crackers in boxes .
" this is certainly a spread and no mistake , " said <name> , as he and <name> and <name> viewed the eatables with keen satisfaction .
" chip macklin has gone off to a farmer 's house for two quarts of milk , " said shadow .
" and i told him to bring some apples , too ,  if he could get them . "
" we 'll have more than if we had been downstairs to supper , " said the shipowner 's son .
" whatever is left <name> do for our spread later , " explained <name> .
" whatever is left , " repeated shadow .
" say , that puts me in mind of a story  and i 'm going to tell this one , " he added , as several of those present gave a groan .
" a little boy was looking for his shoes .
he found one and looked at it thoughtfully , and then said : 'i <unk> you is the right one , and your <unk> is the left one , but you is the left one , and your <unk> ai n't left <unk> , 'cause he 's gone . ' "
and the story produced a smile all around .
in a few minutes came a triple rap on the door  a well-known signal  and <name> opened the portal , to admit chip macklin .
the small student carried two bottles of milk under his coat , and his pockets were bulging with apples and pears .
" hurrah !
now we can have a square meal and no mistake ! "
cried <name> , as glasses were produced , and the milk was poured out .
" chip , we owe you one for this . "
" you 're welcome , " answered the little lad , with a smile .
he was glad to be of service , in return for all <name> had done for him in the past .
the eatables were spread out on a studying table , and <name> and his chums proceeded to " fill up , " as <name> expressed it .
they made a hearty meal , and yet , when they had finished , there was a considerable portion of the food left .
" we 'll not touch the pies or the fruit , " said <name> .
" those can be saved for the spread later . "
the boys were just clearing away the crumbs of the meal when there came a hasty knock on the door .
" who is there ? "
asked <name> , going to the door , but not opening it .
" it is i , murphy , " came in the husky tones of big <name> , the monitor .
" if anything is going on in there , i want to warn you that mr. haskers is coming up  i heard him tell an under teacher . "
" thanks , <name>  we 'll be ready for him , " answered the senator 's son , and passed out a pear and an apple , and then the kind-hearted monitor walked away again on his rounds .
the students worked hastily and noiselessly , and in less than three minutes the remainder of the food was stowed away in a closet out of sight , and everything about the dormitory was cleaned up .
then the lads got out their books and writing materials .
" come in ! "
cried <name> , when a knock sounded sharply , and the door was opened , and job haskers presented himself .
his face showed his disappointment at finding everything as it should be .
" oh , mr. haskers , you are just in time ! "
cried <name> , innocently .
" <name> you kindly show me how to do this example in algebra ? "
" and <name> you please show me how to translate this latin ? "
asked <name> , catching his cue from <name> .
" and i 've got a problem in geometry that is bothering me , " said <name> , smoothly .
" i have no time for lessons now , " answered the teacher , harshly .
" i have other duties to perform .
if you <name> attend to the explanations given in the classrooms you <name> need no extra aid , " and thus delivering himself , job haskers backed out of the dormitory as speedily as he had entered it .
" stung that time ! "
murmured <name> , as he closed the door once more .
" i'll wager an apple against a <unk> that he thought he would catch <name> , <name> , and <name> eating on the sly . "
" or off the table , " added <name> , and then <name> shied a book at his head .
for over an hour the lads in the dormitory turned their attention to their lessons .
during that time some other occupants of nos .
11 and 12 came in , and all were informed of the spread to be given at midnight .
to make things more lively , some boys from no .
10 were also asked to participate .
" of course you are going to ask nat poole and <name> frapley , " said <name> , with a grin .
" not on your <unk> ! "
replied <name> .
" they can furnish their own spreads  they and the whole crowd with 'em . "
" we want to look out that they do n't get wise to what we are doing , " said plum .
" it would be just like nat to give us away , if he knew . "
" if he did that he ought to have his head punched , " murmured <name> .
" say , <name> , give us a little music , before it gets past hours , " suggested <name> , and willingly enough <name> got out a banjo , tuned up , and rendered several favorites .
while the playing was going on , the door was left open , and a small crowd congregated in the hallway to listen , for <name> was really a skillful performer .
all too soon the playing had to come to an end , as the time for " lights out " arrived .
it was exactly twelve o'clock when <name> arose from where he had been resting and made a light .
at once the others also got up .
all were dressed , and it did not take long to bring the eatables from the closet and push two studying tables together for a " banquet board , " as <name> dubbed it .
he and <name> and <name> were not particularly hungry , yet they entered with <unk> into the proceedings .
the door between nos .
11 and 12 was open , and those invited from no .
10 came in as silently as shadows .
soon the feast was in full swing .
the pies were large , and were cut into just enough pieces to go around .
the fancy crackers were passed around in their boxes , and the apples and pears were placed on a tennis racket and handed around , " like an old-fashioned contribution box , " according to plum 's way of describing it .
" we ought to have a speech ! "
cried <name> .
" i move <name> <name> be called upon to speak . "
" second the motion ! "
cried several others .
" give us something on 'how to learn without studying , ' " suggested shadow .
" or 'how to do algebra while you sleep , ' " said <name> .
" or 'how to make haskers reform , ' " suggested <name> .
" do n't ask him to speak on the impossible , " broke in plum .
" you 'll never get <unk> to reform  it is n't in him . "
" i 'm too full to make a speech , " said <name> , with a smile .
" besides , we do n't want any noise up here , or we 'll be spotted sure . "
" i know what we ought to do ! "
cried <name> .
" what ? "
asked a chorus .
" pay old haskers back for the mean way he treated us .
ca n't we do something to him while he is asleep ? "
" we sure can ! "
answered <name> .
he looked at <name> .
" what shall it be ? "
<name> thought for a moment , and then a broad grin overspread his features .
" i wonder if we can manage it , " he said , half to himself .
" manage what , <name> ? "
asked several , eagerly .
" i think we can do it  if some of you fellows <name> furnish a stout line .
several fishing lines twisted together <name> do . "
" but what do you intend to do , <name> ? "
" make job haskers think there is an earthquake ,  that is , if he is in bed and asleep , and we can get into his room . "
" oh , he must be asleep by this time , " said <name> .
" and here is a stout cord .
i used it for flying my big kite , " added <name> .
" then , come on , and we 'll give job haskers a surprise .
but do n't make any noise , or we may get caught . "
chapter xii an earthquake for job haskers the door to the hall was cautiously opened , and the boys looked out .
the coast appeared to be clear , and <name> tiptoed his way out , followed by his chums .
a faint light was burning , as required by the school regulations , and this kept the students from bumping into anything .
all knew the location of the apartment occupied by job haskers , and it did not take them long to reach the door to it .
here they paused to listen intently .
" he is in there and asleep , " whispered <name> .
" yes , and snoring , " added <name> .
" that shows he wo n't wake up very easily . "
" we 'll wake him up , do n't fear  if my plan works , " replied <name> , with grim humor .
with great caution the door was tried and found to be unlocked .
then , scarcely daring to breathe , <name> stepped into the apartment , with <name> and <name> behind him , clutching at his arms .
the light in the hallway was near by , and <name> motioned for it to be turned up , so that he could see around the room .
job haskers 's bed had been turned around for this term , so that the head was next to the wall beside the doorway .
it was a new brass bedstead , ornamental but light .
with deft fingers , <name> doubled the cord provided by <name> , and tied one end to the head railing of the brass bedstead .
the other end of the cord he carried to the doorway , and threw up through the <unk> , which swung upon side <unk> .
" good , i see your plan now ! "
murmured <name> .
" i reckon we 'll give him an awakening all right enough ! "
as soon as the boys in the hallway had secured the outer end of the doubled cord , <name> stepped out of the room again , followed by <name> and <name> .
" why not lock the door ? "
whispered the senator 's son .
" the key is here . "
" just what i intended to do , " answered <name> , in an equally low voice .
the door was closed and locked , and the students all gathered in front of the portal , each with his hand on the cord .
" i wish we could dump him out of bed , " muttered plum .
" we 'll give him a little quiver first , " said <name> .
" he wo n't know what to make of it .
i do n't think he 'll notice the cord .
it is just the color of the wall . "
they pulled the cord taut , and then raised the head of the bed an inch or two .
then they let it drop .
" oh  er  who is that ? "
they heard job haskers murmur .
" is it time to get up , swingly ? "
he mentioned the name of the school janitor , who had orders to rouse him when he was <unk> .
of course there was no answer to the teacher 's question .
he waited for a moment , and then turned over in bed , as if for another <unk> .
" now we 'll give him a sharp jerk , " whispered <name> , and the students caught hold of the cord with vigor .
up came the head of the bed about a foot and swayed violently towards the door .
" hi !
hi !
what 's this ? "
roared job haskers , sitting bolt upright , and gazing about in bewilderment .
" it 's the end of the world ! "
came , in a hollow voice , through the keyhole .
" the end of the world ! "
" <name> on me !
it 's an earthquake , that 's what it is ! "
burst from the <unk> teacher , and then as the bed was jerked high in the air once more , he rolled over in the blankets and slid down to the lower end , where one foot got caught between the brass bars .
" get out of the building , mr .
haskers ! "
came a cry through the keyhole .
" it is going to shake to the ground ! "
" yes !
yes !
it must be an earthquake ! "
groaned the bewildered <unk> .
" oh , <name> i ever get out alive , i wonder ! "
the top of the bedstead was bobbing up and down , like a ship on an angry ocean .
in the darkness job haskers was completely bewildered , and he firmly believed that an earthquake had struck oak hall and that the building was in danger of <unk> .
with a cry of fright he tumbled out on the floor , and threw the covers , in which he was wound up , aside .
he tried to find the door , but the top of the bedstead was now in the way .
" the fire escape  it is the only way out ! "
he muttered to himself , and as the boys continued to jerk the bedstead around , he ran to the window and threw out a rope , fastened to a ring in the floor .
then out of the window he bounced and slid down the rope with a speed that blistered his hands .
" he has gone out of the window ! "
cried <name> , who had his eye glued to the keyhole .
" wait a minute , fellows ! "
" quick !
we must take away the cord , " said <name> , and in a trice the door of the bedroom was unlocked , the bed shoved into place , and the cord removed .
then the students scampered away , turning down the light as before .
once on the ground job haskers lost no time in getting away from the building .
each instant he expected another quake that would bring that <name> pile of bricks , stone , and mortar to the ground .
but the quake did not come .
" queer ! "
he murmured , presently .
" did n't anybody else feel that awful shock ? "
" hi , you , throw up your hands , or i 'll fill ye full o ' buckshot ! "
the cry came from behind him , and it caused job haskers to leap with a new fear .
he turned , and in the gloom of the night saw a man approaching with a gun pointed full at him .
" do n't  do n't sho  shoot me ! "
he gasped .
" up with <name> hands ! "
came from the man .
" i <unk> ye that time , didn't i ?
now , wot are ye , a ghost , a burglar , or a student on a lark ? "
" wh  who are yo  you ? "
stammered job haskers .
" did you  er  feel the earthquake ? "
instead of answering the questions , the man came closer , until the barrel of his shotgun was within a foot of the teacher 's head .
then he gave a cry of astonishment .
" why , if it ai n't mr. haskers !
wot in the world are you a-doin ' out this time o ' night , sir ? "
" <unk> ! "
faltered the teacher , as he recognized the driver for the hall .
" did you  er  did you feel the earthquake ? "
" earthquake ?
no , sir . "
" it is strange . "
" did you feel any of 'em , sir ? "
horsehair had lowered his gun and was gazing fixedly at the teacher .
" say , you ai n't walking in your sleep , are ye ? "
he questioned , abruptly .
" no , no  i  er  i am sure i am not , " stammered job haskers , yet in secret he pinched himself to make certain .
" i was  er  in bed , and i thought i felt an earthquake  the bed swayed , and i heard a cry   " the teacher stopped suddenly .
" perhaps it was those rascally boys ! "
he cried , abruptly .
" boys !
did they play a joke on <name> ?
they would n't be above it , sir  they are as full of 'em this term as ever , sir .
how did you git out o ' the building  down that rope ? "
" <unk> .
you see , the bed moved  or i thought it did  and blocked the doorway , and i   but never mind , <unk> , do n't say anything about this .
i 'll go in . "
and the teacher started rapidly across the campus .
he was , of course , in his bare feet , and was finding his pajamas anything but warm in this frosty fall air .
" you ca n't get in that way , 'less you have a key ! "
called out horsehair .
" i have no key , " and job haskers stopped abruptly .
" i can let ye in the back way . "
" that <name> do .
come , let us hurry  i am getting cold . "
the back door was gained , and job haskers entered and felt his way up the <unk> stairs .
as he reached the upper hallway he found himself confronted by doctor <name> , who had come in rather late , and who had been on the point of retiring when certain strange sounds had disturbed him and caused him to start an investigation .
" why , mr. haskers , where have you been ? "
asked the doctor in astonishment .
" i heard a noise , but i did not know you were stirring . "
" i  er  i imagined some of the students were skylarking , " faltered the assistant .
" did you catch anybody ? "
" no , sir ,  they were too slick for me . "
" this skylarking after hours must cease .
have you any idea who they were ? "
" not  er  exactly .
i had some trouble early in the evening with <name> , <name> , and morr , and they may be the ones .
if you please , i 'll take a look in their room . "
" do so , and if anything is wrong , have them report to me in the morning , " said doctor <name> , and retired once more to his room .
moving swiftly through the hallway , job haskers reached his own room and threw open the door .
he made a light , and gazed around in great perplexity .
everything was in perfect order excepting the <unk> , which were just as he had left them .
he walked slowly to the window and <name> in the rope that was used for a fire escape .
" strange !
strange ! "
he murmured to himself , as he scratched his head .
" i was sure the bed moved .
can i have been dreaming after all ?
i ate a rather heavy supper , and my digestion is not as good as it used to be . "
he put on his slippers and donned a dressing gown , and thus arrayed sallied forth once more , this time in the direction of the dormitory occupied by <name> and his chums .
he approached on <unk> and opened the door quickly and noiselessly .
but the students had had ample time in which to get to bed , and every one was under covers and apparently sleeping soundly .
to make sure they were not <unk> , the teacher came in and gazed at one after another closely .
then , with a face that was a study , he left the dormitory again and walked slowly to his own room .
" is he gone ? "
asked a voice in the dormitory , after a full minute of silence .
" yes , <name> , " answered <name> .
" but do n't make any noise  he may come back . "
" say , that was the richest joke yet ! "
chuckled <name> .
" how he must have looked , sliding down that rope in his pajamas ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" if i dared , i 'd really send in a theme to-morrow on <unk> , ' " piped up <name> vane .
" do it , <name> ; i dare you ! "
cried macklin .
" i <name>  if you 'll let me sign your name to it , " answered the girlish student , but at this chip shook his head vigorously .
" i 'll bet old haskers is as mad as a hornet , " was <name> 's comment .
" well , it served him right , for the way he treated us , " he added .
" i guess we need n't go to the doctor to-morrow with any complaint , " said the senator 's son .
" we have squared up . "
" i 'd like to know what haskers really thinks of the shaking up , " said <name> .
and then he turned over to go to sleep , and the others did likewise .
the feast and the fun had tired the boys out , and the majority of them slept soundly until the rising <name> rang out .
<name> was the first to kick the covers aside and get up , but <name> followed immediately .
" grand day , <name> ! "
cried <name> , running to the window to gaze out .
" what a fine day to go <unk> , if we could get away . "
" nothing but lessons to-day , <name> , " answered <name> .
he was bending down , looking under the bed .
" has anybody seen my shoes ? "
he continued , looking from one to another .
" i have n't seen them , " answered <name> .
he bent down to get out his own foot coverings .
" hello , my shoes are gone , too ! "
he cried .
" so are mine ! "
exclaimed plum .
" and mine ! "
came quickly from several of the other boys .
" did anybody put them in the closets ? "
asked <name> .
" if they did , they are not here now , " answered <name> , who had entered one of the closets to look .
a hasty search was made , the boys looking into every place they could think of ,  but all to no purpose .
every shoe , every boot , and every slipper belonging to them had disappeared .
chapter xiii in which some shoes are missing " what do you think of it ? "
" who took them ? "
" we ca n't go downstairs in our bare feet . "
such were some of the remarks made , as the lads of dormitories nos .
11 and 12 looked at each other .
the closets had been searched thoroughly but without success .
" see here , if anybody in these rooms hid those shoes , i want to know it ! "
demanded <name> , gazing around sharply .
" i hardly think a fellow would hide his own shoes , too , " answered <name> .
" he might ,  just to hide his own guilt . "
" i believe this is the work of some outsider , " declared <name> .
" most likely nat poole and his crowd . "
" by jove , <name> , i believe you are right ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" it would be just like them to do it , if they got the chance . "
" did you say nat poole ? "
queried shadow , scratching his head thoughtfully .
" i did .
most likely nat heard of our feast , and it made him extra sore to think we were having a good time and he was n't invited . "
" that is true , and i guess   " shadow stopped short , and a curious look crossed his face .
" what is it , shadow ?
do you know anything of this ? "
asked <name> .
" why , i  er  that is , i had a dream last night , " stammered the story-teller of the school .
" or , maybe it was n't a dream after all , " he went on , in confusion .
" see here , shadow , have you been <unk> again , and did you make off with our shoes ? "
demanded <name> .
he remembered only too well how poor shadow was addicted to walking in his sleep , and how he had once walked off with a valuable collection of rare postage stamps belonging to doctor <name> .
" i  i do n't think so , " stammered shadow , and got as red as a beet .
" but i had a queer dream .
i forgot about it at first , but now it comes back to me .
i somehow dreamed that somebody came into this room and bent over me while i was in bed , and then picked up something .
i started to stop him  and then i went sound asleep again . "
" who was the person ? "
questioned <name> vane .
" i do n't know . "
" see here , shadow , i 'll wager a new necktie that you walked off with our shoes ! "
declared <name> .
" and if you did , please be kind enough to tell us where you put them . "
" oh , <name> !
i really  i do n't think i did ! "
stammered the <unk> , in much confusion .
" the feast must have been too much for you , and it set you to <unk> , " said <name> .
" now just see if you ca n't remember where you went with the shoes . "
" the whole bunch must have made quite a load  all one fellow could <name> , " said <name> .
" yes , and he 'd have to put them in a box or a sheet at that , " added plum .
" try to think real hard , " suggested <name> .
" if he did it , it is funny that he took his own shoes , too , " remarked <name> .
poor shadow was so confused he did not know what to say or do .
he sat on the edge of the bed the picture of despair .
" i  i thought i was all over <unk> , " he murmured .
" the doctor at home was treating me all summer . "
" one thing is certain  we ca n't stay up here all morning , " burst out the senator 's son .
" i 'm going to borrow a pair of shoes somewhere . "
" so am i , " added <name> .
" we 'll hunt for the missing shoes later on . "
" say ! "
burst out shadow , half desperately .
" you  you wo n't tell doctor <name> about this , <name> you ? "
" not if you did it without knowing it , shadow , " answered <name> , promptly .
" i wo n't say a word , " answered plum .
" i  i do n't know if i did it or not , " went on shadow , his face as red as ever .
" i did n't know i took those postage stamps and those class pins that time .
but if i did take 'em ,  and we do n't find 'em  i 'll buy new shoes for all hands , if it takes every dollar i can scrape up . "
the boys donned their clothing and then went on a tour of some of the other dormitories .
thus several borrowed shoes , while the others had to be content with slippers and foot coverings usually worn on the athletic field .
" not very elegant , " remarked <name> , as he gazed at the slippers he had borrowed , " but 'any port in a storm , ' as the sailors say .
i <name> we get our shoes back . "
" so do i , <name> , " returned <name> .
" but if shadow went off with them he may have gone a long distance .
remember , he carried those postage stamps away up the river , and used a rowboat to do it .
maybe he rowed off with our foot coverings . "
" he does n't act as if he was tired  and he would be tired if he went very far with the shoes .
why , we did n't get to sleep until about one o'clock or half-past . "
" i know that .
it certainly is a mystery . "
with several of the boys appearing at breakfast wearing slippers the secret of what had happened could not very well be kept , and it soon was whispered around that nos .
11 and 12 had been cleaned out of shoes , boots , and slippers during the night , and that shadow was suspected of having walked again in his sleep .
his chums tried to hush the matter up , yet enough was said to make the story-teller of the school thoroughly uncomfortable .
" i 'd give ten dollars to locate those shoes ! "
said shadow to <name> , later on .
" so would i , " answered <name> .
" we can make a hunt after school . "
half a dozen of the students joined in the search for the missing foot coverings , and the lads looked high and low , but without success .
" only one place more that i know of , " said <name> .
" that is the old granary . "
" i do n't think they can be there , but we can look , " said shadow .
the old granary was a building located behind some of the carriage sheds .
it had once held grain , but was now used for the storage of garden implements .
the lads found the door unlocked , and pushing it open they entered and gazed around in the semi-darkness .
" i do n't see much that looks like shoes , " remarked <name> .
" i 'll strike a light , " said <name> , and did so .
the match flared up , and as it did so , several uttered cries .
" there they are , over in the corner ! "
" we have found them at last ! "
" light a lantern and see , " said <name> , and a stable lantern was quickly procured and lit .
then the boys worked their way around a <unk> and a harrow and some other farming implements to where they had seen the shoes .
" sold ! "
" these are a lot of old stuff thrown away long ago ! "
it was true  the shoes they had located were worn out and covered with mildew .
shadow kicked them savagely .
" what a sell  and just after i was sure we had found them , " he muttered .
heavy at heart the students left the granary and put away the lantern .
they had exhausted their resources , and walked back to the school in a decidedly sober mood .
" well , all i can offer is this : " said shadow , at last .
" each of you buy new shoes and slippers , and turn the bills over to me  and i 'll pay them as quickly as i can . "
" do n't you bother about my shoes , shadow , " said <name> , kindly .
" i can get others easily enough . "
" so can i , " added <name> and <name> .
" but i would like to really know whether you walked off with them in your sleep , or if this is some trick of our rivals , " continued <name> .
" you do n't want to know any more than i do , " declared the <unk> .
there seemed no help for it , and the next day all the boys paid a visit to oakdale and purchased new shoes .
they did not bother with slippers or boots , thinking that sooner or later the missing foot coverings would turn up .
the shoe dealer was all attention , for never before had he had such a rush of trade .
<name> , <name> , and <name> got fitted first , and with their purchases under their arms , they quitted the shoe shop and strolled up the main street of the town .
" there are some girls we know ! "
cried the senator 's son , presently , and pointed across the way .
coming in their direction were <name> <unk> and <name> <unk> , two girls who lived in that vicinity , and who had come to the lads ' school entertainment the year before .
<name> had a brother with whom the senator 's son was well acquainted .
" why , how do you do ! "
cried <name> , as the boys crossed the street and tipped their caps .
" so you are all back at school , eh ? "
" i thought you must be back , " added <name> , giving all a warm smile .
" yes , we are back , " answered <name> .
" how have you been since we saw you last ? "
" very well indeed , " answered <name> .
" and how did you like it on the ranch ?
we heard you had turned into regular cowboys . "
" hardly that , " said <name> .
" but we went in for <unk> , and <unk> , and all that . "
" somebody said you had some trouble with cattle thieves , " went on <name> .
" oh , <name> , do n't mention that ! "
cried <name> , and blushed a little .
" why should n't we ? "
demanded the other girl .
" i do n't believe those stories , and i think mr. <name> and his friends ought to know what is being said . "
" what is being said ? "
repeated <name> .
" yes . "
" who is talking about us ? "
demanded <name> .
" mr. merwell ,  the young man who used to go to oak hall .
he goes to rockville military academy now . "
" and what did he say ? "
questioned <name> .
" oh , he said a great many things  not to me but to some girls i know .
he said all of you had gotten mixed up with some cattle thieves , and had tried to get out of the trouble by blaming him , but that he and his father had made you stop talking about him . "
" well , if that does n't take the cake ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" is n't that merwell to a t ? "
" the shoe was on the other foot , " explained <name> .
" merwell was the one who was mixed up in the affair , and he and his father had to pay for a lot of horses that  well , disappeared .
we exposed him , and that is what made him mad . "
" did mr. merwell steal some horses ? "
asked <name> , in alarm .
" not exactly  according to his story , " answered <name> .
" he says he took them in fun .
then the regular cattle thieves took them from him  and let him have some money .
he claimed that he was going to return the horses , but did n't get the chance . "
" and he and his father had to pay for the horses in the end ? "
" yes ,  they paid mr. endicott , the owner of the ranch at which we were stopping . "
" then i guess link merwell was guilty , " said <name> .
" and after this i do n't want him to even speak to me  he or that friend of his , mr. <name> jasniff . "
" you 'll do well to steer clear of the pair , " warned <name> .
" it is a shame that they are allowed to talk about you as they do , " said <name> .
" if they keep on , they <name> give you a very bad name . "
" i do n't believe folks in rockville <name> believe much of what jasniff says , " said <name> .
" they 'll remember his <unk> of the past . "
" he and merwell seem to have made themselves popular at the academy , " was <name> 's reply .
" how they have done it i do n't know .
but perhaps they have money , or else   " the girl did not finish , for just then an automobile swung around the corner and came to a halt in front of a store near which the young people had halted .
the automobile contained merwell , jasniff , and two other students of the academy , all attired in the cadet uniforms of that institution .
chapter xiv what the girls had to tell one of the strange cadets was driving the automobile , and hardly had it come to a stop when merwell and jasniff bounded out on the sidewalk , directly in front of <name> and his friends .
" why  er  hello ! "
stammered jasniff , and then , recognizing the girls , he grinned broadly , and tipped his cap .
" how do you do ? "
said merwell , to <name> and <name> , and at the same time ignoring <name> and his chums .
the two girls stared in astonishment , for they had not expected to see the very lads about whom they had been conversing .
but they quickly recovered and turned their backs on the newcomers .
" what 's the matter  do n't you want to speak to me ? "
demanded jasniff , a sickly look <unk> his face .
" i assuredly do not , mr. jasniff , " answered <name> , stiffly .
" and i suppose you do n't want to speak to me either , " came sourly from link merwell .
" you are right , mr. merwell  i do not . "
" after this you <name> please us best by not recognizing us , " added <name> , coldly .
" oh , i see how it is  these chaps have been filling you up with stories about us ! "
cried merwell , roughly .
" well , if you want to believe them you can do it .
i do n't care ! "
and he turned on his heel and entered a nearby store .
" some day you 'll wish you had n't made such friends of <name> & company , " said jasniff , and he glared defiantly at <name> and his chums .
" maybe you 'll find that they are not just what you thought they were , " and having thus delivered himself , he , too , entered the store .
in the meantime the automobile had gone on along the street to the post-office , where the two strange cadets went in to see about mail .
" say , i think i 'll lay for merwell and jasniff and   " began <name> , when a warning pinch on his arm from <name> caused him to break off .
there was an awkward pause , neither the boys nor the girls knowing exactly what to say or do .
" well , we must be going , " said <name> .
" i promised to be home by dark . "
" and i have some errands to do before i go back , " added <name> .
" so we'll say good-by . "
" i <name> we meet again , " remarked <name> .
" maybe we 'll come to some of your football games , " ventured <name> .
" i did so enjoy some of those other games . "
" we are not playing on the eleven this season , " answered <name> .
it gave him a little pang to make the admission .
" oh , is that so ! "
both of the girls gave the boys a studied look .
" well , we must be going . "
and then they hurried down the street , around a corner , and out of sight .
" fellows , we ought to lay for those chaps ! "
cried <name> , as soon as the chums were alone .
" just what i was going to suggest , " broke in <name> .
" what good <name> it do ? "
asked <name> .
" we ca n't make anything out of merwell and jasniff by talking , and we do n't want to start a fight . "
" i 'd like to duck 'em in a mud pond ! "
muttered the shipowner 's son .
" it is what they deserve . "
" they deserve tar and feathers ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" why , in some places they 'd be run out of town .
how they ever got into rockville academy i ca n't understand . "
" money sometimes goes a great way , " said <name> .
" they may have literally bought their way in  that is , their parents may have done it for them . "
the three students had passed to the other side of the street .
now they looked down the highway and saw the automobile go around a corner in the direction of rockville .
but the machine soon came to a halt again , although they did not know it .
" well , i am going to lay them out for taking that boat , anyway , " said the senator 's son .
" ditto here , " added <name> .
" physically or mentally ? "
queried <name> , with something of a smile .
" both  if it 's necessary , " returned the shipowner 's son , promptly .
it was easy to see he was spoiling for a fight .
" i am going to see what they are doing , " said <name> , after another minute had passed .
" maybe they wo n't come out until they think we have gone away . "
he recrossed the street , and peered through one of the show windows of the store .
then , of a sudden , he made a rapid motion for his chums to join him .
" they are going out by a back way ! "
he cried .
" the <unk> !
they intend to give us the slip ! "
" they <name> n't do it ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" come on ! "
and he set off on a run , with the others at his heels .
they turned one corner and then another , and soon reached an alleyway between two houses located on a street behind the store .
here they <unk> squarely into merwell and jasniff , each with a bundle under his arm .
" so this is the way you sneak away , eh ? "
demanded <name> .
" sneak away ! "
blustered merwell .
" not at all  we were only taking a short cut ; ai n't that so , <name> ? "
" sure , " answered jasniff , loudly .
" we do n't have to sneak away from anybody . "
" we 've a good mind to give you both a sound thrashing , " cried <name> , angrily .
" you had no business to touch our boat . "
" and you had no business to talk about us to miss <unk> and miss <unk> , " added the senator 's son .
" see here , you let us pass ! "
muttered merwell .
" do n't you dare to lay your fingers on us ! "
and he tried to edge to one side .
" see here , both of you , " said <name> , sternly .
" i want to give you a final warning .
you have been talking about us ; i know it , and it is useless for you to deny it .
now i want you to understand this : if you say another word against me , or against <name> or <name> , i 'll see to it that you are exposed to every student at rockville academy . "
" you wo n't dare ! "
cried jasniff .
his voice trembled a little as he spoke .
" i <name> dare , <name> jasniff .
i know what you are  and i know what link merwell is  and i do n't propose to stand any more of your underhanded work .
now you have your last warning ,  and if you are wise you 'll heed it . "
" say , do you want to fight ? "
roared jasniff , coming forward , and sticking his <name> close to <name> 's face .
" i can defend myself , jasniff ,  even when a fellow tried to take a foul advantage of me , as you did that time in the gym . "
" bah !
always ringing that in .
i only swung the indian club to scare you .
i can fight with my fists . "
" well , remember what i said , jasniff .
it 's my last warning . "
" oh , come on  they make me sick ! "
cried link merwell , a certain nervous tremor in his voice .
" we do n't want to listen to their hot air ! "
and plucking his crony by the arm he hurried out of the alleyway into the street .
" shall we let 'em go , <name> ? "
whispered <name> .
" i 'd just as soon pound 'em good . "
" if we did that , <name> , they 'd claim we were three to two and took an unfair advantage of them .
let them go .
they have their final warning , and if they do n't heed it  well , they <name> have to take the consequences . "
" i could hardly keep my hands off of merwell . "
" i felt the same way , " said <name> .
" he deserves all we could give him . "
the three chums watched merwell and jasniff turn another corner .
they expected to see the pair walk to where the automobile was standing , but instead noted that the two cadets entered the oakdale hotel .
" must be going to see somebody , " suggested <name> .
" or else they have gone in to smoke and drink and play pool , " added <name> .
" you 'll remember merwell liked to drink .
he was the one who did his best to lead <name> plum astray . "
" yes , i remember that , " answered <name> .
" i am mighty glad <name> and he are keeping apart . "
the three students walked past the hotel , and looking in at an open window , saw jasniff and merwell talking to a man who sat in the reading room with a newspaper in his hands .
" why , that is that hooker montgomery ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" the fake doctor who sells those patent medicines . "
" we 'd better not let him see us , or he 'll be wanting a new silk hat from us , " murmured <name> .
and he grinned as he thought of what had occurred on the road on the day of their arrival at oak hall .
" i wonder if jasniff met him at <unk> 's on the river ? "
said <name> .
" that is what the letter requested , you 'll remember . "
" wonder what business jasniff was to aid him in ? "
queried the shipowner 's son .
" maybe jasniff is going to help him to dispose of some of his marvelous remedies , " suggested <name> .
" i reckon he could give the ignorant farmers as good a talk about them as montgomery himself . "
" more than likely , since montgomery is a very ignorant man , " answered <name> .
" the other fellows ought to be ready to go back to school by this time , " said the senator 's son , after watching those in the hotel for a minute .
" let us hunt them up ; " and thus , for the time being , jasniff , merwell , and doctor montgomery were dismissed from their minds .
the meeting at the hotel was an important one to our friends as well as to those who participated , but how important <name> and his chums did not learn until long afterwards .
it was a comical sight to see the boys of dormitories nos .
11 and 12 walking back to the hall , each with a shoe box under his arm .
<name> day led the procession , carrying his box up against his forearm , like a sword .
" shoulder boxes ! "
he shouted , gayly .
" forward march ! "
and then he added : " boom !
boom !
boom , boom , boom ! "
in imitation of a <unk> .
" we 've got boxes enough to last us for a year of picnics , " cried <name> , for in crumville , as in many other places , shoe boxes were frequently used for packing up picnic <unk> .
" say , that puts me in mind of a story ! "
put in shadow , eagerly .
" a girl who was going to get married had a shower , as they call 'em .
well , a wag of the town  maybe he was sore because he could n't marry the girl himself  told all his friends , in private , that she was very anxious to get a nice <unk> .
the shower was to be a surprise , and it was , too , for when it came off the girl got exactly eleven <unk> . "
" oh ! "
came in a groan .
" the worst yet . "
" not so bad , " said <name> , dryly .
" if she filled the boxes the married pair must have proved a well-bred couple . "
" hark to that ! "
roared <name> .
" say , <name> , go and take a roll ! "
" when it comes to a joke , <name> is the flower of this flock , " was <unk> comment .
" anyway , he takes the cake , " murmured <name> .
" <name> , say something ; do n't loaf on the job , " came from the senator's son .
" a joke like that is pie for <name> , " murmured <name> vane .
" even so , nobody has a right to get <unk> , " murmured plum .
" or pious ! "
continued <name> , and then shadow made a pass for him with a shoe box .
then <name> started to run , and the others came after him , and away they went in a <name> bunch , along the road leading to oak hall .
soon they came out at a point where the highway ran along the <unk> river , and there halted to rest , for the run had deprived some of them of their wind .
" i hear a motor-boat , " said <name> .
" wonder if it is nat poole 's craft ? "
" it is ! "
answered plum .
" here he comes , right close to shore ! "
the river was a good fifteen feet below the level of the roadway , and gazing down through the bushes lining the water 's edge , the students beheld nat poole 's motor-boat gliding along in a <unk> fashion .
nat was not in the craft , which was evidently running without an occupant .
chapter xv a runaway motor-boat " what do you make of that ? "
" the motor-boat must have run away from nat ! "
" either that or nat has fallen overboard ! "
" maybe nat has been drowned ! "
these and other remarks were made , as the boys on the highway gazed down at the craft that was speeding along in such an erratic fashion over the surface of the river .
a closer look confirmed their first opinion , that nobody was on board .
" i 'm going to try to stop her ! "
shouted <name> , and ran back along the highway , and disappeared into the bushes .
<name> followed him closely , and some of the others trailed behind .
" i am going up the river  to see if i can find nat ! "
shouted <name> , and away he sped , and <name> and <name> went along .
it was no easy matter for <name> to work his way down the bank of the stream .
the bushes were thick and the footing uncertain , and once his jacket caught on a root and he had to pause to free himself .
but at last he came out on a narrow strip of rocks and sand , at a point where the <unk> river made a broad turn .
the water at this point was quite shallow , and here he thought the progress of the motor-boat would be stayed .
his surmise was correct , the craft bringing up between several smooth rocks .
the engine continued to work , pounding the boat back and forth , and threatening to sink her .
fortunately , <name> had on a pair of gaiters he had borrowed , and they were so big that he slipped them off with ease .
his socks followed , and then he rolled up his trousers to his knees , and waded into the stream .
" be careful , or you 'll slip and hurt yourself on the rocks ! "
sang out the senator 's son .
" i 'm watching out ! "
returned <name> .
he was leaping from one smooth stone to another , keeping in the shallow spots as much as possible .
thus he managed to get within a few yards of the motor-boat .
as he came closer he saw that the craft was pounding on the rocks worse than before .
the pounding had in some way moved the gasoline control forward and also advanced the spark , and the engine was practically running " wild . "
" i <name> she is n't getting ready to blow up ! "
thought the youth , and he gazed anxiously ahead .
smoke was issuing from the motor-boat , coming from some <unk> oil .
he leaped to the next high rock , and then plunged boldly forward , soon gaining the bow of the craft .
at the stern the propeller was churning the water into a white foam .
the craft was trembling violently , and the hum of the machinery gave full evidence of the power it was exerting .
fortunately , <name> 's knowledge of gasoline engines now stood him in good stead , and without the loss of a second he turned off the supply of gasoline and the electric spark , and thus allowed the engine to " die . "
as the propeller slowed up and stopped , the water behind the craft calmed down , and then the pounding on the rocks was reduced to a gentle rub that did little but scratch the paint .
" is she all right , <name> ? "
called out <name> , who stood on the rocks of the bank watching proceedings with great interest .
" i think so , although it has n't done the engine any good to run wild .
she 's pretty well heated up , and the cylinders may be <unk> , or something like that . "
" what are you going to do  try to run her in here ? "
" no , i 'll not take the risk .
i only wanted to stop the engine and get rid of the risk of the boat blowing up . "
" you ran a big risk doing it .
she looked to me as if she might go up any instant . "
" she ca n't get out of here  the current holds her , " went on <name> .
" she <name> be perfectly safe until nat comes for her .
i 'd like to know where he is . "
" <name> and some of the others went off to see . "
to save the boat as much as possible , <name> took two of the wooden <unk> of the flooring and tied them to ropes hanging over the sides .
in this position they acted as <unk> , so that the rocks rubbed against the <unk> instead of the boat proper .
" i am afraid he 'll have quite a job of it , getting her out into the stream , " said <name> , on coming ashore , and when he was putting on his socks and the gaiters .
" she 'll have to back out against the current and do a lot of turning . "
" maybe he 'll have to get somebody to tow him out ,  with a very long line , " returned <name> .
" if only nat did n't fall overboard , " said <name> .
in the meantime , <name> and some of the others had run up the stream a distance .
as they turned a point where there were several small islands the shipowner 's son set up a shout .
" there is nat now ! "
" whatever is he doing ? "
queried <name> .
" swimming ashore , or trying to <name> , " answered <name> .
the boys on the shore came down to the water 's edge and watched nat poole with interest .
he was floundering around in water up to his waist .
sometimes he would come up on a rock , and then slip and pitch headlong .
but he kept on , until he was but a few yards away .
" hi , nat !
what 's the matter ? "
called out <name> .
" did you fall overboard ? "
" <unk>  help me ! "
chattered the unfortunate one , and now the others realized that he was suffering greatly from the cold .
" <name>  do n't let m  me  <unk>  go down ! "
" we 'll help you ! "
answered <name> , promptly , and ran out on some dry rocks to a point close to poor nat .
" come , give me your hand and i 'll pull you up . "
" so <name> i , " added <name> , who had come behind the shipowner 's son .
the suffering youth was only too glad to have somebody come to his aid , and he put up both hands , and those on the rocks hauled him up and then aided him to get to a safe spot on shore .
he was shivering from head to feet , and his teeth chattered so that he could hardly speak .
" i <unk>  want <unk> get where it is <unk> ! "
chattered nat .
" that <unk>  water is <name>  like <unk> ! "
" take off your wet coat , " said <name> , kindly .
" here , you can have mine .
i 've got a sweater on . "
and he passed over the garment .
nat was glad enough to <name> something dry , and the exchange was quickly made .
" if you 'll take my advice , you 'll make a run of it to the nearest farmhouse and warm up , " said <name> .
" if you do n't you may take your death of cold . "
" i  i wi  <name> , " answered nat .
" i 'll go with you .
there is a farmhouse just down the road a bit . "
" we 'll go back to where we left <name> and the others , " said <name> .
" they were after your boat , " he explained .
" did th  they st  stop <unk> ? "
" i do n't know .
we saw her , in the river , running wild .
how did it happen ? "
" i was <unk>  fixing the rudder <name>  line at the st  st  stern when all of a <name>  sudden we hit a r  r  rock or something and i we  went overboard , " answered nat .
" before i <unk> <unk> back the <unk> got away from <unk> . "
" <name> and some others went after the boat .
we saw it running by itself , among the rocks . "
nat was too cold to pay attention just then to what had become of his property .
he ran as fast as he could to the farmhouse , and there was taken in and allowed to dry himself in front of the fire , and was given a cup of hot tea .
in the meantime <name> rejoined <name> and <name> , and told how the money-lender 's son had been found .
it was after the <unk> when all of the boys got back to oak hall , and job haskers was on the point of reading them a lecture and forcing them to do without supper when doctor <name> appeared .
to the master of the school the lads related their story , and he at once excused them for their <unk> , and told them to go directly to the dining-room , while he ordered <unk> to get out the school coach and go after nat .
" poole can be glad he was not drowned , " said the doctor .
" it was nice of you to stop the engine of his boat .
but after this i want all of you to be more careful .
i do not want to lose any of my boys ! "
and the look he gave them went to the heart of every lad present .
" what a difference between him and old haskers ! "
murmured <name> .
" i 'd give as much as a dollar to have haskers leave , " added <name> .
" i reckon every fellow in the school would chip in a dollar for that , " was plum 's comment .
when nat got in he was sent at once to his room , to change all of his clothes , and was then given a hot supper , which made him feel quite like himself .
later on he questioned <name> about the motor-boat , and said he would try to get the craft from among the rocks the next day , hiring a professional boatman to assist him .
he did not thank <name> for his aid , nor did he thank <name> and the others .
" i guess it is n't in him to thank anybody , " was <name> 's comment .
" nat is one of the kind who thinks only of himself . "
" he <name> have a hard time of it , getting his boat , " said <name> , and so it proved .
it took half a day to get the craft from among the rocks , and then it was found that she leaked so badly she had to be sent to a <unk> for repairs .
that saturday was the day <unk> for the football game with lemington .
as nat could not take the eleven to that town in his motor-boat , as promised , the school carryall was pressed into service .
this made some of the other students , who had arranged to go in the carryall , find other means of conveyance , and there was considerable grumbling .
" poole said he would take 'em in the motor-boat , " growled one student .
" he ought to have seen to it that his boat was repaired on time . "
the old guard football eleven all had bicycles or <unk> , and they went to the lemington athletic grounds in a body on their wheels .
all carried the school colors , and many also had horns and rattles .
" we 'll show 'em that we can root for oak hall even if we are not on the eleven ! "
declared <name> .
job haskers took but little interest in athletics , declaring he thought too much time was wasted over field sports , but <name> <name> was keenly alive to what was going on .
he knew all about the trouble in the football organization , and he watched the departure of <name> and his chums with interest .
" are n't you going , mr .
<name> ? "
asked <name> .
" oh , yes , i am going in the carriage with doctor <name> .
do you think we shall win , <name> ? "
" we 'll win if <unk> can do it ! "
cried <name> .
" then you intend to <unk> , ' as you call it ? "
" yes , sir  we are going to root for all we are worth . "
" i am glad to know it , " answered <name> <name> ; and then he turned away to attend to some school duties .
later on , when he and the doctor were on the way to the game , he mentioned the trouble in the football club , and told how <name> and his chums had been left out in the cold , and how <name> and the others were now going to cheer for and encourage the school eleven .
" fine !
grand ! "
murmured the master of the school , his eye lighting up with pleasure .
" that is the proper school spirit !
it does <name> , morr , and the others great credit . "
" exactly what i think , doctor , " answered the first assistant .
" many players would have remained away altogether , or gone to the game to throw cold water on the efforts of those on the gridiron .
it shows a manliness that can not be excelled . "
" yes !
yes ! "
murmured doctor <name> .
" a fine lot of boys , truly !
a fine lot !
it seems a pity they were forced off the team . "
" perhaps they 'll be back  before the football season is over , " answered <name> <name> , gravely .
" what do you mean , <name> ? "
" perhaps the football eleven <name> need them and be glad to get them back . "
chapter xvi a struggle on the gridiron when <name> and his chums reached the athletic grounds they found the grandstand and the <unk> about half filled with people .
the lemington contingent had a good number of <unk> , and they were already filling the air with their cries of encouragement .
the boys looked around , but saw nothing of <name> <unk> or <name> <unk> .
" maybe they did n't think it worth while to come , " suggested the senator 's son .
" no rockville fellows here , either , " said <name> .
" they play an eleven from <unk> this afternoon . "
the lemington players were already on the field , and it was seen that they were rather light in weight , only the <unk> being of good size .
" our eleven has the advantage in weight , " said <name> .
" but i rather fancy those fellows are swift . "
" yes , and they may be tricky , " added <name> .
as soon as <name> and his chums were seated , <name> gave the signal , and the oak hall cheer was given .
then followed another cheer for the school eleven , with a tooting of horns and a clacking of wooden rattles .
" <name> !
but those oak hall students can make a noise ! "
exclaimed one girl , sitting close by .
" that is what they call <unk> ' ! "
answered her friend .
" is n't it lovely ! "
" perfectly delicious !
they ought to win , if they shout like that ! "
<name> frapley heard the racket , and walked over to the spot from whence it proceeded .
he was astonished beyond measure to see <name> leading off , yelling at the top of his lungs , and waving a rattle in one hand and the school colors in the other .
" what do you think of that ? "
he asked , of nat poole .
" oh , <name> and his crowd want to make out they do n't feel stung over being out of it , " grumbled nat .
" but they are <unk> harder than anybody . "
" they 'll be glad to see us lose . "
" we are not going to lose . "
" i did n't say we were , " answered nat , and walked away .
somehow , it made him angry to see <name> and his chums cheering , and in such an <name> manner .
he would have been better satisfied had <name> acted <unk> or stayed away from the game .
the game was to be of two halves , of thirty minutes each , with ten minutes intermission .
oak hall won the toss-up , and as there was no wind and no choice of goals , they kept the ball , and lemington took the south end of the gridiron .
" now , then , here is where oak hall wins ! "
cried <name> , loudly .
" do your level best , fellows ! "
" shove her over the line , first thing ! "
added <name> .
" oak hall !
oak hall ! "
yelled <name> .
" now then , all together in the game ! "
under the inspiration of the cheering , oak hall made a fine <unk> , and by some spirited work carried the pigskin well down into the lemington territory .
but then the ball was lost by nat poole , and the opposing eleven brought it back to the center of the gridiron , and then rushed it up to the <unk> line of the school .
" that 's the way to do it ! "
yelled a lemington supporter .
" you 've got 'em going ! "
" send it back ! "
yelled <name> .
" all together , for oak hall ! "
and this cry was taken up by a hundred throats .
<name> frapley got the ball , a minute later , and made a really fine run around the lemington left end .
this brought the pigskin again to center , and there it remained for nearly five minutes , the downs on both sides <unk> little or nothing .
a scrimmage followed , in which one lemington player was injured , and he accused one of the oak hall fellows , a new player named bemis , of foul play .
this protest was sustained , and bemis was retired and another new player named <unk> was substituted .
" five minutes more ! "
was the cry , and again both <unk> went at it .
<name> suddenly saw the captain of the <unk> make a certain sign to some of his men .
" they are up to some trick ! "
he cried to his chums , and hardly had he spoken when the ball went into play , through center and across to the left end .
it was picked up like a flash , passed to the <unk> , who was on the watch for it , and carried toward the oak hall line with a rush .
" a touchdown for lemington ! "
" that 's the way to do it ! "
" now , higgins , make it a goal ! "
amid a wild cheering , the pigskin was brought out for the kick , and the goal was made .
" that 's the way to do it ! "
" now for another touchdown ! "
again the pigskin was brought into play .
but while it was still near the center of the field the whistle blew and the first half of the game came to an end .
score : lemington 6 , oak hall 0 .
it must be confessed that it was a <unk> eleven that <unk> into the oak hall dressing-room to discuss the situation .
" you want more snap ! "
cried <name> rand , the manager .
" they put up a trick on us ! "
grumbled nat .
" they got that touchdown by a <unk> . "
" well , i wish we could make one in the same way , " retorted rand .
since being elected manager , he had had anything but an easy task of it to make the eleven pull together .
some of the old players wanted <name> , <name> , <name> , and the others back , and threatened to leave unless a change was made .
" this looks as if oak hall was out of it , " whispered <name> to his chums , during the intermission .
" oh , i do n't know , " returned <name> .
" a touchdown and a goal is n't such a wonderful lead . "
at the beginning of the second half it was seen that <name> frapley and his <unk> were determined to do something if they could .
but they were excited and wild , and the captain could do little to hold them in .
several times they got confused on the signals , and once one of the new ends lost the ball on a fumble that looked almost childish .
inside of ten minutes , amid a mad yelling from the lemington supporters , the ball was forced over the oak hall line for another touchdown , and another goal was kicked .
then , five minutes later , came a goal from the field .
" hurrah !
that 's the way to do it ! "
yelled a lemington supporter .
" fifteen to nothing ! "
cried another .
" thought oak hall knew how to play football ! "
" they ought to play some primary school kids ! "
" you shut up ! "
screamed nat poole , in sudden rage .
" we know what we are doing ! "
" you ought to be an <unk> ,  you 're slow enough , " retorted the <unk> , and this brought forth a laugh , and made nat madder than ever .
again the ball was placed in play , and this time oak hall did all it could to hold its own .
but it was of no avail .
lemington carried the air of victory with it , and its confidence could not be withstood .
again the ball was shoved over the line for a touchdown , and again the goal was kicked , amid a cheering that was deafening .
" it 's a slaughter ! "
murmured <name> .
" i am afraid so , " answered <name> .
" too bad !
i am sorry for the school ! "
" so am i , " said the senator 's son , and <name> and <name> nodded gravely .
the last five minutes of the game only served to " rub it in , " as shadow expressed it , for lemington scored again , this time , however , failing to kick the goal .
when the whistle blew the pigskin was on the oak hall twenty-five yard line .
final score : lemington 26 , oak hall 0 .
it is perhaps needless to state that the local supporters yelled and cheered , and blew their horns , and <unk> their rattles until they were exhausted .
it was a great victory , for in the past oak hall had been a formidable rival on the gridiron .
the eleven cheered for oak hall , and were cheered in return ; and then the visitors got out of sight as quickly as possible .
" a bitter defeat truly , " said doctor <name> , while driving back to the school .
" our boys did not seem to play together at all . "
" it was very ragged work , " answered <name> <name> .
" but it is no more than i expected , from what i saw in the practice games .
our eleven <name> be able to do but little unless it improves wonderfully . "
" i believe you , <name> .
do n't you  ah  think they would do better if <name> and morr and <name> were in the <unk> ? "
" i certainly do .
but they have been voted out , so i was told . "
" ahem ! "
doctor <name> grew thoughtful .
" what does mr. dodsworth think about it ? "
the party he mentioned was the gymnastic teacher , who took quite an interest in football , although not officially .
" he thinks <name> , morr , <name> , and plum ought to be put back on the eleven .
he says it is a shame that they were put off in the first place . "
" i believe our school is to play rockville academy next . "
" yes , and i just got a message over the telephone that rockville won from <unk> this afternoon , twelve to four .
i know <unk> has a strong eleven , so rockville must be extra good this season . "
" exactly so ; and that means , if our eleven is not greatly strengthened before we meet rockville , we shall suffer another defeat , " responded the master of oak hall , rubbing his <name> reflectively .
" more than likely , sir . "
" too bad !
in these days some folks think football and baseball quite as important  ahem !  as  er  some studies .
it is a wrong idea , assuredly ,  yet i  ahem !  i think it would be a very good thing if we could show the world that our students can play football as well as do other things . "
" football is a great thing at yale , harvard , and princeton , doctor . "
" yes , indeed !
i remember well how i used to witness those stirring games , and how i would yell with the rest .
why , <name> , one year we had a <unk> that was a corker .
they could n't stop him !
he got the pigskin and skinned down the field like a blue streak , and  but , ahem !
that is past history now , " finished the doctor , bringing himself back to his usual dignity .
" but i must look into this football matter more closely , " he added with a speculative sigh .
poole , frapley , and their crowd had arranged for a banquet that night , and many others of oak hall had gathered boxes and barrels for bonfires .
the banquet was a tame affair , and not a single fire was lighted .
" we are having frost early this year , " said <name> , dryly .
" yes , it came on suddenly , this afternoon , " added shadow .
" i 'll wager you <name> hear something drop in the football team before long , " went on <name> .
" the school wo n't stand for such work as we had to-day . "
" who is to blame ? "
" rand , frapley , bemis , and nat poole . "
" then they better resign . "
" just what i say . "
during the evening the talk throughout the school was largely about the game , and nearly every player was severely criticised .
it was agreed that bemis had acted in a thoroughly <unk> manner , and he was told that he would have to resign , and he agreed to do so .
it was also agreed by the students generally that of the new players , <name> frapley had done the best work .
" give him proper support and he would be all right , " said <name> .
" but , in my opinion , the eleven as it now stands <name> never win a victory . "
" and that is what i think , too , " added <name> .
chapter xvii <unk> the eleven on monday morning the students of oak hall were treated to a surprise .
directly after chapel service doctor <name> came forward to make an address .
he first spoke about the good work that the pupils were , generally speaking , doing , and then branched off about the football game , and the poor exhibition made on the gridiron .
" in the past i have not thought it proper for the head of this institution to take part in your football and baseball games , contenting myself with giving you an instructor in the gymnasium alone , " he continued .
" but i find that these sports now play a more or less prominent part in all boarding schools and colleges , and that being so , i have thought it wise to embrace all field sports in the gymnasium department .
consequently , from to-day your football <unk> , your baseball <unk> , and your track athletics , and in fact all your sports , <name> be held under the supervision and direction of mr. dodsworth , your gymnasium instructor .
he <name> be assisted by mr. <name> , who , as you all know , was once a leading college football and baseball player .
these two gentlemen <name> aid you in <unk> your football eleven , and <name> do all in their power to give to oak hall the victories you all <name> . "
this announcement came as a <unk> to rand , frapley , poole , and their cohorts , and it was equally surprising to all of the others who had played on the eleven .
" that means a <unk> for us all right , " said one of the players .
" i can see somebody getting fired already . "
" do you suppose they intend to take the management away from me and rand ? "
demanded frapley .
" i do n't think that is fair .
rand was made manager by a popular vote . "
" if they want me to resign , i 'll do it , " snapped the manager .
he had been so severely criticised that he was growing tired of it .
" it 's a shame that we ca n't run our club to suit ourselves , " grumbled nat poole .
" if the teachers are going to do it , maybe they had better do the playing too . "
" well , they 'd play a heap sight better than you did , nat , " was the remark of another student .
doctor <name> 's announcement created such a stir that the students could think of little else during the day .
all felt that from henceforth football , baseball , and track athletics would become a regular part of the institution .
in the afternoon a notice was posted up in the hall and in the gymnasium , calling a special meeting of all who were interested in the football organization .
the meeting was called for tuesday afternoon at four o'clock , and the call was signed by mr. dodsworth and mr. <name> .
" they are not going to let any grass grow under their feet , " remarked the senator 's son , as he and <name> read the notice .
" shall you go to the meeting , <name> ? "
" of course .
and you must go , too , <name> .
i know mr. <name> and mr. dodsworth want all the fellows to be there . "
following the <unk> of the notice came word that rand had resigned the management of the eleven , and then came another notice calling for the election of a new manager .
" let us put up <name> fordham again , " suggested <name> .
" that is , if he is willing to run . "
the football meeting was attended by nearly every student of oak hall , the gymnasium meeting room being literally packed .
the only youth who was absent was <name> rand .
mr. <name> called the meeting to order , and made a neat speech , in which he advised the lads to act soberly and accordingly to their best judgment .
he said the football game with lemington had proved a great disappointment , and he sincerely trusted that the reorganized eleven would be able to lead the school to nothing but victories .
he added that as rand had resigned , they would first proceed to the election of a new manager , and then the <unk> of the eleven would be begun under the direction of mr. dodsworth and himself .
the teacher had scarcely finished his speech when <name> frapley was on his feet .
" mr. <name> , i wish to say something , " he almost shouted .
" as everybody here knows , i am the captain of the football eleven .
what i want to know is , whether i am to be the captain of the eleven or not .
if i am to be nothing but a <unk> , why , i 'd rather get out . "
it was an aggressive , almost brutal , manner of expressing himself , and it produced an uproar .
" put him out ! "
" make him resign ! "
" tell him he has got to behave himself and make good ! "
" boys !
young gentlemen !
we must have quietness ! "
cried <name> <name> , raising his hand .
and then he rapped for order .
" i 'll resign ! "
shouted <name> frapley , when he could be heard .
" i don't want anything more to do with the old team , anyway ! "
and in a rage he forced his way out of the gymnasium .
several of his friends tried to get him to return , but without avail .
the departure of frapley brought about a semblance of order , and presently the gymnasium instructor got up to talk .
what he said was directly to the point .
he said that he had prepared a list of names of former football players of oak hall , with a record of the work of each individual .
this list would be used in making up the reorganized team .
" that 's the talk ! "
cried one student .
" that 's the common-sense way of going at it . "
" merit is what counts every time , " added another .
when a vote was taken for a new manager , <name> fordham was elected almost unanimously .
in accepting , the new manager stated that he was glad he was going to have the assistance of mr. <name> and mr. dodsworth , and he hoped that from now on the club would pull together and pile up nothing but victories .
this speech was well received and loudly applauded .
then the list of football players of past seasons was read .
<name> was placed at the top of the list , with <name> , plum , <name> , and <name> following in the order named .
nat poole 's name was sixteenth , much to his disgust .
" i suppose that means that i ca n't play on the eleven , " he growled .
" you may become a substitute , " answered mr. dodsworth .
" not much !
if i ca n't play on the eleven , i know what i 'll do  i 'll pack my trunk and go home ! "
" do it right away ! "
shouted a voice from the rear of the room .
" you 'll never be missed , poole , " added another .
" all right , i 'll leave ! "
shouted poole , purple with rage , and then he left the meeting as abruptly as <name> frapley had done .
at the door he shook his fist at the crowd .
" you just wait  i 'll fix oak hall for this ! "
he added , sourly .
" how foolish ! "
murmured <name> .
" nat <name> never make any friends by acting like that . "
" do you think he 'll leave oak hall ? "
questioned another boy .
" perhaps ,  if his father <name> let him . "
following the departure of nat poole came the <unk> of the football eleven .
<name> was placed in the position he had occupied the year before , and <name> , <name> , <name> , and plum followed .
of those who had played against lemington only five were retained  those who had been on the eleven one and two years previous .
all the other players were told they would have to enter the scrub team , for a <unk> for the substitute bench .
it filled <name> 's heart with pleasure to get back in his old position .
he was unanimously chosen as captain of the eleven , and he called for some practice every afternoon that week ,  a call that was <unk> by mr. dodsworth , mr. <name> , and the new manager .
" we have got to get right down to business  if we want to beat rockville , " said <name> , to the others .
" i understand they put up a stiff game with <unk> .
if we are beaten , all the fellows who were put off the eleven <name> have the laugh on us . "
" we 'll do our best , " cried the senator 's son .
" it 's a good thing we organized the old guard , " said <name> .
" that kept us in fine condition . "
practice commenced in <name> the next day , and was kept up every afternoon , under the supervision of mr. <name> and the gymnasium instructor .
mr. dodsworth perfected the eleven in signal work , and <name> <name> showed them how to work several trick plays used effectively by the college he had attended .
many of the students wondered what <name> frapley , nat poole , and <name> rand would do .
on the day following the <unk> of the football eleven , all three students sent telegrams to their parents , and received replies the next day .
rand and frapley left oak hall , and announced that they were going to rockville military academy .
nat poole had wanted to go , too , but <name> poole would not permit it , for the reason that he had paid for nat 's board and tuition in advance , and he was not the man to sacrifice one cent by such a move .
later on he wrote a letter , stating that he did n't believe in any such foolishness as football anyway , and nat had better settle down to his studies and get some good of the money that was being spent on him .
this letter angered nat exceedingly , but he could do nothing without his parent 's consent , and so he settled down as best he could .
" i should n't wonder if rand and frapley become cronies of merwell and jasniff , " said <name> to <name> .
and so it proved ,  the four became quite intimate , and all of them vowed that sooner or later they would " settle accounts " with <name> for the trouble he and his chums had caused them .
the ringleader of the four was <name> jasniff , and he resolved to do something that would put <name> in the deepest kind of disgrace .
not to expose himself , he matured his plans slowly and with great caution .
although <name> was doing all in his power to make the football eleven a good one , he was not permitted to devote all his spare time to that organization .
oak hall , as my old readers know , boasted of a secret organization known as the gee eyes , those words standing for the initials g and i , which in their turn stood for the words guess it .
<name> and his chums were all members of this society , which was kept up mainly for the fun of <unk> new members .
" the gee eyes meet to-night , <name> , " said <name> beggs on friday morning .
" big affair  initiation of six new members .
you must be on hand . "
" i think i had better go to bed  so as to be in good trim for the football game , " answered <name> .
" oh , no , you must come ! "
pleaded <name> .
" <name> and <name> , and all the old crowd have promised to be there . "
" well , i 'll be on hand if you 'll promise not to keep us out after twelve o'clock , <name> .
the eleven has got to get its sleep , remember that . "
" all right , we 'll try to cut it short , " answered <name> beggs , who , this term , was the leader of the society , or right honorable <unk> , as he was called .
" what are you going to do ? "
questioned <name> .
" that 's a secret , <name> .
but it <name> make you laugh .
we are going to <unk> the whole six at one time . "
" very well , i 'll be there . "
" one thing more , <name> , " went on <name> , in a low voice .
" keep this from nat poole . "
" but he is a member , " urged <name> .
" he has a right to know . "
" if he knew he 'd tell on us sure  he is down on the whole crowd .
we are going to drop him . "
" i see .
well , you are leader this term , <name> , so do as you please , " answered <name> , and walked off to one of his recitations .
then <name> hurried off in another direction .
as soon as the two students were gone a third boy tiptoed his way from behind a coat rack , where he had been in hiding .
the lad was nat poole .
" i thought something was in the wind ! "
murmured nat to himself .
" i must find out just where they are going , and what they are going to do ,  and then i 'll let doctor <name> know all about it .
maybe if <name> and his crowd are caught <unk> they 'll be put in disgrace , and then they wo n't be able to play that game with rockville ! "
chapter xviii an initiation and what followed " are we all ready ? "
" we are . "
" then forward  and make as little noise as possible until we are out of hearing of the school . "
the gee eyes had assembled at the boathouse , under the leadership of <name> beggs and <name> basswood .
three of the number had gone ahead , taking with them the six new students who were to be initiated .
the members of the society had with them their robes and other paraphernalia , consisting of <unk> headgear , stuffed clubs , wooden swords , <unk> guns , and other articles too numerous to mention .
they hurried off into the woods , and there donned the robes and headgear , and lit their lanterns , for the night promised to be dark .
" i <name> nobody has found us out , " ventured <name> .
" we do n't want to get caught at this . "
he had received an inkling of what was coming .
" oh , i guess we are safe enough , " answered <name> .
" murphy said he would let us in . "
" say , talking about being let in puts me in mind of a story , " came from shadow .
" a man stayed out later nights than his wife liked .
one night he did n't come home until very late , and he stood on the sidewalk , afraid to let himself in .
along came a friend and asked him what he was doing .
'please ring the <name> and see if my wife is home , ' said the man .
so the friend rang the <name> , and the next instant the door opened , and he got a broom over his head .
'is she in ? '
asked the man on the sidewalk .
'sure she is , ' answered his friend .
'go right in and you 'll get a warm welcome ! ' "
and at this story there was a general snicker .
a few minutes ' walk brought the members of the gee eyes to a clearing in the woods .
here several lanterns had been <name> up , casting a weird light of red , blue , and green .
those to be initiated were present , and surrounding them in a big circle , the members of the society commenced to chant : " <unk> !
<unk> !
see the victims , see !
<unk> !
<unk> !
victim , bend your knee !
<unk> <unk> !
<unk> !
fall upon the ground !
<unk> <unk> !
<unk> !
sing without a sound ! "
and then came a wild dancing around the victims , with a brandishing of clubs and swords .
" hi !
do n't stab me ! "
roared one , as a sword was thrust suddenly in the direction of his stomach .
" shut up ! "
murmured the victim next to him .
" they wo n't hurt you . "
" the right honorable lord of the reservoir <name> warm up the <unk> <unk> ! "
sang out <name> , in a hoarse bass voice .
and then shadow hamilton , in his disguise , crept behind the nearest victim , and sent a stream of ice-water from a <unk> down the fellow 's neck .
" wow !
wow ! "
yelled the student , trying to break away from the pair who held him .
" <unk> !
but that 's cold ! "
" 't is for thy good we do this to thee ! "
said shadow , solemnly , and then the next victim was treated to a similar dose .
he submitted quietly , and so did the next fellow , but the fourth broke away , and started off in the direction of the school .
" hi , come back here ! "
yelled several .
" do n't you want to become a member ? "
" i  i guess i 've changed my mind ! "
stammered the youth .
" i  er  i can't stand cold baths , nohow .
if you  hello , what 's this ! "
and of a sudden he pitched over some dark object , and went headlong .
" ouch ! "
came in another voice .
" ouch !
what do you mean by kicking me in the ribs ? "
and a groan of pain followed .
" who is behind those bushes ? "
asked <name> .
" must be a spy ! "
returned <name> .
" a spy !
a spy !
capture him ! "
" do n't let him get back to the school ! "
on the instant there was great excitement , and fully a dozen members of the gee eyes rushed forward and caught hold of the escaping victim , and the fellow over whom he had stumbled .
both were dragged forward , and the light of a lantern was turned on the unknown .
" why , it 's nat poole ! "
" he was spying on us ! "
" maybe he was going to report us ! "
" you <name>  let go of me ! "
stammered nat .
he put his hand to his side .
" that fellow half killed me ! "
and he gave another groan .
" what were you doing in the bushes ? "
demanded <name> , sternly .
" me ?
why  er  nothing . "
" yes , you were . "
" i 'll wager a button he was going to report us ! "
exclaimed another student .
" it ai n't so ! "
whined nat .
" ai n't i got a right to be here ?
i 'm a member . "
" no , you are not  you 've been cast out ! "
answered a deep bass voice .
" if he wants to be one of us , he 's got to be initiated all over again ! "
said <name> , in a disguised voice .
" what say , boys , shall we do it ? "
" yes !
yes !
put him with the others ! "
" sure thing !
nat , you are just in time ! "
" we 'll give you an initiation you 'll never forget , a regular <unk> , dyed in the wool , warranted <unk> initiation , " added <name> , in tragic tones .
" i do n't want to be initiated again ! "
howled the money-lender 's son .
" i 've had enough of this society .
you let me go ! "
" not to-night ! "
was the firm answer , and much against his <name> nat was forced to go along with the crowd ; and thus his plan to find out what they were going to do , and then <name> the news to doctor <name> , was nipped in the <name> .
" we were lucky to catch nat , " whispered <name> to <name> , as the whole crowd proceeded through the woods , led by <name> and <name> .
" i am certain he was spying on us for no good purpose . "
" exactly , <name> , and we want to watch him right along , " returned the senator 's son .
" first thing you know , he 'll be giving our football signals and tricks away to rockville and the other schools we are going to play . "
nat had been forced to join the other victims , and the seven were marched a distance of a quarter of a mile .
the crowd came out on the bank of the river , at a spot where several <unk> had recently been erected .
" now , we 'll give you the famous slide for life ! "
cried <name> , and pointed to the upper portion of one of the <unk> , where a big wooden slide led downward into the <unk> river .
" i ca n't stand cold water ! "
cried the victim who had previously tried to run away .
" 'twill do you a power of good ! "
answered <name> , in a deep voice .
" say , you ai n't going to dump me into the river from that thing ! "
roared nat poole .
" i wo n't stand it ! "
" then sit down to it , nat ! "
came a voice from the rear .
of a sudden the seven victims were blindfolded .
several protested weakly , but the others kept silent , for they knew it would do no good to attempt to hold back ; indeed , it might make matters worse .
yet nobody in that crowd wanted a ducking , for the water was cold , and they were quite a distance from the school .
some narrow stairs led to the upper portion of the <unk> , and blindfolded as they were , the victims were forced to mount these and were then taken to a room in the back of one of the buildings .
" now for number one ! "
sang out <name> , and one of the victims was rushed forward to a slide .
" <name> you can swim , <name> ! "
said one of the <unk> .
" the water is n't over ten feet deep , " said another .
" swim hard and then you wo n't take cold , " added a third .
" if you find yourself really drowning , yell for help , " put in a fourth .
" i  er  i do n't think this is quite fair   " commenced poor <name> , and then he was tripped flat on his back and sent downward with a plunge .
" oh ! "
he screamed , and then continued to go down , with great rapidity , for the slide had been looked over by the boys , and made as smooth as possible .
he shut his mouth tightly , expecting every instant to strike the chilling waters , but of a sudden his feet struck a heap of sawdust , and into this he slid up to his knees .
then eager hands seized him , and the bandage was torn from his eyes .
in the semi-darkness he saw that he had not come down the slide over the water , but down another , which ended in the sawdust pit of the <unk> .
he looked decidedly sheepish .
" have a fine swim , <name> ? "
asked one of his tormentors .
" what a sell ! "
muttered the victim .
" but anyway , it 's better than the river ! "
he added , with much satisfaction .
one after another the victims were sent down the wooden slide .
some came down silently , like martyrs , while others yelled in alarm .
nat poole was the last to be brought forward .
he was well blindfolded .
" be careful , nat ! "
cried one student , gravely .
" do n't hit your head when you go down . "
" and do n't scratch yourself on any of the nails , " added another .
" as soon as you hit the water somebody <name> haul you in with a <unk> , " came from a third .
" i  i do n't want to slide into the water , i tell you ! "
screamed the money-lender 's son .
" i 'll catch my death of cold ! "
" you run all the way back to school and get into bed and you 'll be all right ! "
said a fourth <unk> .
" i  i ca n't swim very well !
you let me go ! "
and now nat was fairly whining .
" ca n't do it , nat !
here is where you get a first-class , a no .
1 , bath ! "
was the cry , and then the victim was sent flat on his back on the wooden slide .
he let up a shriek of agony , and another shriek as he commenced to slide down .
then he lost his nerve completely , and uttered yell after yell , only ending when he struck the sawdust with such force that he turned a complete <unk> and got some sawdust in his mouth and nose .
" my , but he certainly knows how to scream ! "
remarked <name> , as he and the others rushed below , to join the crowd .
" i <name> he does n't rouse the neighborhood . "
when the cloth was removed from nat 's eyes , and he had a chance to see where he had landed , he was the maddest lad present .
all the other victims were laughing at him , and the club members almost doubled up in their mirth .
" think you 're smart , do n't you ? "
he snarled .
" but you just wait ! "
" want more of the initiation ? "
demanded <name> .
" no , i do n't !
you let me go !
i 'm going back to the school ! "
" so are we , nat , and you 'll go with us , " answered shadow .
" do n't let him get away from us ! "
he whispered to his friends .
" well , this winds up the initiation , " said <name> , throwing off his headgear , a movement that was followed by the others .
" you fellows are now full-fledged members of the gee eyes . "
" and i 'm glad it is over , " answered one of the victims .
" say , but that was a dandy shoot the <unk> ! "
he added , half in admiration .
" it is not quite as firm as it might be , " said <name> .
" it needs more bracing up on the sides .
the carpenters are n't done , i suppose . "
" i thought it was mighty shaky myself , " put in <name> .
" why , once i thought it was going down with us . "
" oh , it 's as sound as a dollar ! "
cried shadow .
" of course , with such a crowd   " shadow did not finish , for from above the boys in the sawdust pit , there came a sudden ominous cracking .
in the semi-darkness of the night they saw a brace snap in twain .
another brace quickly followed , and then the wooden slide commenced to sway from side to side .
" it 's coming down ! "
yelled <name> , hoarsely .
" get out of here quick  unless you want to be killed ! "
chapter xix sneak against sneak it was a time of extreme peril for the boys in the sawdust pit at the bottom of the wooden slide , and nobody realized this more thoroughly than did <name> .
in some manner the wooden <unk> had become loosened , and the ponderous slide was in danger of coming down with a mighty crash on their heads .
if it did this , more than likely some of the lads would be seriously injured , if not killed .
" jump from the pit ! "
yelled <name> , and caught <name> by one hand and <name> by the other .
all made a wild scramble , kicking the sawdust in all directions .
" let me get out of here ! "
" confound this robe , i 'm all tangled up in it ! "
" my foot is caught !
help me , wo n't you ? "
such were some of the cries that arose , as , in a bunch , the boys tried to get out of the sawdust pit .
all succeeded but <name> beggs , who , while on the rim of the pit , slipped and fell back ,  just as another brace snapped , and the ponderous wooden slide <unk> still more .
" help me ! "
yelled <name> .
" do n't leave me , fellows ! "
" here , give me your hand ! "
cried <name> , turning back , and as the hand was thrust towards him , he gave a jerk that brought <name> out in a hurry .
by this time most of the boys had run to a safe distance , and <name> and <name> lost no time in following .
" all here ? "
demanded <name> .
the lanterns had been left behind , so that they could see only with difficulty .
a rapid count was made , and it was learned that all were safe .
one student had scratched his face , and another had wrenched his ankle , but in the excitement these minor injuries were scarcely noticed .
" thank fortune we are out of that ! "
panted <name> .
" i 'm mighty glad i was n't killed , " added <name> .
" i wonder if the slide is really coming down after all , " remarked <name> .
" it does n't seem to be moving any more . "
all peered forth in the semi-darkness at the big wooden affair .
it had <unk> in the middle , and the top had twisted several feet to one side .
another brace looked as if it was on the point of breaking and letting it down still further .
" better get out of here , " said nat poole .
" if the owner of the <unk> finds this out he 'll make you pay for the busted slide . "
" well , i think we ought to pay for it , anyway , " answered <name> , quickly .
" we broke it . "
" huh !
i would n't pay a cent unless i had to , " grumbled the money-lender 's son .
" what about our lanterns ? "
asked <name> .
" that 's so ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" they are all up in the <unk> , or down in the sawdust pit . "
" we ca n't leave them there ,  they may set fire to something , " said <name> .
" we 'll have to get them , " decided <name> .
" oh , but that 's dangerous ! "
cried one of the students who had just been initiated .
" why , the slide might come down just as we were getting the lanterns ! "
" yes , and i do n't want to be killed for the sake of four or five lanterns , " added another .
" it 's not a question of the worth of the lanterns , " said <name> .
" we must n't leave them here because of the danger of fire .
if we left them , and the <unk> burnt down , we 'd have a nice <name> to pay ! "
" oh , do n't croak so much ! "
growled nat poole .
" i 'm going back to school .
it 's cold here . "
" you stay where you are , nat ! "
cried <name> , catching him by the arm .
" you 'll go back with the rest of us , and not before . "
with caution <name> , followed by <name> and shadow , approached the <unk> , and climbed up one of the ladders nailed to the side of the building .
then they ventured out on a corner of the slide , and secured two of the lanterns .
" we 'll have to go down part of the slide for that other , " said the shipowner 's son .
" no , do n't do that , for your weight may bring the slide down , " returned <name> .
" i 'll get a long stick and see if i ca n't get the lantern with that . "
a stick was handy , and fixing a bent nail in the end , <name> reached down , and after a little trouble secured the lantern .
then the boys went below and secured the lanterns in the sawdust pit .
" hi !
what are you boys doing here ? "
demanded an unexpected voice from out of the darkness , and by the light of the lanterns the students saw a man approaching .
he had a stick in one hand and an old-fashioned <unk> in the other .
" who are you ? "
questioned <name> , as leader of the gee eyes .
" who am i ?
i am <name> <name> , the owner of these <unk> , that 's who i am !
and i know you , in spite of them <unk> dresses you 've got on .
you 're boys from oak hall . "
" you 've hit the nail on the head , mr .
<name> ! "
cried <name> .
" glad to see you ! "
and he walked forward and held out his hand .
" who be you ? "
demanded <name> <name> , and peered at the shipowner 's son curiously .
" well , i declare , if it ai n't the young man as stopped the runaway hoss fer my wife !
glad to see you ! "
and the <unk> man shook hands cordially .
" up to some secret fun , i suppose . "
" yes , sir . "
" i thought i heard a <unk> ' around the <unk> , and i told my wife i 'd dress and come over and see what it meant .
<name> you ai n't done no damage , " the man continued , somewhat anxiously .
" we have done a little damage , i am afraid , " answered <name> .
" but we are willing to pay for it . "
" what did ye do ? "
in as few words as possible <name> and some of the others explained the situation .
they were afraid <name> <name> would be angry , but instead he broke into a laugh .
" ai n't it the greatest ever ! "
he cried .
" you ai n't done no damage at all .
the carpenters put that wooden slide up wrong , and i told 'em they 'd have to take it down , and they started to-day .
that 's what made them <unk> 's bust .
the hull thing is comin ' down ,  so what you did do n't hurt , nohow . "
" i am very glad to hear that ! "
cried <name> , and the others said practically the same .
then they bade good-night to the <unk> owner , and hurried in the direction of oak hall .
" it 's a good thing , <name> , that you knew mr. <name> , " said <name> , on the way .
" but you never told me about stopping a runaway horse for mrs .
<name> . "
" oh , it was n't much ! "
answered the shipowner 's son , modestly .
" it happened last <name> , just before we started for <name> ranch .
the horse was running along the river road , and i got hold of him and stopped him , that 's all .
mrs. <name> was going to tell doctor <name> about it , but i got her to keep quiet . "
" <name> , you 're a hero ! "
and <name> gave his chum 's arm a squeeze that made <name> wince , but with pleasure .
murphy , the monitor , was on the watch for them , and let them in by a back door .
all lost no time in getting to their dormitories and in undressing and going to bed .
everybody in the crowd was satisfied over the <unk> but nat poole .
his plot to expose <name> and his chums had failed , and he was correspondingly sour .
" but i 'll fix them yet , " muttered the money-lender 's son , to himself .
" just wait till they start to play rockville , that 's all ! "
and the thought of what he had in mind to do made him smile grimly .
it must be confessed that some of the football players felt rather sleepy the next morning .
<name> was sleepy himself , and this alarmed him not a little .
" if we lose the game with rockville to-day it <name> be our own fault , " he said , to the crowd that had participated in the gee eyes ' doings .
" we should have gotten home at least an hour earlier than we did last night  or rather this morning . "
and then he made each player take a good rubbing down and just enough exercise to limber up his muscles .
<name> had not forgotten what had been said about nat poole , and directly after breakfast he called chip macklin to one side .
as my old readers know , chip had once been the sneak of the school , and he knew well how to <name> around and take notice of what was going on .
" chip , i 've got some work for you , " said <name> , in a low voice .
" i may be mistaken  in fact , i <name> for the honor of the school that i am .
but i do n't trust nat poole .
he is down on some of us because we have gotten back on the eleven , and you 'll remember how <unk> he used to be with jasniff and merwell , who are now going to rockville ,  and with rand and frapley , and they are now going to the academy also .
i am afraid that nat   " " that nat <name> try to sell you out ? "
finished chip , his little eyes snapping expectantly .
" yes .
he may give our signals away , or something like that . "
" i see .
and you want me to watch  and report , if i see anything wrong ? "
" yes . "
" i 'll do it .
i 'd like to catch him  for he never treats me decently , " added chip .
it had been decided that some of the boys should go to rockville by boats and others by carriages and on their bicycles and <unk> .
the eleven were to go in the school carryall , and mr. dodsworth and <name> <name> were to go with them .
owing to the change in the academy management , but little had been done to the athletic field , and when the oak hall club arrived , they found the grounds rather uneven and poorly marked .
" bad for really good playing , " remarked <name> .
" you 'll have to be on your guard , " warned <name> <name> .
" this field should have been rolled down after the last storm . "
the grandstand was rather a small affair , and it speedily became filled with visitors , for the annual football game between the two schools was always a great drawing card .
flags and banners were much in evidence , and so were horns and rattles .
" i wonder if any outsiders we know are present ? "
remarked <name> to his chums , as they walked across the field .
" somebody is waving from the corner of the stand , " answered <name> .
" i think it is miss <unk> . "
" it is , and miss <unk> is with her , and so is mr. <unk> , " answered <name> , and then the boys took off their caps in salutation .
and then they recognized a number of other friends .
the eleven had just turned into its dressing-room , to prepare for the game , when chip macklin came running in all out of breath .
" i want to see <name> ! "
he gasped , and then , as soon as the pair had walked to a corner , he went on : " i caught nat . "
" what doing ? "
demanded <name> , quickly .
" giving all of your signals away to merwell , jasniff , and one of the rockville football players .
he started to tell about your trick plays when he saw me standing near , and shut up . "
" where is he now ? "
" in the grandstand , with some girl . "
" i <name> attend to this at once , chip .
come with me . "
<name> led the small student out of the dressing-room , and called <name> <name> and mr. dodsworth .
quickly the situation was explained .
the school teacher looked shocked , and the gymnastic instructor was disgusted .
" i <name> take care of poole , " said mr. <name> , in a strained voice .
" mr. dodsworth , you had better arrange for a change of signals . "
" i <name> , " answered the gymnastic instructor .
and then <name> <name> hurried off , and <name> returned to the dressing-room , accompanied by mr. dodsworth .
the signals were <unk> , and so were the signs for some of the new trick plays .
" now then , boys , let me give you a bit of advice , " said mr. dodsworth , when they were ready to go out on the field for practice .
" from what i have heard rockville has good staying powers , and <name> try to tire you out .
your move is to go at them with a jump and make your points early in the game  and then hold them down .
now do your best  and do n't give in until the last whistle blows ! "
chapter xx the great game with rockville " <name> , i think i see a chance of catching rockville napping , " said <name> , just before the practice began .
" you mean , if they try to take advantage of our signals ? "
" yes .
if they feel sure we are going to do one thing and we do another , they 'll get left . "
" well , they 'll deserve to get left  if they try to profit by any such work . "
" maybe the eleven wo n't stand for it . "
" oh , i do n't know .
rockville is hungry for a victory over us , and they may think all is fair in love and war and football , " broke in <name> .
as each eleven came on the gridiron it was roundly cheered .
the rockville supporters at once commenced their well-known <unk> : " rockville !
rockville !
you 'll get your fill of rockville ! "
and immediately oak hall replied with its own well-known cry : " baseball !
football !
oak hall has the call !
<unk> !
boom !
bang !
whoop ! "
and then from both sides arose a great din of horns and rattles .
in the rear of the field were several automobiles and they , too , let off their horns and <unk> whistles , adding to the noise .
the practice at an end , the toss-up followed , and this was won by rockville , and they elected to take the ball .
out on the gridiron spread the two <unk> , each player eager to do his best .
then the whistle blew , there came a kicking of the pigskin , and the great game was on .
the play was fast and furious from the start , and in a very few minutes <name> and his chums understood that to gain a victory was going to be no easy thing .
rockville had the advantage in weight , and long practice had put every man in the pink of condition .
but the trick that nat poole had tried to play bore unexpected results .
the <unk> was a good one , but the pigskin was caught by <name> and he brought it back almost to the center of the gridiron , being aided by clever interference on the part of <name> and plum .
then the signal was given to <name> the ball through the center .
the rockville players thought it was a signal to run around the left end , and moved accordingly .
up the field came the pigskin , and before rockville could recover from the error made , plum had the ball within four yards of the goal line .
here , however , he was <unk> so heavily that the wind was knocked completely out of him .
" that 's the way to do it !
hurrah for oak hall ! "
" now , shove it over , fellows ! "
" they did n't follow their signals at all ! "
whispered one player to the rockville captain .
" i know it , " was the low answer .
" do n't depend on the signals after this . "
but the damage had been done , and two minutes later oak hall obtained a touchdown , <name> carrying the ball over the line .
<name> made the kick , and the pigskin sailed neatly between the posts .
then what a cheering went up , and what a noise from the horns and rattles !
" that 's the way to do it ! "
" first blood for oak hall !
now keep up the good work ! "
as quickly as possible the ball was brought once more into play , and now the contest waged fast and furious .
back and forth went the pigskin , first in the possession of one eleven , and then in the possession of the other .
there was a fine run around the right end by <name> , and another by a player for rockville .
then came a mix-up , and each side had to retire a player , while rockville was <unk> several yards for an <unk> play .
" five minutes more ! "
came the warning , and then in a fury rockville tried to form a flying wedge  such a move being <unk> that year .
the shock was terrific , and in spite of all their efforts to stand firm , oak hall broke , and the pigskin was carried over the line .
then the goal was kicked  and the whistle blew , and the first half of the great game came to an end .
score : oak hall 6 , rockville 6 .
panting for breath , for that last shock had been a telling one , the oak hall players filed into the dressing-room , there to rest and to receive such attention as they needed .
" well , it is still our game as much as theirs , " said <name> , trying to cheer up his men .
" but we want to go at 'em hammer and tongs in the second half . "
" try that <unk> trick as early as possible , " advised mr. dodsworth .
" i do n't think they 'll be looking for it .
that mix-up on signals bothered them some . "
" did mr. <name> see poole ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , and poole was sent back to the school in care of one of the carriage drivers , " answered the gymnastic instructor .
down in the grandstand the supporters of rockville and of oak hall were having lively discussions over the merits of the two <unk> .
among the rockville students were jasniff , merwell , and frapley .
" i <name> we wax 'em in the second half ! "
said merwell to jasniff .
" how much money did you put up , link ? "
asked jasniff .
" all i could scrape up  thirty-five dollars . "
" and i put up forty dollars . "
" with the oak hall fellows ? "
" no , with some sports from the town . "
" just what i did .
of course , i <name> we do n't lose !
if we do i 'll be in a hole until my next <unk> comes . "
" oh , rockville has got to win ! "
said jasniff , loudly .
" we ca n't help but do it . "
" this is oak hall 's game ! "
cried a voice from the other end of the grandstand , and then a cheer went up , followed by another cheer from the local supporters .
" say , when do we get back at <name> <name> ? "
asked merwell , while the cheering was going on .
" i 'm getting tired of waiting . "
" we 'll get back at him very soon now , " answered jasniff .
" if what doctor montgomery tells me is true , everything <name> be ready about thanksgiving time . "
" can you depend on the doctor ? "
" i think so .
he is almost down and out , and <name> do anything for money , " answered <name> jasniff , and then the talk came to an end , as the second half of the game began .
both <unk> had been urged to do their best , and the play was as spirited as before .
rockville was unusually aggressive , and one of the players tackled <name> unfairly , giving his shoulder a severe wrench .
a protest was at once made by both <name> and <name> , and amid a general <unk> the rockville man was retired .
" never mind , they are going to put <name> in ! "
was the cry .
" he 'll show 'em what he can do ! "
<name> had been a favorite player in years gone by , but had not been allowed to play before because he was behind in his studies .
now , however , it was seen that he was sorely needed , and the rockville faculty gave the desired permission to fill the vacancy .
ten minutes of play found the pigskin near the center of the field .
then , for the first time , <name> saw a chance to use the <unk> trick which mr. dodsworth had suggested , and gave the necessary signal .
at once the entire eleven was on the alert .
the trick consisted in sending the ball over to the right , back to center , and then to the right again , some players meanwhile rushing to the left as a blind .
the movements were made with rapidity , and rockville was caught napping .
up came the pigskin in plum 's arms , and he turned it over to another player , who in turn passed it to <name> .
then <name> saw a clear space and dove for it .
he was followed and tackled , but shook himself loose , and dropped on the ball directly over the goal line .
a roar went up .
" another touchdown for oak hall ! "
" now for another goal ! "
amid a wild cheering the try for goal was made .
but a keen wind had sprung up , and the goal was missed by a few inches .
" never mind , that makes the score eleven to six in oak hall 's favor . "
once again the ball was brought into play .
there were but seven minutes of time left , and rockville played like demons , hurling themselves again and again at their opponents .
but <name> felt that enough had been accomplished , and gave the signal to be on the defensive , and thus rockville was held back , and the most it could do was to get the ball on oak hall 's thirty-five yard line .
and then the fateful whistle sounded , and the great game came to a close .
final score : oak hall 11 , rockville academy 6 .
it was a <unk> victory , and the oak hall eleven were warmly praised by their friends and the public in general , while many condemned the military academy for the roughness shown .
" oh , it was too lovely for anything ! "
said <name> <unk> , when <name> and <name> sauntered up , waiting for the carryall to take the eleven back to oak hall .
" it was indeed ! "
added <name> <unk> .
" we compliment you , and we compliment mr. <name> , too , " she added , her eyes beaming brightly .
" a <unk> game , " was mr. <unk> 's comment ; and then the boys passed on , to join their fellows .
of course the majority of the rockville supporters felt blue over the outcome of the game , and they lost no time in leaving the grandstand and disappearing from view .
jasniff and merwell went also , but in another direction .
" this leaves me high and dry , " growled merwell .
" i wo n't have a cent to spend for two weeks . "
" let us see if we ca n't borrow some money , " suggested jasniff .
" i 'd like to know who from ?
all the fellows who bet have lost their money . "
" then we 'll have to hit somebody who did n't bet  some of the <unk> fellows , " and he laughed bitterly .
" like <name> , eh ? "
" yes , <name> never bets , nor drinks , nor smokes .
i ca n't understand how he makes himself popular , can you ? "
" it 's his smooth way .
but some day he 'll be found out and dropped , " answered merwell .
" he 'll be dropped when we work our little game against him , " returned jasniff , with an evil look in his eyes .
never had the carryall contained a happier crowd of students than those who rode back to oak hall after the game .
they sang , cheered , and whistled to their hearts ' content , and nearly drove horsehair wild with their antics , climbing out of the windows and over the roof of the turnout .
" bless my heart , but you must be careful ! "
pleaded the driver .
" i don't want to hurt <unk> on this trip ! "
" oh , horsehair , we ca n't hold ourselves down ! "
answered <name> .
" such a victory is n't gained every day . "
" yes , sir , i know , sir .
but them hosses do n't know nothin ' about football , an ' fust thing you know they 'll run away , " pleaded the carryall driver .
" we 'll take a chance , " put in <name> , brightly .
" now , then , all together ! "
and out on the air rolled the old school song to the tune of auld <name> syne , and then followed a cheering that could be heard for half a mile .
" bonfires to-night ! "
announced <name> beggs .
" the biggest yet . "
" say , that puts me in mind of a story   " began shadow , but what he wanted to tell was lost in a tooting of horns and a clacking of rattles that lasted until oak hall was reached .
chapter xxi thanksgiving , and a snowballing contest the celebration that night was a grand affair , and doctor <name> allowed the students to remain out until midnight .
many bonfires were lighted , and the boys danced around , sang songs , and played many practical jokes on each other and on horsehair and pop swingly .
shadow was in his element , and was permitted to tell a dozen or more of his yarns , much to his own satisfaction if not of his listeners .
the only boys who felt blue were nat poole and the lads who had played against lemington and then been put off the eleven .
nat had received a sharp lecture from the doctor and then been sent to his room , to remain there until the following morning .
he wanted to pack up and go home , fearing the jeers of his <unk> when they learned of his meanness , but he did not dare to make this move , for his father had written him a sharp letter , telling him to finish out the term at oak hall or otherwise to go to work ,  and nat did not want to go to work .
of course the victory over rockville made <name> and his chums feel good .
the whole eleven were warmly congratulated by the doctor , and by mr. <name> and mr. dodsworth .
the game with the military academy was followed by a number of other contests , and the school made a fine record for itself , winning six games out of eight .
the two games lost were with college boys , and these players were all considerably heavier than the oak hall lads .
the last game took place on thanksgiving day , and was witnessed by <name> 's father and mr. wadsworth , and also by <name> and <name> .
oak hall won this contest by a score of 18 to 11 .
" oh , it was grand , <name> ! "
cried <name> , after the boys had left the gridiron .
" that run you made was the best ever ! "
" you all did well , " said <name> .
" it makes my blood tingle , and i feel like getting into the game myself , " said <name> wadsworth .
" it was a clean-cut contest from start to finish . "
<name> and some of the other boys were going home , and soon said good-by .
mr. <name> and mr. wadsworth went off with doctor <name> , and that left <name> and <name> with the two girls .
as senator morr was at home from washington , it was decided that the young folks should pay <name> 's home a visit for the rest of the day , mr. <name> and mr. wadsworth coming there in the evening to take <name> and <name> back to crumville .
the young folks made a jolly party as they boarded the train .
they turned over one of the double seats and sat facing each other , and laughed and chatted until <unk> was reached .
here a carriage awaited them , and they were driven to the morr mansion , where they received a warm greeting from the senator and his wife .
the girls had much to tell about themselves , and then asked about matters at the school .
they were indignant to learn that nat poole had exposed the football signals .
" it is just like him  the sneak ! "
cried <name> .
" oh , <name> , i <name> you do n't have anything more to do with him . "
" i am willing to let him alone if he <name> let me alone . "
" do you hear anything from link merwell ? "
questioned <name> .
" not much .
but i understand he and <name> jasniff have it in for me . "
" then , <name> , you must be on your guard , " cautioned his sister .
" i think merwell is a regular snake in the grass  his actions at the ranch prove it  and jasniff is no better . "
" jasniff is worse , " said <name> .
" he is a brute . "
the boys and girls spent a happy evening together , and all too soon mr. <name> and mr. wadsworth arrived to take <name> and <name> back to crumville .
the boys hated to see them go , and went to the depot with them .
there was some warm handshaking , and then the train rolled away , and the boys went back to the house .
" splendid girls , both of them , " was <name> 's comment , and <name> quite agreed with him .
but he was thinking more about <name> than his sister ,  and it is quite likely <name> was thinking more about <name> .
the boys remained at <name> 's home until saturday afternoon , and then returned to oak hall .
the air was heavy and very cold , and they were glad to get out of the carryall , rush into the school , and warm up .
" feels like snow to me , " said <name> ; and he was right .
it started to snow that night , and kept it up for the greater part of <name> , so that by monday the ground was covered to the depth of a foot or more .
" hurrah , for a snowballing match ! "
cried <name> .
" everybody in the line after school . "
" let us choose sides , " suggested <name> .
" instead of having an army of the north and an army of the south , we can have   " " an army of red and an army of blue , " finished <name> .
" what do you say to the red <unk> against the blue <unk> ? "
as many lads of the school wore red <unk> , and about an equal number wore blue , the idea caught on instantly , and at the noon recess the two armies , of red and of blue , were hastily organized .
each numbered twenty-five recruits , and <name> was made the leader on one side and <name> day the leader on the other .
with <name> went <name> and <name> , while <name> , <name> , and shadow sided with <name> .
<name> 's side was the army of red , and they made themselves a big red flag , with the initials o. h. on it .
not to be outdone , <name> 's army made a big blue flag , also with the school initials .
it was decided that the army of blue was to take a position in the woods , and that the army of red was to try to dislodge them and force them to retreat .
if either army was driven back two hundred yards it must give up its flag and count itself beaten .
after school half an hour was allowed for getting ready , and most of that time was consumed in making snowballs and in <unk> the edge of the woods by throwing up a <unk> .
then a bugle belonging to one of the students sounded out , and the great snowball battle began .
it was certainly a hot contest , and the snowballs flew in all directions , and many a " soldier " received one in the body or in the head .
<name> had placed his followers with care , and try their best the army of red could not dislodge them .
" i have a scheme , " said <name> , after the battle had lasted for fully half an hour , and while the boys were pausing to manufacture fresh " ammunition " in the shape of snowballs .
" let us rush up and then pretend to retreat .
they 'll think they have us on the run , and as soon as they leave the woods and that <unk> , we can turn on 'em again , and wallop 'em . "
" if you try that , be sure of one thing , " said <name> .
" have plenty of snowballs on hand .
otherwise that fake retreat may become a real one . "
" we 'll make a lot of snowballs , " said <name> .
" pitch in , everybody ! "
in a little while , the army of red was ready for the movement <name> had suggested .
then <name> explained just how it was to be carried out .
they were to advance on the left wing of the blues and then retreat in the direction of the road .
as soon as the blues came from cover , they were to drive them  if they could be driven  to the upper edge of the woods and across the field beyond .
" now then , all together ! "
cried the senator 's son .
" and make them think you are really retreating , at first . "
forward went the army of red , throwing snowballs wildly .
then came a shower of balls in return , and several of the reds were seen to fall , as if knocked down .
then came a pause , and several lads started to go back .
" stop !
do n't run ! "
yelled <name> .
" do n't run ! "
but as this was part of the deception , those in retreat kept on backing away .
" hurrah !
we 've got 'em on the run ! "
came from the woods , and in a trice several of the army of blue appeared on the top of the <unk> .
" come on , let us <name> 'em ! "
over the <unk> came the army of blue , carrying all the snowballs it could manage .
the army of red continued to retreat , each boy loaded down with ammunition .
then , just as the edge of the woods was cleared , a loud whistle sounded out .
it was the signal to turn , and like one man the army of red faced about , and let fly a heavy volley of snowballs , directly in the face of the enemy .
the blues were taken completely by surprise , and almost dazed .
then came another volley of snowballs , and a dozen lads were struck , in the head and elsewhere .
" wow ! "
yelled one boy .
" say , what are we up against ? "
" let 'em have it ! "
came the rallying yell of the reds .
" down with 'em !
drive 'em to cover ! "
and on they came with a rush , throwing their snowballs with all the accuracy possible .
the severe onslaught demoralized the other army for the time being , and two boys broke and ran  then half a dozen more  and then the whole army .
" stop !
turn and face 'em ! "
yelled <name> .
" give it to 'em hot ! "
but this was not to be , for the reason that the blues were out of ammunition .
they ran close to the woods , but were driven from that cover by a flank movement , and then took to the field , trying to manufacture snowballs as they ran .
" we 've got 'em going  do n't let up ! "
cried <name> , and , having stopped to make a few more snowballs , he pushed on , with <name> and half a dozen others beside him .
<name> carried the flag , and all made for where the enemy had its flag of blue .
then came an exchange of snowballs at close range , and poor <name> was hit in the face .
he dropped the flag , and <name> picked it up .
" much hurt , <name> ? "
asked <name> , anxiously .
" i guess not , " was the plucky reply .
" go on and wax 'em ! "
and then <name> turned back for a moment to catch his breath .
at the edge of the field was a ridge , and back of this a deep hollow .
<name> decided to take a stand behind the ridge , and so directed his followers .
" but look out for the holes , " said one of the boys .
" some nasty ones around here . "
the battle soon waged as fiercely as ever .
on came the army of red with a fresh supply of ammunition , and snowballs flew in all directions .
poor <name> was struck in the ear , and the carrier of the flag was hit in the arm and in the mouth .
down went the flag , and before the carrier could pick it up , three of the enemy pounced upon him , and while two held him , the third captured the all-important trophy .
" hurrah !
we 've got their flag !
now drive 'em along ! "
was the cry .
" we must get the flag back ! "
called out <name> .
" now then , all together ! "
and again the battle went on .
" now , for a final rush ! "
said <name> , after the blue flag had been taken to the rear .
" we are going to win !
come on ! "
and he led the way .
near the top of the ridge , the red and the blue fought fiercely , for all the boys were now thoroughly warmed up .
back and forth surged the long lines , and for several minutes it looked as if the blues might succeed in driving the reds back .
once <name> came close to losing the flag , and only saved it by sending two of the enemy sprawling headlong in the snow .
at last the reds managed to reach the top of the ridge , and from that point send down a fierce shower of snowballs .
the blues could not withstand this fire , and broke and ran .
" hurrah !
the victory is ours ! "
yelled several of the reds .
" let us clinch it , and make 'em cry for <name> ! "
shouted one of the victorious army , and forward he went , and nearly all of the others after him .
" be careful ! "
cried <name> .
" there are a lot of holes around here !
somebody may break a leg . "
his voice was drowned by the shouts of those who had won , and over the ridge and towards the hollow poured the victors and vanquished  the latter trying to dodge the fresh shower of snowballs .
" it 's all over  let up ! "
yelled one boy of the army of blue .
" let up , ca n't you ? "
" one last shower , fellows ! "
cried <name> .
" now then , all together ! "
the snowballs were delivered , and then came a pause , as all realized that the battle was at an end .
then , from the far end of the hollow , came an unexpected yell : " help !
help !
i am down in a hole and ca n't get out !
help ! "
chapter xxii in which the shoes come back " somebody is in trouble ! "
" who is it ? "
" where is he ? "
" it is <name> hally ! "
cried <name> , mentioning one of the new boys at oak hall .
" he must have fallen into one of the holes near the big hollow . "
" come on and see what is the matter , " said <name> , and dropping the flag , he sped in the direction of the cries , and a dozen others followed .
when they reached the spot from which the cries for help had proceeded they could see nothing of <name> hally .
" he was here a minute ago  i saw him ! "
declared a student named messmer .
" he must have gone down out of sight ! "
" be careful that somebody does n't go down on top of him , " cautioned <name> .
he had hardly spoken when there came a cry from messmer , and , looking in his direction , the other boys were horrified to see him sink into the snow up to his waist .
" hi !
hi !
help me ! "
yelled messmer .
" quick , something has me by the foot ! "
" maybe it 's hally , at the bottom of the hole ! "
burst out <name> .
" let us make a chain and haul him out , " suggested <name> .
this suggestion was considered a good one , and in a twinkling a long line was formed , the boys taking hold of each other 's hands .
<name> was at one end of the line , and he approached messmer with caution .
" help me ! "
gasped messmer .
" something is dragging me down ! "
" take hold of my hand , " answered <name> .
" hold tight ! "
messmer did as requested , and then <name> gave the other boys the signal to haul away .
" but be careful , " he added .
" otherwise the line may break , and some more of us <name> go in the hole . "
the students hauled steadily and cautiously , and slowly but surely messmer came out of the snowy hole .
as his feet came into view it was seen that a pair of hands were clasped around one of his ankles .
" <name> hally is there ! "
shouted <name> .
" be extra careful , or he may slip back ! "
he had hardly spoken when messmer 's foot came up with a jerk .
the unfortunate boy below had let go , being probably too exhausted to keep hold .
" oh , <name> , what shall we do ? "
gasped <name> .
he stood next in the life line .
" make two lines ! "
cried <name> .
" here , you get hold of one of my feet , and messmer can get hold of the other .
now do n't let go , whatever you do .
i 'll go down after hally . "
" but the danger   " began <name> .
" we ca n't leave hally to smother to death there , <name> .
now then , hold tight , " answered <name> .
the two lines were formed , each end boy holding tight to one of dave's ankles .
then <name> threw himself down in the snow and wormed his way to the edge of the hole .
several feet below he saw one of <name> hally 's hands sticking up , the fingers working convulsively .
he made a clutch and got a firm grip of the wrist .
" haul away ! "
he called .
" but be easy , or the edge of the hole may cave in ! "
under <name> 's directions the boys hauled away with care , and presently poor <name> hally came to the surface of the snow , and was dragged to a safe spot .
he was all but exhausted , and too weak to stand .
" here , we 'll <name> you to the school ! "
cried <name> , and he and some others made a " chair , " and thus the unfortunate lad was carried to oak hall , where he was placed in a rocking chair in front of a fire .
" i went down all of a sudden , " he explained , when he could talk .
" i yelled for all i was worth , and i saw some of you running towards me .
then i went out of sight , and the next i knew messmer 's feet were on my head .
i caught hold of one foot and was dragged almost to the surface .
then my strength gave out ,  and i hardly know what i did after that . "
" <name> pulled you out , " answered <name> .
" he saw one of your hands sticking out of the snow , and he got us fellows to form two lines , with him on the end . "
" i am very thankful , " said <name> hally , and he gave <name> 's hand a warm squeeze .
" i shall never go near that hollow again ! "
" it 's a dangerous place in the <name> time , " said <name> .
" we should have known better than to have retreated in that direction . "
" well , the army of the red won ! "
cried one of the students .
" say , wasn't it a dandy battle ! "
" it certainly was ! "
answered several others .
doctor <name> was much alarmed to learn that hally and messmer had gone down in a hole in the snow , and he came to see how the former was getting along .
then he praised <name> and his chums for their bravery in effecting a rescue .
in the past hally , who was a rather silent student , had had little to say to the other boys , but now he spoke to <name> , and asked him quite a number of questions concerning himself and the other occupants of dormitories nos .
11 and 12 .
" i 'd like to be in with your bunch , " said he , wistfully .
" i do n't like our crowd very well . "
" where are you ? "
asked <name> .
" in no .
13  with nat poole and his crowd . "
" they are n't very much of nat 's crowd any more , are they ? "
" oh , several boys still stick to him .
but he makes me sick . "
" well , i am sorry , hally , but our rooms are filled up , " said <name> .
" poole is down on you , is n't he ? "
" yes . "
" he told me you and he had had a lot of trouble . "
" so we have  but i claim it was mostly nat 's fault .
he does some pretty mean things . "
" so he does , for a fact , " and <name> hally nodded earnestly .
" he is down on <name> hamilton too , is n't he ? "
" yes , but shadow never did him any harm .
it 's just nat 's mean disposition , " returned <name> ; and there the conversation had to come to an end .
but that talk , coupled with the fact that <name> and his chums had so bravely gone to <name> hally 's rescue , produced an unexpected result .
two days later , when the occupants of dormitories nos .
11 and 12 got up , they were surprised to find , just inside of one of the doors , a big pasteboard box , securely tied with a heavy cord .
" why , what 's this ? "
asked <name> , who was the first to see the box .
" must be a christmas box ! "
cried <name> .
" and yet it is rather early in the season for that . "
" is it addressed to anybody ? "
questioned <name> .
" nothing on it , " announced <name> , after an inspection .
" maybe the box was placed in this room by mistake . "
" let us open it and see what is inside , " suggested <name> vane .
" i second that motion , " added <name> .
" <name> it 's got some nice christmas pies in it . "
" maybe it 's a trick , " cautioned shadow .
" go slow on opening it . "
the boys pushed the box to the center of the dormitory with care , and then <name> cut the cord with his <unk> .
" you open it , " said <name> to <name> .
" i am not afraid , " answered <name> , and took off the cover .
and then what a shout went up !
" our shoes , and boots , and slippers ! "
" where in the world did this come from ! "
" say , i thought my shoes were gone for good ! "
" are they all here ? "
" i guess so .
let us sort 'em out and see . "
hastily the box was turned over , and the contents dumped on the floor .
then began a general sorting out , lasting for several minutes .
" one of my gym .
shoes is missing , " announced <name> .
" perhaps one of the other fellows has it , " suggested <name> , and the shipowner 's son started a fresh search .
but it was of no avail .
every shoe , slipper , and boot that had been taken had been returned excepting one of <name> 's foot coverings .
" well , i do n't care much , " said <name> .
" these shoes were about worn out , anyway . "
" where do you suppose this box came from ? "
asked <name> , and then he gazed curiously at shadow , and the others did the same .
" i  i suppose you think  that is , you imagine i  er  i had something to do with this , " stammered the boy who had on several occasions walked in his sleep .
" do you know anything about it , shadow ? "
asked <name> .
" not the first thing ! "
" did you dream of anything last night ? "
" yes , i dreamed about a  er  a   " stammered the <unk> .
" i  er   oh , it was n't about shoes , or anything like that . "
" well , what was it ? "
demanded <name> , sternly .
" it was about a party , if you must know .
i dreamt i took a girl , and we had a nice time dancing and playing games .
there were n't any shoes in it , " and poor shadow got redder than ever .
<name> looked the box over with care .
it was a common pasteboard box , with nothing on it in the way of writing or advertising .
" this certainly is a mystery , " he said , slowly .
" first the shoes disappear , and now they come back .
i give it up . "
" somebody has been playing a trick on us ! "
declared <name> .
" the question is , who ? "
" i do n't know of anybody who would do such a thing , excepting it was nat poole , " declared <name> .
" well , there is no use of <unk> nat with it , " declared <name> .
" for he would deny it point-blank , unless you could prove it against him . "
the boys talked the affair over until it was time to go down to breakfast , but they could reach no conclusion regarding the mystery .
" maybe it <name> never be explained , " said <name> .
" well , even so , i am glad to get my shoes and slippers back , " lisped <name> vane .
a few days after the restoration of the foot coverings there came a thaw and then a sudden cold snap .
ice began to form on the river , and soon it was thick enough for skating , much to the <name> of the students , for nearly all of them loved to skate .
some of the boys had <unk> , and these were also brought out for use .
" i understand that rockville is going to put out a strong <unk> team this <name> , " said <name> to <name> one day .
" they are going to challenge us , too . "
" well , we 'll have to make up a team to beat 'em , " answered <name> .
" that wo n't be so easy , " declared another student .
" they have some great skaters and hockey players at the military academy this season .
they've got one player who is a <name> . "
" who is that ? "
" <name> <name> .
he came from down east , and he is the <unk> <unk> player you ever set eyes on . "
" well , if they challenge us we 'll do our best , " declared <name> , and some others said the same .
the next day , after school , <name> had occasion to go to oakdale on an errand .
<name> was going along , but at the last minute had to stay behind , so <name> went alone .
he had scarcely passed out of the school grounds when he noticed that he was being followed .
a tall , thin man had stepped from behind some oak trees , and was coming after him .
" i wonder what that chap was doing around the school ? "
the youth asked himself .
he walked along rapidly , and the man did the same .
then <name> slackened his pace , and the follower did likewise .
" he does n't want to catch up to me , that 's sure , " thought the youth .
" maybe he is afraid i 'll recognize him .
wonder who he is ? "
he turned and looked back .
but the man had his overcoat pulled up and his soft hat pulled far down , and <name> could see little of his face .
" this is a mystery , " mused <name> .
" i am going to speak to him , " and he stopped short and waited for the mysterious individual to come up .
chapter xxiii hooker montgomery 's strange request the stranger approached slowly , as if hoping <name> would go on before he came up .
once he looked towards the fields on either side of the road , as if thinking to turn off .
but no side road was at hand , so he had to either come on or turn back .
" why , it is doctor montgomery ! "
said the lad to himself , as he recognized the man .
then , as he got still closer , <name> saw that the <unk> doctor looked shabby and dissipated .
his nose was exceedingly red , as if he had been drinking , and his overcoat was much worn and so were his shoes .
" how do you do ? "
he said , somewhat gruffly , as he came up to where <name> was standing .
" how are you ? "
returned <name> , coldly , and stepped aside , as if to let the doctor pass .
but instead of doing this the traveling physician came to a somewhat unsteady halt .
" your name is <name> <name> , is n't it ? "
he queried , trying hard to steady a voice that liquor had rendered nervous .
" it is . "
" i guess you know me , doctor montgomery . "
" yes . "
" going to oakdale ? "
" i am . "
" so am i .
if you do n't mind i 'll walk with you .
i want to talk to you . "
" what do you wish ? "
demanded <name> .
the road was rather a lonely one , and he did not fancy the doctor for a companion .
" i 've been wanting to see you for some time , <name> , " answered hooker montgomery , hesitatingly , as if not knowing how to begin .
" fact is , i went up to the school hoping to meet you . "
" why did n't you call for me if you wanted to see me ? "
" well  er  the fact is , doctor <name> and i are not on good terms , that's why .
to tell you the truth , i once sold some of my medicines to some of his hired help , and he did n't like it .
he thinks my medicines are not  er  reliable .
but they are , sir , they are  more reliable than those of most physicians ! "
and hooker montgomery tried to draw himself up and look dignified .
but , to <name> , the effort was a failure .
he could read the fellow thoroughly , and knew him to be what is commonly called a fakir , pure and simple .
" what did you want of me ? "
asked <name> , as they walked on in the direction of oakdale .
" i wished to see you on an important business matter . "
" business ?
what business ? "
" i <name> come to that presently , <name> .
but it is important , very important , i can assure you .
i was going to ask you to call at a certain place in rockville and see me about it . "
" what place ? "
" a boarding-house at which i am stopping .
it is a very nice place , located on the river , and kept by a <name> named <unk>  mrs. <name> <unk> . "
at once <name> remembered the letter picked up on bush island  the letter written by doctor montgomery , and asking jasniff to meet him at <unk> on the river .
in that communication the doctor had said he would aid jasniff all he could , provided the rockville student would assist him in some transaction involving little risk  which would mean that there must be something " shady " about it .
" ca n't you explain the business to me without my going to rockville ? "
he asked .
" i can not .
i have some things at the boarding-house  some letters and documents  i wish to show you .
day after to-morrow is saturday .
can't you come to rockville in the afternoon and see me ?
i can assure you , sir , it is very important , very important indeed ! "
and doctor montgomery gave <name> a mysterious look .
" do the letters and documents concern me personally ? "
" they concern you , and  shall i tell you ?
yes , i <name> !
they concern you and your sister .
but do n't ask me to say more now .
i <name> explain all when you come to see me . "
<name> began to think rapidly .
this fellow was friendly with jasniff and probably with merwell also .
once merwell had caused <name> <name> much annoyance by holding certain letters she had written .
was it possible merwell still had some of her letters , and was he planning to make more trouble because of them ?
" i do n't understand this business , doctor montgomery , " he said , frankly .
" if it was so important why did n't you write to me , or telephone ? "
" i <name> explain .
this is important to you and your sister .
it would hurt your reputation to make anything public .
i want to do things on the quiet , see ?
acting entirely in your interests , <name> .
you <name> understand it all when you call and  er  see the letters and documents , and the photographs , especially the photographs . "
" all right then  i 'll come  if i can get off . "
" about three o'clock in the afternoon ? "
" between three and four . "
" very good , sir , very good indeed .
you <name> not regret coming , i can assure you , sir .
but one thing more .
let me caution you to say nothing to your school friends of this visit .
i wish you to come entirely alone . "
" why alone ? "
demanded <name> , suspiciously .
" because i wish to protect myself as well as you and your sister .
i want no witnesses to our meeting , as i wish to avoid all trouble .
i shall be alone , and i wish you to be alone also . "
" this is a mighty strange proceeding . "
" possibly , <name> .
but you <name> understand everything when you call .
you need not be afraid .
at present i am the only boarder mrs. <unk> has , and she is old and somewhat deaf .
the house is on the river road , the fourth place above the sawmill .
it is painted light yellow .
you ca n't miss it . "
" and you wo n't tell me any more at present ? "
" i can not .
but on saturday afternoon , if you <name> come to me alone , you shall know all . "
" very well . "
" and one thing more , <name> .
i am going to do you and your family a great favor . "
" well ? "
" i am a poor man .
i could have made money out of my remedies had i charged as some physicians do , but instead i wished to aid humanity , and so sold my priceless medicines for a song .
yes , i am poor , sir , and i need money .
if i aid you   " hooker montgomery paused suggestively .
" if you really do me a favor , you shall be well paid for it , doctor montgomery , " replied <name> , promptly .
" you mean that ? "
and now the doctor 's voice took on a sudden note of keen interest .
" i do . "
" they tell me your folks are <name> . "
" we are well off . "
" ah , ahem !
very good !
then if i do a very great favor for you probably you <name>  er  appreciate it . "
" yes , sir . "
" then it is settled , <name> , and i shall look for you about three o'clock on saturday sure .
and you are to come entirely alone . "
" i understand .
but , listen , doctor montgomery , " went on <name> , and his voice grew stern .
" there is to be no underhanded work in this .
if there is  well , you 'll get the worst of it . "
" oh , no ; nothing of that sort , i can assure you , sir !
you have absolutely nothing to fear , " answered the man hurriedly , but his eyes were rather shifty as he spoke .
" all right , i 'll be on hand ,  if i can get away . "
they had now gained a crossroads , and here the doctor halted .
he looked at <name> as if on the point of speaking again , then simply jerked his head in an attempted dignified fashion , and hurried off , around a bend and out of sight .
it would be hard to analyze <name> 's feelings as he proceeded on his errand to oakdale .
he wondered if doctor montgomery was acting on his own account or for merwell and jasniff , and he also wondered what the mysterious letters and documents and photographs could be .
was it possible that <name> had once given her photograph to merwell , or had it taken when in that rascal 's company ?
if the latter was true , merwell would know that the porters would give a good deal to get the picture , and have the negative destroyed .
" perhaps it is only a scheme to get me to rockville and to some place where jasniff and merwell can lay hands on me , " he mused .
" they 'd like nothing better than to black my eyes and pound me to a jelly .
if i go there alone i 'll have to keep my eyes wide open . "
then <name> remembered what the doctor had said about being a poor man and needing money .
perhaps the fellow thought to " bleed him , " not only in the interest of jasniff and merwell , but also for himself .
" he 'll not get a cent out of me unless he has something of real value to turn over to me , " <name> decided .
" if it 's only a <unk> scheme , he 'll find me as sharp as himself . "
he could make nothing of the fact that the doctor had at first tried to avoid him .
he was half tempted to tell <name> and <name> about the affair , but at last decided to see it through alone .
if there really was something in it about private letters and photographs he would prefer that his chums know nothing of it .
all that evening and throughout friday , <name> was very thoughtful .
his chums noticed it , and <name> and <name> both asked what was wrong .
" nothing wrong , " he answered , with a faint smile .
" you 've got something on your mind , <name> , " went on the senator 's son .
" struck a new girl , or has <name> struck a new fellow ? "
" not as bad as that , <name> .
i was just wondering if i should buy a red necktie or a blue one . "
" rats !
it 's a girl , i 'll wager a new hat . "
" or else <name> is thinking out some new essay with which to capture a prize , " suggested <name> .
" do n't you worry about me , " answered <name> .
" come on out and have a skate , " and thus the subject was dismissed , for the time being .
the <unk> river was in fine condition for skating , and fully two score of students were out , some cutting fancy figures , and a few racing .
among the number was nat poole , clad in a new crimson sweater and wearing a brand new pair of long hockey skates .
" nat is training for hockey , " said <name> .
" he says he is going to organize a team . "
" well , we 'll organize one , too , " answered <name> .
" i always did like field hockey , and i know i 'd like it on the ice . "
" come on , <name> ! "
shouted <name> , circling up on his skates , and doing a " spread eagle . "
" come on where ? "
" get into the race !
we want you , and <name> , and <name> , too . "
" what race is that ? "
" mr. dodsworth wants all the big boys in it .
it 's a race up the river for a mile , and back to the boathouse .
the winner gets a silver <unk> <unk> . "
" all right , i 'm in that ! "
cried the shipowner 's son .
" i need a <unk> . "
" so do i , " added <name> .
" how about it , <name> ? "
" i 'll go in , although my skates are not as sharp as they might be . "
a crowd had gathered to see the race , and in a few minutes the contestants were lined up by the gymnastic teacher .
the <unk> numbered fourteen , and included nat poole , <name> , <name> , <name> , shadow , <name> , and plum .
" all ready ? "
asked mr. dodsworth .
" then go ! "
and away went the long line , the skates flashing brightly in the clear sunlight , and the onlookers cheering , and uttering words of encouragement to their favorites .
chapter xxiv a race on skates " go it , everybody ! "
" may the best <unk> win ! "
" do n't try to skate too fast , <name> .
remember , the race is two miles long ! "
" hello , there goes one fellow down ! "
" it 's <name> watson .
he has lost his skate . "
the last report was correct , and as the skate could not be adjusted without the loss of some time , <name> gave up , and watched the others .
nat poole was exceedingly anxious to win the race , and he had been partly instrumental in getting up the contest .
his new skates were of the best , and it must be admitted that nat was no mean <unk> .
<name> had good skates and so had <name> .
<name> 's skates were only fair , and were very much in need of sharpening .
away went nat at top speed , soon drawing half a dozen yards ahead of his competitors .
behind him came a student named powers , and then followed <name> , <name> , <name> , <name> , and the others .
" i do n't think i can win ! "
sang out <name> to his chums .
" these skates slip too much .
but i 'll do my best . "
" come on , you <unk> ! "
cried <name> , merrily , and then he shot forward until he was abreast of nat .
seeing this , the money-lender 's son put on an extra burst of speed , and went ahead again .
" say , nat poole is certainly skating well ! "
cried one of the onlookers .
" he 'll make a record if he keeps it up . "
" i do n't think he can keep it up , " answered another .
in a very few minutes the turning point was gained , and nat made a sharp curve and started back .
the turn brought him directly in front of <name> .
" clear the track ! "
he roared .
" clear the track , i say ! "
" clear the track yourself ! "
answered <name> .
nevertheless , as nat came closer , he swerved a little to one side so that the money-lender 's son might pass .
as nat swept on he swung his arms freely , and one fist took <name> in the side .
" foul !
foul ! "
cried several who saw the move .
" it was his own fault ! "
nat retorted .
" i told him to get out of the way ! "
and off he started for the finishing line .
<name> said nothing , but kept on , reaching the turning point a few seconds later .
<name> and <name> were just ahead of him , and plum was beside him .
" go on and win ! "
he shouted .
" i ca n't keep up with these skates ! "
" here goes for a finish ! "
yelled <name> , and darted ahead , with <name> at his heels .
then plum flashed forward , and soon the three were side by side , with <name> about three yards to the rear , followed by powers .
coming down the <unk> , nat poole thought he had it all to himself .
he was glad of it , for he had set such a fast pace at the start that he was becoming winded , and he had to fairly gasp for breath .
he looked over his shoulder , and as nobody was near he slackened his speed a little .
" keep it up , nat ! "
yelled one of his supporters .
" go it , old man ! "
" morr and <name> are crawling up ! "
" so is plum ! "
these last cries startled nat , and he sought to strike out as he had at the start .
but his wind was now completely gone  and the finishing line was still a quarter of a mile away .
" there goes morr to the front ! "
" <name> is after him , and so is plum ! "
" here comes basswood ! "
" what 's the matter with <name> ?
he is dropping behind . "
" he said his skates were dull . "
" oh , that 's only an excuse ! "
sneered one of the students who had been put off of the football eleven that term .
" it 's true , " answered <name> hally .
" i saw the skates myself .
ca n't you see how he slips when he strikes out ? "
on and on went the skaters .
nat was still ahead , but now <name> and <name> came up on one side , and <name> plum on the other , while <name> came up close in the rear .
behind <name> was <name> , determined to see the race out even if he did not win .
with the finishing line but a hundred feet away , <name> , <name> , and <name> plum shot to the front .
then <name> followed .
nat poole tried to keep up , but could not .
then of a sudden <name> went ahead also .
" nat is dropping behind ! "
" he put on too much steam at the start ! "
" there goes <name> ahead of him ! "
" see , morr , <name> , and plum are even ! "
" yes , and there comes <name> basswood up to them ! "
" here they come !
clear the way , everybody ! "
with a rush the skaters came on .
for one brief instant <name> was ahead , but then the others put on a burst of speed , and over the line they came , amid a great yelling and cheering .
" a tie between morr , plum , and <name> ! "
" and basswood and <name> tied for second place ! "
" nat poole was n't in it , after all . "
" my skate got loose , " grumbled nat , as he came up slowly .
" if it hadn't been for that i would have won . "
" that 's an old excuse , nat ! "
shouted a boy in the rear of the crowd .
" invent something new ! "
and a laugh went up , that angered the money-lender 's son greatly .
he took his defeat bitterly , and lost no time in leaving the ice and disappearing from view .
" a fine race ! "
declared mr. dodsworth , " but i do n't know how i am to award the prize . "
" cut it in three parts , " suggested <name> .
" say , that puts me in mind of a story , " came from shadow .
" an old irishman was dying and wanted to make his <name> .
'how do ye want to lave <name> money , <name> ' asked his friend .
'sure , ' says <name> ; 'i want to lave it all to me <unk> an ' me four <unk> , equal <unk> , so <unk> <name> gits a quarter ! ' "
" we might have another race , " suggested mr. dodsworth .
" that is , if you are not too tired  i mean , of course , a race between those who were tied . "
" oh , let us cut sticks for it , " suggested <name> .
" that <name> suit me , " said plum .
" me , too , " said the senator 's son .
" i am too tired to race again . "
so the three lads <name> sticks for the prize , and <name> plum won .
" hello !
i 'm in luck ! "
cried <name> , and looked much pleased .
the silver <unk> <unk> was passed over to him , and he thanked the gymnastic instructor warmly for it .
" i am glad he got it , since it pleases him , " said <name> to <name> , and the senator 's son nodded in agreement .
the only boy who felt sore over the race was nat poole , and he continued to declare that he would have won had his skate not come loose .
" but just wait , " he said , to some of the students .
" i 'll show 'em what i can do when we get to playing hockey . "
and that very night he started in to organize an <unk> team .
he did not consult mr. dodsworth or <name> <name> , fearing that they would not favor his selection of players .
" they have nothing to do with hockey , " nat explained to his friends .
" all they have to look after is baseball and football , and track athletics .
doctor <name> did n't say a word about ice hockey , or field hockey , either . "
this was true , the master of the hall having probably forgotten all about those sports .
nevertheless , it was understood by the majority of the students that all games and contests held with parties outside of oak hall were to come under the supervision of the gymnastic instructor and <name> <name> .
" what are you going to do with yourself to-morrow afternoon ? "
asked <name> of <name> , on going to bed friday .
" i have a little business to attend to in rockville , <name> . "
" is that so ?
want me to go along ? "
this was a question <name> had dreaded to have asked , and he hardly knew how to answer .
he determined to be as <name> as possible .
" no , <name> .
i am sorry , but the party i am going to see asked me to come alone . "
" oh , all right .
i just thought i 'd mention it . "
" if it had n't been for that i should like very much to have you and <name> along , " continued <name> , earnestly .
" but i ca n't take anybody . "
" must be going to see a girl , " and the senator 's son looked at his chum quizzically .
" no , it is not a girl .
now please do n't ask me any more questions . "
" just as you say , <name> , " answered <name> , and then began to get ready to go to bed .
he could not help but wonder what the business was , and why <name> was so secretive about it .
in the morning <name> had to go through the same kind of a scene with <name> .
the shipowner 's son was as much mystified as <name> , and after <name> had departed , the pair walked into the warm gymnasium to talk the matter over .
" <name> has something on his mind , " said <name> .
" i noticed it yesterday . "
" so did i , <name> .
what is it , do you suppose ? "
" i do n't know , excepting it may be about merwell and jasniff .
he said it was n't about those girls . "
" do you think he is going to meet merwell and jasniff in rockville ? "
" possibly .
i ca n't think of anything else . "
" if <name> got into trouble , i 'd like to be on hand to help him . "
" so would i .
but i guess <name> knows how to take care of himself . "
and then the subject was dropped , and the two students began to exercise with some indian clubs .
in the meantime , <name> was on his way to rockville .
as the road was clear of snow he used his bicycle , and soon covered the distance to the town .
he passed along the river road to the sawmill , and then kept his eyes open for mrs. <unk> 's house .
" this must be the place , " he said to himself , as he reached a dilapidated residence , located in what had once been a fine flower garden , but which was now a tangle of rank bushes and weeds .
the gate was off , and leaping from his wheel , he trundled his bicycle along the <unk> garden path to the front piazza .
then leaving his wheel against a tree , he mounted the steps and rang the old-fashioned turn <name> .
<name> had approached the house boldly , thinking that possibly somebody might be watching him from behind the blinds of the windows , all of which were closed .
yet he was on his guard , and in the lining of his overcoat he carried a stout stick , with which to defend himself should such a course be necessary .
no one answered his first summons , and he rang the <name> <name> a second time .
then the front door was opened , and doctor montgomery showed himself .
" ah , how do you do ! "
he said , with a bland smile .
" walk right in , mr. <name> .
i see you are on time . "
<name> hesitated for a moment , and then entered the broad hallway of the house .
in front of him was a long flight of stairs leading to the second floor , and on either side were doors leading to the parlor and to a dining-room .
" mrs. <unk> is n't feeling very well , so i had to come to the door myself , " explained hooker montgomery , smoothly .
" she used to take some <unk> medicine and it did her no good .
now she is taking my remedies , and she <name> soon be herself . "
he said this so naturally that <name> was thrown a little off his guard .
as a matter of fact , mrs. <unk> was not at home , having gone away to visit a sister in albany .
it was because of her absence that the tricky doctor had invited <name> to come to the house .
had she been at home his schemes would have necessitated meeting <name> somewhere else .
" doctor , i have n't much time to spare , so i <name> you <name> get at the bottom of what you want without delay , " said <name> , after the door had been closed and locked by the physician .
it was so dark in the hall he could hardly see .
" i 'll not take much of your time , sir ,  not over half an hour at the most , " was the reply from hooker montgomery .
" but all of the documents and letters and photographs are in my room , on the second floor .
kindly come up there and look at them . "
and the man started up the stairs .
<name> hesitated for a moment , wondering if it would be best to go up , and then followed .
chapter xxv in the hands of the enemy at the head of the stairs the doctor paused , and then opened a door leading to a back bedroom .
the apartment had two windows , but the blinds were closed , what little light there was coming in through the <unk> slats .
" i have to shut off a good deal of light on account of my eyes , " explained the doctor , as he saw <name> glance at the blinds .
" my eyes are very weak , and i am told that the sunlight is very bad for them . "
" i am sorry to hear that , " answered <name> .
he hardly knew what to say or how to act .
his reception had not been what he had anticipated , and he could not imagine what was coming next .
" here are some of the documents i wish you to look over first  and then we 'll talk business , " said hooker montgomery , pointing to a mass of <unk> papers lying on the bed .
" you can take them to the window if you wish , " and he sank down in a rocking-chair , as if tired out , and placed both hands over his eyes .
curious to know what the documents might contain of importance to him , <name> took some of them up and stepped close to one of the windows .
the writing was poor , and it was hard to make out what had been written .
his face was bent closely over one of the pages when of a sudden he felt some unusual movement behind him .
he started to turn , but before he could do so , a big bag was thrown over his head and arms , and tied around his waist .
at the same instant he was tackled around the legs , and his ankles were tied together .
of course he struggled , and for several minutes his would-be captors had all they could do to hold him .
but he had been taken so completely off his guard that resistance proved useless .
soon a rope was passed around the bag and over his arms , and further struggling was out of the question .
" who are you ? "
he demanded , in a muffled tone , for inside of the bag it was all he could do to breathe .
the covering was so heavy he could not see a thing .
no answer was vouchsafed to his question .
he was backed up against the bed , and made to sit down , and then he heard his captors leave the room , locking the door after them .
<name> was both chagrined and angry  chagrined to think that he had been taken in so easily , and angry to think that he was a prisoner and at his captors ' <name> .
" this must be the work of merwell and jasniff , " he thought .
" they simply hired the doctor to get me here .
there is nothing in the story of documents , letters , and photographs .
what a fool i was to walk into the trap ! "
and then he wondered when his captors would return , and what they proposed to do with him .
for fully a quarter of an hour <name> waited , straining his ears to catch every sound .
from below came a murmur of voices , but what was said he could not learn .
once he thought he recognized jasniff 's rough tones , but he was not sure .
tired of sitting on the edge of the bed , <name> got up and tried to move around .
then he made the discovery that his ankles were tied to a rope that was secured to the bed , and that the latter was stationary .
" i 'm a prisoner , and no mistake , " he reasoned , grimly .
" i wonder how long they intend to keep me here ? "
the room was cold , and he was glad that he had his overcoat on .
his cap had fallen off inside the bag , but his thick hair and the bag prevented his catching cold in the head .
" guess i 'll wake them up a bit , " he thought , and so commenced to stamp on the floor .
then he stamped louder , until he felt he must be knocking the plaster from the ceiling below .
he was in the midst of the stamping when the door of the room was thrown open and somebody came in .
" stop that noise , or i 'll knock you down ! "
said a sharp voice , and at the same instant a strong hand was placed on his shoulder , and he was given a vigorous shake .
<name> was surprised , for the voice was not that of doctor montgomery , neither did it belong to merwell nor jasniff .
yet , in some way , the voice sounded familiar .
" what are you going to do with me ? "
demanded <name> , as he stopped his stamping .
" you 'll find that out later , <name> .
now keep quiet ,  if you know when you are well off . "
" i want to know now .
you have no right to treat me in this fashion .
i'll have you and doctor montgomery put in jail for it . "
" you shut up ! "
cried the stranger , and he gave <name> a shove that sent him back on the bed .
" you make any more noise and i 'll quiet you in a way you wo n't like ! "
and then the fellow left the room again , and the door was locked as before .
feeling that he might be attacked and seriously injured if he kept up the noise , <name> remained quiet , and thus the remainder of the afternoon passed .
as night came on the room became dark and extra cold , and he shivered in spite of himself .
" if they leave me here all night i 'll be frozen stiff , " he thought , grimly .
" oh , why did n't i tell <name> and <name> where i was going !
they might come to the rescue ! "
after another wait <name> heard more talking below , and then three persons came upstairs and into the room .
" now , you keep real quiet and you wo n't get hurt , " said the person who had spoken before .
" if you start to raise a row  well , you 'll wish you had n't , that 's all . "
" what are you going to do ? "
" keep quiet , and you 'll find out before very long . "
" do you know this is a very high-handed proceeding ? "
" shut up ! "
the tone was extra sharp , and <name> received a rough shake of the shoulder .
not knowing but what he might be knocked down , he relapsed into silence .
presently his feet were unfastened , and he was led out of the room and down the stairs .
then the party made its way to the rear of the house , and went outside .
" now we are going to give you a little <unk> for your health , " said the person who had spoken before .
as there was no snow on the ground <name> felt this must mean a ride on the river , and he was not mistaken .
a horse and a low <unk> were at hand , and into the turnout <name> was lifted , the fellow who had spoken getting on one side of him and somebody else on the other .
then still another party took up the reins , and started to drive off , over the ice , which was just thick enough to bear the weight of such an outfit .
although <name> 's arms were tied to his sides , he could move his hands a little , and he managed to get hold of a good-sized pin , which had been fastened to a corner of his overcoat .
as the sleigh moved over the smooth surface of the river he resolved to make an effort to learn the identity of the silent fellow beside him , and so moved the pin around , and shoved it towards the individual as far as possible .
" ouch ! "
came the sudden exclamation , as the point of the pin reached its <name> , and the fellow leaped partly to his feet .
" what in thunder   " and then the speaker broke off short .
" i know you , link merwell ! "
cried <name> .
" i thought all along it was you . "
" i 'm not merwell ! "
growled the fellow , in a deep voice .
" do n't you dare to stick me with that pin again , or i 'll mash you ! "
and then he refused to say any more .
but he gave <name> 's arm such a pinch that it was black and blue for a long time afterwards .
with the bag over his head , <name> could not hear very well , yet he felt tolerably certain that the fellow was link merwell , and if this was so , then most likely the driver of the sleigh was <name> jasniff .
but who the third party could be was still a mystery .
" some old enemy i have forgotten , " reasoned the captive .
and then he wondered where he was being taken , and for what purpose .
after a ride of half an hour the sleigh came to a halt , and <name> was ordered to get out .
then he was marched up a steep bank and up some steps .
a door was opened , and all of the party entered a building of some sort .
he was placed in a room and tied fast to a ring fastened in the floor .
" now you behave yourself and you 'll soon be freed and treated to a hot supper , " said the man who appeared to be the spokesman for the crowd .
" but if you make a row you 'll not be freed , and you 'll not get a mouthful . "
then <name> was left alone once more , and all three of his captors apparently left the building .
the room was warm , and for this the captive was grateful .
a chair had been placed for him to sit upon , so he was fairly comfortable .
an hour passed and during that time all was silent .
then somebody came in and started to release his arms and take the bag from his head .
it was a man , tall and muscular , and <name> felt sure he had seen him before , but where he could not remember .
the man wore a mask , made of a handkerchief with holes cut in it for his eyes .
" sorry i ca n't let you go just yet , " he said .
" but here is something to eat and to drink . "
and he pointed to a table , upon which rested a lamp , for it was now late in the evening and dark .
on the table was a cup of hot tea and several cheese sandwiches and a small baker 's pie .
" well , i 'm hungry , that 's certain , " said <name> , grimly .
" and if i 've got to stay here i might as well eat . "
" that 's the sensible way to talk , " answered the man .
" when are you going to let me go ? "
" i ca n't say yet  most likely in the morning . "
" why did you bring me here ? "
" just for fun . "
" you 've taken a lot of trouble for your fun , " said <name> .
he did not believe the man 's statement .
" eat your supper , <name> , " growled the man , and sank down on a chair close to the door .
" no funny work now , mind you ! "
and he <unk> the very stick <name> had carried for <unk> .
there was no help for it , and sitting down to the table <name> began to eat and to drink .
the sandwiches were fresh , and so was the pie , and as the ride in the keen air had given him an appetite , he disposed of them quickly .
the tea tasted rather bitter , but he was dry and speedily drained the cup .
the man watched him drink , with evident satisfaction .
" now you had better lie down and try and get a little rest , " said the fellow of the mask .
" when i want you i 'll call you . "
and so speaking he left the room , locking the door after him .
as soon as the man was gone <name> tried to loosen the rope that bound his feet together .
it was a hard task and took some time , and bending over seemed to make his head swim .
when he straightened up his head grew even more dizzy , and almost before he knew it he was staggering around .
" what a queer sensation ! "
was his thought .
" what in the world is the matter with me ? "
and then like a flash came the answer .
" that tea !
it must have been drugged ! "
the captive was right in his surmise .
the tea had been drugged , and soon poor <name> felt so dizzy he had to rest on the bed .
he tried several times to rouse up , and then his senses forsook him completely .
<name> had been unconscious for about a quarter of an hour when the man came in , looked at him , and shook him .
then he went below .
" well , we 've got him , " he said to the others .
" he is practically dead to the world . "
" good ! "
was the answer .
" better bring him down right away .
we want to get this job over . "
chapter xxvi a dash for <name> when <name> regained his senses he found himself in the tonneau of a big automobile that was speeding swiftly over a dark country road .
on either side of him sat a person who was masked , and in front were two persons whose faces he could not see .
his hands were tied behind him , and his ankles were made fast to the <unk> in the bottom of the tonneau .
he wondered where he was being taken , but knew it would be useless to ask any questions .
how long he had been unconscious he did not know , but felt it must have been a considerable time , for it was now night , and whenever they passed a farmhouse it was without lights , showing the occupants had gone to bed .
<name> fully realized that he was in a position of peril .
his enemies had treated him in an outrageous fashion , and what they proposed to do next there was no telling .
he felt that he must escape if it could possibly be accomplished .
he had roused up a little , but now deemed it best to let the others think he was still unconscious .
accordingly , he uttered a deep sigh , and then slipped further down on the seat , and let his head fall forward on his breast .
" pretty well dosed , " he heard one of the party murmur , and now he was sure he recognized <name> jasniff 's voice .
" say , <unk> , i <name> you did n't give him too much of the drug , " said another of the party , and <name> felt certain it was link merwell who was speaking .
" if he should n't recover   " " oh , he 'll come around all right enough , " growled the man called <unk> .
he was running the automobile , and now <name> was able to place him as a fellow who worked around a livery stable and garage in rockville .
<unk> was a drinking man , and his reputation was far from an enviable one .
" how much further have we to go ? "
asked jasniff , after a few minutes of silence .
" not far , " answered the driver of the automobile .
" we 'll take to the side road now .
hold fast , it 's pretty rough , " and then the touring car turned off the main highway and began bumping over the rocks and ruts of a narrow wood road .
the way was uphill , and the driver had to throw in his second speed to gain the top of the rise .
then the car made a sharp turn , and halted in front of a stone building .
" is this the place ? "
asked jasniff .
" yes , " answered <unk> .
" wait till i light a lantern , and then you can bring him in . "
" i shall have to care for him when we are in the house , " said the fourth person of the party who had carried <name> off .
it was doctor montgomery , and his breath was thick from liquor .
still thinking he might get a chance to escape if he made out that he was unconscious , <name> <name> limp in the automobile , and allowed his captors to lift him out and place him on the ground .
then he was carried into the stone building and placed on a bench .
" you certainly dosed him strongly , " said hooker montgomery .
" i had better make an examination .
loosen up his hands and feet . "
a little bit alarmed , jasniff and merwell set to work and released <name> from his bonds .
in the meantime <unk> had lit a lantern , and placed it on a rough table .
doctor montgomery got out a medicine case , and began to mix up a <unk> in a glass .
" this ought to bring him around , " he said , in a thick , unsteady voice .
<name> did not dare to look around , but by the draught in the room he knew that the door must have been left open , probably to give him more air .
he did not think the disreputable physician was in any condition to administer his medicines , and he did not propose to swallow any if he could avoid it .
" i must escape , " he thought , and with a moan , as if in great pain , he twisted around , and opened his eyes for an instant .
that instant was long enough for him to locate the doorway , and beyond he made out a stretch of woodland , lit up by the lamps of the automobile .
between him and the doorway stood merwell and jasniff , with <unk> and the doctor on the other side .
" shall i hold his head , doctor ? "
asked merwell .
" maybe he wo n't be able to swallow if   " merwell got no further , for just then <name> leaped to his feet with an agility that surprised even himself .
stiff though he was , he ran at merwell , hurling him flat .
then he bumped into jasniff , who made a weak attempt to stop him .
the two swung around , and jasniff was sent crashing into the table , knocking over the lantern .
then <name> leaped for the doorway .
" stop him ! "
" he must not get away ! "
" ouch !
do n't step on me ! "
came from link merwell .
he was on his back , and jasniff 's foot had landed on his stomach .
the four rascals had been taken completely by surprise .
as the lantern fell it went out , and in his endeavor to get to the doorway , <unk> bumped into jasniff .
the doctor ran into the bench , and his glass of medicine went splashing into merwell 's face , <unk> another protest from that bully .
<name> did not care about what happened in the building .
his one thought was to get away , for he fully realized that in a hand-to-hand encounter he would be no match for his four enemies .
had he had time he might have jumped into the automobile , and started up the machine .
but he was afraid to risk this , and so ran down the wood road a short distance , and then plunged into the bushes .
he did not stop there , but kept on , until he calculated that he was a full quarter of a mile from the stone building .
" i do n't think they can follow me to here , at least not in the darkness , " he told himself .
he stopped to rest and to consider what he had best do next .
the effects of the drug were now entirely gone , and he felt once more like himself .
" i ought to have the whole crowd locked up , " he reasoned .
" but it would be the testimony of one against four , and they would most likely deny everything . "
he went on again , and presently came out on the main highway .
as he did this he saw the flash of some lamps in the distance .
he crouched down behind some bushes , and a minute later saw the automobile <unk> by , with his enemies in it .
" they are going back , " he reasoned .
" i suppose now i have gotten away from them , merwell and jasniff <name> return to the academy as fast as they can , and <unk> and the doctor <name> return to rockville ; and they'll all play the innocent . "
as he walked on , <name> wondered what the plot against him was .
he felt convinced that carrying him off was only the beginning of it .
" well , whatever it was , i nipped it in the <name> , " he thought .
" perhaps some day i 'll find out all about it ,  some day when i can corner one or another of that rascally bunch .
i take it that <unk> and montgomery are simply in the employ of jasniff and merwell .
both of them are hard <unk> and willing to do almost anything to get a few dollars . "
not far down the highway <name> passed a signboard which told him that rockville was ten miles away .
" i ca n't walk ten miles , " he thought .
" i had better see if i ca n't get accommodations at some farmhouse , and then drive over to the school after breakfast . "
with this idea in view he kept on , until he reached a spot where the railroad crossed the highway .
as he did this he saw a freight train standing near a siding where a milk car was to be taken on .
" does this train go to oakdale ? "
he asked , of one of the hands .
" yes , but it is n't a passenger train , " was the reply .
" ca n't you take me along ? "
questioned <name> .
" i wish to get to oakdale very much , and without delay . "
the train hand looked <name> over by the light of his lantern .
he saw that the youth was no tramp .
" all right , get in the <unk> , " he said .
" but it <name> cost you a smoke . "
" i have n't any cigars , but you can buy yourself some , " answered <name> , and passed over a quarter of a dollar , which the train hand pocketed with satisfaction .
soon the train was under way , and in less than half an hour they reached the siding at oakdale , and there <name> jumped off .
by his watch the lad saw that it was three o'clock <name> morning .
without delay he struck off on foot for the school .
as he hurried on he wondered what he had best do on arriving at oak hall .
should he rouse up doctor <name> and tell the master the whole story , or would it be better to say nothing and await developments ?
" if i say anything there <name> be a great <unk> , but it wo n't prove anything , " he reasoned .
" merwell and jasniff <name> deny everything , and so <name> <unk> , and that fake doctor might take it into his head to <name> me for slander .
no , i 'll fight my own battles , and see if i ca n't corner them on my own hook .
but i 'll tell <name> and <name> . "
arriving at the school grounds , <name> wondered how he was going to get in without being observed .
he tried all the doors , to find each locked .
" if i ring the <name> i 'll have to explain matters , " he said to himself .
" i 'll see if i ca n't rouse up some of the fellows . "
he walked around to the window of no .
11 , and threw several <unk> of gravel up against the glass .
at first there was no response , but presently the window was raised , and <name> 's head appeared .
" is that you , <name> ? "
asked the senator 's son , in a low voice .
" yes , <name> .
<name> you slip down and let me in . "
" sure thing .
<name> the side door do ? "
" yes . "
no more was said , and the window was closed .
<name> hurried to the door mentioned , and a moment later <name> opened it , and he entered .
then both hurried upstairs , making as little noise as possible .
" what kept you so long ? "
asked the senator 's son , while <name> was undressing .
" i 'll tell you and <name> in the morning , " was <name> 's reply .
" i 've got a yarn to spin you <name> hardly believe . "
and then he went to bed .
but it was a long time before he was able to drop asleep , and then his dreams were little short of a nightmare .
it was not until <name> afternoon that <name> got a chance to tell his two chums the particulars of what had occurred .
they listened with keen attention to all he said , and the face of each plainly expressed his amazement .
" that 's the worst ever ! "
was <name> 's comment .
" what were they going to do with you , <name> ? "
" i do n't know . "
" i believe it was some <unk> plot , " said <name> .
" your getting away spoiled it all . "
" for them , yes ,  but not for me , " answered <name> , with something of a grin .
" i do n't know what i escaped , but i am mighty glad i got away . "
" what about your bicycle ? "
asked the senator 's son .
" are n't you going to try to get that back ? "
" certainly ,  and i am going to interview that doctor montgomery , too ,  if i can catch him .
but i want you two to go along , " answered <name> .
he was glad to take it easy for the rest of the day .
on monday , after school , the three boys went to rockville on bicycles , <name> borrowing a wheel belonging to <name> .
they rode straight to the <unk> house , to find it locked up tightly .
in the yard was <name> 's machine , standing against the tree as he had left it .
" i guess the doctor has come and gone , " said <name> , after trying all the doors .
" most likely he 'll make himself scarce for a while . "
" why not interview that fellow <unk> ? "
suggested <name> .
" i <name> , " answered <name> , and taking the extra wheel along , the three students rode around to the rockville livery stable and garage .
here <name> asked the proprietor about <unk> .
" he has gone , " said the man , sourly .
" day before yesterday he took one of my best autos for a <name> ride .
when he came back this morning i discharged him .
he took his things and got out  and i do n't know where he went to . "
this was as much as the garage owner could tell , and with it <name> had to be content .
he and his chums turned away ; and a little later set out on the return to oak hall .
chapter xxvii a game of ice hockey " i reckon you scared them pretty thoroughly , <name> . "
" i am glad of it if i did , " answered <name> .
" i <name> i scared them so much that they never bother me again . "
several days had passed , and in that time <name> had learned many things .
from rockville had come the news that doctor montgomery had left rather suddenly , without stating where he was going , and <name> had likewise learned that <unk> had not shown himself since his discharge by the garage owner .
and now from the military academy came word that merwell and jasniff had obtained leave of absence for a week .
" they say doctor montgomery must have been getting ready to leave , " said <name> , who had been to rockville .
" he owes a board <name> at the hotel as well as at his boarding-house .
mrs. <unk> is back , and is very angry to think the doctor got away during her absence . "
" i suppose merwell and jasniff think the affair <name> blow over by the time they return , " said <name> .
" well , <name> , you can do as you please , but if i were you i 'd try to corner them . "
" if i did that , <name> , they 'd try to squirm out of it somehow .
what i'd like to do best of all would be to give merwell and jasniff a good thrashing . "
" well , they deserve that , <name> . "
" i believe they were going to place you in some kind of an awkward position , " came from <name> .
" maybe they were going to commit some crime and try to fasten it on you . "
" well , whatever it was , they got left , " declared <name> .
" by the way , did you see the notice nat poole posted up in the <unk> ? "
asked <name> , during a pause .
" no .
what is it ? "
" he has lost a watch-chain charm , and he offers a dollar reward for its return . "
" as if the fellows would n't return it without a reward , if it was found ! "
